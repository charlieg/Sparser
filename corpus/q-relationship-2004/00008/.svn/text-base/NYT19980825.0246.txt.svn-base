BOSTON --
Virtually the same compound that was found outside a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and led to last week 's US rocket strike was also found in the blood of a man who had been killed by VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult , a team of scientists reported here Tuesday .
Speaking at a meeting of the American Chemical Society , chemist Anthony Tu said that the compound , called EMPTA , is `` unique for VX , '' the deadliest nerve gas known , and has no other chemical function .
It exists only as an ingredient for the manufacture of VX , or as a product of its breakdown after use , he said .
Tu , a specialist in chemical weapons who teaches at Colorado State University and was one of the specialists called in by Japanese officials in the aftermath of a deadly attack by sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in 1995 , said that VX had been used by the same cult group in an attack on a 28-year -old man in December 1994 .
In that attack , the deadly compound was sprayed directly on the victim 's skin .
The man lost consciousness immediately and died 10 days later , although the cause of his death was not determined at the time .
It was a year later , after members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had confessed to the subway attack and also to the separate VX attack , that scientists analyzed a blood sample that had been taken from the VX victim .
After all that time , the distinctive EMPTA was still clearly evident in the blood sample , said Dr. Hitoshi Tsuchihashi of the Osaka Police Institute Forensic Science Laboratory .
Tsuchihashi said no research had been published in the scientific literature about the metabolism of VX and its breakdown products , so the discovery of EMPTA in the man 's blood could lead to a diagnostic test to determine if the agent was used used in any future attacks .
The victim of that 1994 attack is the only person ever known to have died from VX poisoning , Tsuchihashi said .
Tsuchihashi and his colleagues have also studied the break-down products of sarin gas and other forms of nerve gas that might be used by terrorists .
Tu said that a team of American specialists was sent to Japan shortly after the subway attack in 1995 , but Japanese officials were not willing to share detailed information with them and the group `` came back empty-handed . ''
That 's why , he said , he decided to organize a session at this year 's chemical society meeting to share the lessons learned from that attack with American scientists and emergency officials .
All of the key forensic scientists , biochemists and doctors who participated in the treatment of the victims of the sarin attack had been invited to participate , he said .
At least 12 deaths were attributed to the sarin attack .
Those deaths could have been prevented , said Dr. Tetsu Okumura of the department of acute medicine at Japan 's Kawasaki Medical School , if the information had been available for a proper medical response .
Okumura , who was one of the doctors in the emergency room at St. Luke 's hospital in Tokyo , where many of the victims were treated , said emergency medical personnel in his country are not allowed to perform intubations -- a treatment to open blocked airways -- at the scene of an emergency .
Such treatment would have ensured the survival of all the sarin victims , he said , adding that nerve gases cause paralysis , and those who received the largest doses of sarin were unable to breathe .
Although sarin `` victims , adequately intubated , never die , '' he said , `` in present Japanese law , EMTs cannot save the victim .
But in the US , many paramedics can do intubation at the site . ''
The other treatment given in the sarin poisoning was a compound called PAM , which is also used to treat some pesticide poisonings .
As a result , in Japan the compound is routinely stocked in rural hospitals where pesticide poisonings are more common , but not in urban hospitals .
That policy needs to be re-examined in light of recent terrorist activity , he said .
The sarin victims were also treated with atropine , which is routinely stocked in hospitals , Okumura said .
But even that was not available in sufficient quantity to deal with the massive subway attack , which affected more than 5,000 people .
Only the most severely affected patients received atropine , but many others might have been spared long-term symptoms if the treatment had been available .
Dr. Tsuchihashi said a large-scale study is being carried out to monitor survivors of the subway attack , to learn what long-term effects their exposure to the gas may produce .
