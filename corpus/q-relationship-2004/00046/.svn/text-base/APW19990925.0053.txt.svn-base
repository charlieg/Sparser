GROZNY , Russia
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Russia 's air force pumped up the pressure on breakaway Chechnya on Saturday , knocking local television and radio off the air and sending tens of thousands of civilians fleeing toward neighboring regions .
It was the third day of punishing airstrikes on the capital , Grozny .
Russia 's air campaign had been focused on bombing suspected rebel bases , but now it is targeting economic installations and civilian communications facilities as well .
Warplanes bombed the republic 's television station in Grozny on Friday and early Saturday and damaged the equipment beyond repair , Russian media reported .
Chechen officials said seven people were killed and 24 wounded in the overnight air raid on the television station , the Interfax news agency reported .
The Russian military says it is trying to prevent incursions of Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan .
The militants , who want to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Russia , entered Dagestan and fought Russian forces in August and September .
They have been linked to terrorist bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities this month .
Saturday 's airstrikes also knocked out a radio tower in the village of Goyskoye , 12 miles southwest of Grozny , Chechen officials said .
Interfax reported that Chechnya 's cellular communications station was also destroyed , but that report was not officially confirmed .
The air raids took out Grozny 's oil refinery on Friday , and energy officials told Interfax that all refinery operations had come to a standstill Saturday .
The refinery was burning out of control , said Bekhan Islamov , head of the Grozny fire department , and a thick pall of smoke hung over the city .
`` There are no means to stop the fire , '' Islamov said .
As Russia has shifted its air attacks from outlying villages to Grozny , tens of thousands of civilians have tried to leave the republic .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">An estimated 100,000 Chechens crowded the border crossing between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia on Saturday</ENAMEX> .
The line of cars and trucks waiting at the border stretched for miles .
Russian border guards only occasionally opened the crossing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Ingush authorities said some 20,000 Chechens had sought refuge there by Saturday -- most of them arriving by foot , crossing the border away from official checkpoints -- and that Ingushetia could not cope with the huge number .
`` We are on the verge of a humanitarian disaster , '' said Akhmed Malsagov , the acting head of the Ingush government</ENAMEX> .
Russia 's Air Force commander , Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov , told reporters Saturday that Russian airstrikes beginning in early August had killed more than 2,000 militants and destroyed some 250 rebel strongholds and training centers in Chechnya and Dagestan .
Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic 's border with Dagestan .
The air raids and the concentration of Russian troops have fanned fears of a full-scale war in Chechnya .
Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996 .
But Moscow still claims it is a part of Russia and has struggled to keep violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region .
Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya .
They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya , Russian media reported Saturday .
The two admitted that they had been trained for sabotage at a camp run by Khattab , an Arab warlord based in Chechnya , the reports said .
They did not say when the men were detained .
Elsewhere , Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya .
