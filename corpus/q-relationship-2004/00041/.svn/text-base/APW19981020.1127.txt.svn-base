BERN , Switzerland
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Switzerland 's federal prosecutor on Tuesday ordered the confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million in accounts in Switzerland and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation into the brother of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
Raul Salinas is in prison in Mexico pending completion of trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal enrichment during his brother 's 1988-1994 administration .
Carla del Ponte said the investigation had concluded that funds in the accounts , of which Raul Salinas de Gortari is co-owner , came partly from protection payoffs from drug traffickers .
The Swiss halted their own proceedings on charges of money laundering against Raul Salinas and three co-defendants , but said their findings `` inevitably suggest money laundering '' of drug profits .
Del Ponte said Switzerland could n't try Salinas because he is imprisoned in Mexico .
Mexican proceedings against Salinas and others on money laundering charges made a Swiss criminal case unnecessary , she added .
Most of the money seized -- dlrs 89.9 million -- ordered confiscated is in Swiss bank accounts .
But a further dlrs 24.5 million is in London , administered by a Swiss -based financial institution .
Salinas ' lawyers can appeal the decision , taken Monday , within ten days .
That would send the case to Switzerland 's supreme court , but Del Ponte said she was `` very confident '' it would uphold the seizure .
At a Mexico City news conference , Raul Salinas ' lawyer , Eduardo Luengo Creel , said he would appeal .
In a letter written from his prison cell in central Mexico , Raul Salinas accused the Swiss prosecutors of illegally trying to grab his money .
He said they relied on questionable witnesses , exaggerated the size of his accounts and falsely accused him of taking bribes from drug smugglers .
Salinas has denied any links to drug traffickers and said the money was an investment fund pooled by several wealthy friends .
In his letter , Salinas said the `` sole purpose of the Swiss authorities is to illegally take control of the money . ''
Despite Raul Salinas ' claims of innocence , Del Ponte said `` the business dealings he claims are beyond all economic logic . ''
Valentin Roschacher , the chief of Switzerland 's antinarcotics police , said investigators concluded that Colombia 's Medellin and Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments through Mexico .
Witnesses spoke of `` green light days '' on which , after agreement between drug traffickers and corrupt officials , drugs destined for the United States could be transported through Mexico on certain routes .
`` With all his contacts and his power , he could guarantee protection for those loads , '' Roschacher added .
Salinas ' contacts with drug traffickers started in the 1980s and became more intense under his brother 's presidency in the early 1990s , he continued .
Seven countries including Mexico and the United States collaborated with the Swiss inquiry .
Six U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration analysts helped with the investigation in Bern at various points , Roschacher said .
The investigators interviewed 78 witnesses , 31 of them bank employees , and 16 of them had to testify anonymously for their own safety , Roschacher said .
Raul Salinas himself was questioned four times .
A number of witnesses have been killed in Mexico in the course of the investigation , he added .
Swiss authorities did not release the full 230-page police report on Salinas .
Authorities seized his Swiss bank accounts in 1995 .
Some dlrs 7.8 million have since been unblocked as the money was proved unlinked to drugs or protection payments , Del Ponte said .
Salinas is in prison pending completion of his trials on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of political rival Jose Francisco Ruiz Masseiu , and of illicit enrichment while he held a midlevel government post in his brother 's administration .
No drug-related charges have been brought against Salinas and he was acquitted of money laundering on a technicality .
