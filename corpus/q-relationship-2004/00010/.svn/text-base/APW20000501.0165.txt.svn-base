WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Three countries courted by the United States for a better relationship -- Iran , Syria and North Korea -- were again branded as sponsors of terrorism by the State Department Monday along with Cuba , Iraq , Libya and Sudan .
A yearly report showed a shift in concern from the Middle East to South Asia , where Afghanistan is a favorite haven for terrorists and Pakistan has backed groups that engage in violence in Kashmir , a territory contested with India .
Michael Sheehan , who runs the department 's counterterrorism office , said the Taliban , which controls most of Afghanistan , professes to want good relations with the United States .
But numerous terrorist groups operate on territory Taliban controls , he said at a news conference that coincided with release of the 107-page glossy report .
Among them is the loosely linked al- Qaida organization , headed by Saudi Osama bin Laden .
He is accused of masterminding the bombings last year of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
A total of 230 people died .
Meanwhile , the Pakistan government has tolerated terrorists living and moving freely within its territory and supported groups in Kashmir that engage in violence , said the report entitled `` Patterns of Global Terrorism 1999 . ''
Pakistan is not branded a sponsor of terrorism , though .
Under law , that would prohibit all but humanitarian assistance from the United States .
Cuba , however , is listed again .
In 85 words , the government of Fidel Castro is charged with continuing to provide haven to several terrorists and U.S. fugitives .
Colombia 's two largest terrorist organizations , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army , maintained a permanent presence on the island , the report said .
The Clinton administration has maintained long-standing sanctions against Cuba and avoided any diplomatic overtures .
It also keeps an icy distance from Iraq and Sudan .
The U.S. stance toward Libya is under review .
Two Libyans will be tried this week for the deaths of the 270 passengers , crew and residents of Lockerbie , Scotland , when a Pan Am jumbo jet was blown out of the sky in December 1988 .
Among the victims were 189 Americans aboard the plane .
Sheehan said Libya will remain on the terrorism list .
But he also said world sanctions had driven Libya `` out of the terrorism business '' and its links to terrorism have dropped dramatically since the 1980s .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is weighing whether to revoke a ban on U.S. travel to the North African country .
Iran , Syria and North Korea , all courted for a better relationship with the U.S. , were condemned in the report .
It said Iran and Syria have continued to support regional terrorist groups that seek to destroy the U.S. peace campaign in the area .
And yet , President Clinton journeyed to Geneva , Switzerland , this year to urge Syrian President Hafez Assad to resume negotiations with Israel .
And Albright , in a landmark initiative , offered a dialogue to Iran that could lead to a restoration of relations broken after Iranian militants overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took its residents hostage .
Albright has stressed , though , that the agenda would include U.S. allegations Iran backed terrorists and tried to subvert the peace process .
North Korea is accused in the report of providing haven to Japanese Communist League - Red Army Faction members who participated in the hijacking of a Japanese Airlines flight to North Korea in 1970 .
American officials meet regularly with North Korean officials and the United States provided food and arranged for two civilian reactors and energy supplies in a trade-off for North Korea suspending its nuclear weapons program .
The State Department said the number of persons killed or wounded in terrorist attacks fell sharply last year -- to 233 killed and 706 wounded from 741 and 5,952 , respectively , in 1998 .
Albright said the report was `` largely heartening , '' with the number of Americans killed the lowest in seven years .
She also criticized Congressional proposals to cut more than $ 2 billion from Clinton 's request for international affairs funds .
`` These reductions will harm plans to upgrade security and complicate efforts to counter terror , '' she said .
Pakistan rejected the report as unfair , saying terrorism is a global problem .
`` Terrorism is a problem worldwide , one that everyone should be concerned about and one that Pakistan 's chief executive is committed to fight against , '' said Javed Jabbar , a special advisor to Pakistan 's military ruler , Gen. Pervez Musharraf .
A statement issued in the Afghan capital of Kabul by the Taliban foreign ministry dismissed the report as biased .
`` It shows that the United States is ignorant of our history and our religion .
Islam forbids terrorism , '' the statement said .
