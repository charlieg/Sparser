WASHINGTON --
The Clinton administration issued a public warning to Pakistan on Thursday that it could be branded a state sponsor of terrorism -- ending any hope for a resumption of large-scale American aid -- if the Pakistani army continued to support terrorists blamed for the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet last month .
The administration also denounced the decision by Pakistan 's new military leader , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , to require all higher court judges to swear an oath that would bar them from challenging the army .
The country 's chief justice refused to take the pledge earlier this week and was immediately replaced .
The State Department 's chief spokesman , James P. Rubin , said that a possible connection between Pakistan 's military and the group tied to the hijacking , Harkat ul- Mujahedeen , `` is a matter of extreme concern to us -- this is an organization that we have declared a terrorist organization . ''
Asked at a news conference to explain the implications of a link , Rubin said that `` if the secretary of state determines that a government has repeatedly provided support of international terrorism directly , then she would be prepared to designate that country as a state sponsor of terrorism . ''
`` Any country in the world should know that if we determine that they have provided support to international terrorism on a repeated basis , that they are subject to this designation , '' he continued .
The remarks make official what senior administration officials have been saying privately in recent days -- that Pakistan 's ties to the terrorists threaten the already turbulent relationship with the United States , a once close ally , and could produce new American sanctions .
Musharraf took power in a coup last October .
In a meeting last week in Pakistan with a delegation of senior Clinton administration officials , Musharraf refused their request that he ban Harkat ul- Mujahedeen , a radical group seeking independence for Muslims in the disputed Indian state of Kashmir , officials said .
A decision by the United States to add Pakistan to its official list of nations that support terrorism -- a list that includes Iran , Iraq and Syria -- would end any lingering hope in Pakistan for the resumption of what had once been a large package of American aid .
The package , which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the late 1980s , was cut off in 1990 as a result of fears over a Pakistan program to develop nuclear weapons .
The United States now provides Pakistan with only about $ 6 million in aid each year -- half of it for counternarcotics assistance , half of it for health programs for women and children .
Administration officials have also said that the United States could use its leverage in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to cut off loans to Pakistan , although they said the administration would be reluctant to take any move that might push already impoverished Pakistan into near collapse .
American officials said that without some quick move by Pakistan to clamp down on the terrorists or to push for democratic reform , President Clinton will bypass Pakistan during a planned trip to the region at the end of March that is scheduled to include India and Bangladesh .
It will be the first presidential trip to the Indian subcontinent in more than two decades .
