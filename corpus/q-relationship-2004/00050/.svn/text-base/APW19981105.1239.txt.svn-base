BOGOTA , Colombia

A former top Cali cocaine boss was assassinated while watching a soccer game in a prison yard Thursday , two years after he surrendered and began fingering ex-associates .
Helmer `` Pacho '' Herrera was shot at least five times in the face by a man who gained entry to the Palmira prison outside Cali by claiming to be a lawyer for another inmate , officials said .
Herrera , 47 , had been the No. 3 man in the Cali cartel , one of the world 's biggest criminal organizations , and had set up and managed cocaine distribution rings in major U.S. cities , beginning in the 1980s .
The assailant appeared to be `` an acquaintance of Herrera because he greeted him first , '' national police spokesman Carlos Perdomo said .
Herrera died on the way to the hospital , emergency room director Dr. Gustavo Paredes said .
The assassin , identified as Rafael Angel Uribe , 32 , was beaten by other inmates before guards took him away .
He had entered the prison a half hour before the attack , apparently while Herrera was playing in the game 's first half , national prisons director Carmen Lucia Tristancho said .
She said it was unclear whether the murder weapon , a 9mm pistol , was smuggled into the penitentiary or whether it was already inside .
Herrera surrendered to authorities in September 1996 , the last of seven major cartel members to either turn themselves in or be arrested .
He was convicted of drug trafficking in March and sentenced to six years and eight months in prison after incriminating at least 20 former associates .
Herrera continued to seek sentence reductions , fingering his wheelchair-bound half-brother from jail .
But in September , his prison term was increased to 14 years and eight months , following an appeal by prosecutors .
When he surrendered , Herrera said he was tired of being on the run from enemies and thought he would be safer behind bars .
Known as a man with a thousand faces , he had dodged hundreds of police raids , even dressing up as a woman to elude authorities .
A decade ago , Herrera played a key role in the Cali cartel 's secret alliance with the government to wipe out the more violent Medellin drug gang .
His lawyer , Gustavo Salazar , said Thursday the killing could have been related to that rivalry .
Herrera was believed responsible for a 1988 car bomb attack on a building where the family of the late Medellin drug boss Pablo Escobar was living .
The family escaped unhurt .
He survived a September 1990 raid by Medellin cartel hit men on a ranch he owned outside Cali in which 19 people were killed .
In the 1980s , Herrera directed cocaine distribution and money-laundering in the New York City area for the cartel , which at its peak exported about 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States , according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
Gaining a reputation as a deft money-launderer , Herrera had by 1990 established his own family-run cocaine trafficking business and set up and maintained cocaine distribution networks in Los Angeles , Houston and Miami , the DEA says .
The United States made a formal extradition request for Herrera in July 1996 , but Colombian law forbade his extradition .
Herrera is the second leading member of the Cali cartel killed since 1995 , when police captured the organization 's top leaders , Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela .
Both are currently serving jail terms .
Jose Santacruz Londono , another top cartel boss , was killed by police in March 1996 after escaping from prison .
