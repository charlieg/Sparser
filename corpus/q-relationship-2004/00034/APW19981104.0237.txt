The man who helped North Korea strike multimillion-dollar business deals with South Korea has been named to guide the communist state 's policy toward Seoul .
He is Kim Yong Sun , 64 , a close confidant of leader Kim Jong Il and a leading proponent of opening up the isolated North to outside investment , South Korean officials said Wednesday .
He was named chairman of North Korea 's Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland , which is in charge of overall relations with South Korea .
Its top post had been vacant since 1991 .

This month , he successfully negotiated a number of business ventures with Hyundai , South Korea 's largest conglomerate , including a dlrs 906 million tourism project .</ENAMEX>
`` North Korea appears to make Kim the sole contact point for the South and become more consistent in dealing with the South , '' said Kim Young -joon , a Seoul government analyst .
Kim 's new appointment was revealed by Naewoe Press , which is run by South Korea 's intelligence agency and closely monitors North Korean news media .
North Korea rarely makes public its political appointments .
Outside observers watch its news media for clues to any change in the reclusive state 's government lineups .

The sightseeing project would be the largest inter- Korea joint venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North and capitalist South in 1945 .
