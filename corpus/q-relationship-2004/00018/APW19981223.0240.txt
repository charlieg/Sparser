SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
North Korea on Wednesday rejected the American -led U.N. Command 's proposal for border talks to discuss the sinking of a suspected communist spy boat in South Korean waters .
The low-slung , 12-ton North Korean boat went down off South Korea 's south coast Friday in a gun battle with South Korean navy ships .
The command , acting on a South Korean request , proposed to North Korea on Monday that military generals from both sides meet in the truce village of Panmunjom to protest what the Seoul government considered a `` grave military provocation . ''
`` Although obliged to respond favorably to such a proposal by the agreement establishing the general officer talks , the Korean People 's Army today rejected the meeting , '' the command said in a news release Wednesday .
The command said it will continue to press North Korea to live up to its obligations .
South Korea said the craft was on a mission to land spies .
But North Korea accused the South of fabricating the incident .
With the help of the United States , South Korea keeps close watch on the North with camera-equipped satellites and spy planes and communications intercepts .
Lacking such sophisticated tools , North Korea counters by trying to place spies in the South via land and sea routes .
The U.N. Command and the North 's Korean People 's Army signed the 1953 armistice that ended the three-year Korean War , which American -led U.N. forces fought on South Korea 's behalf .
Both sides hold the general officer talks to discuss enforcement and violations of the armistice .
The North Korean boat , believed to be carrying up to eight crewmen , was first spotted as it approached a port on the South 's south coast .
It was pursued for hours by South Korean warships before it was sunk in a gun battle .
The lack of a peace treaty between the two Koreas leaves them technically still in a state of war .
