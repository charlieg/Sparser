SEOUL , South Korea
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
After chasing and then sinking a North Korean speedboat in a gun battle Friday , South Korean navy ships and planes began a sea and air search for the doomed boat 's mother ship .
The body of a North Korean in a wet suit was recovered shortly after the sinking of the vessel , described as a low-slung , high-speed boat used to land or pick up spies .
`` We 're now involved in reconnaissance operations to pursue the mother ship , which is believed to be outside South Korean territorial waters , '' Lt. Gen. Chung Young -jin said .
The office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had earlier described the sunken ship as a mini-submarine of a type commonly used by North Korea for espionage missions .
But Chung , commander of the Joint Chiefs ' Operations Headquarters , told a news conference it was a speedboat capable of carrying up to eight people .
The craft was first spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as it approached Yosu , a small port 320 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- south of Seoul on the tip of the Korean Peninsula , he said .
The boat then fled southeast for about 100 kilometers -LRB- 62 miles -RRB- , pursued for nearly six hours by South Korean navy ships and air force planes , Chung said .
Finally hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped by a South Korean transport plane , the fleeing boat opened fire at the pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire , Chung said .
`` We fired several warning shots , but the enemy craft continued to flee and fired at us .
Therefore , we attacked and sank it , '' said Col. Hwang Dong -kyu , a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman .
About two hours later , South Korean troops recovered the body of the North Korean .
Chung said four men had been sighted on the boat , and Navy frogmen were searching for more bodies .
There were no South Korean casualties .
`` The speedboat is believed to have been dispatched to infiltrate agents into the South , pick up agents stationed in the South , or establish secret , espionage-related drop-off points , '' Chung said .
He said it was believed to have been launched by a mother ship weighing 70 to 100 tons , sailing out of the port of Nampo on North Korea 's west coast .
On shore , South Korean soldiers and police were put on high alert , increasing security checks for possible infiltrators from the boat , officials said .
Chief presidential spokesman Park Jie -won praised the swift military action .
The National Security Council convened later Friday and decided to demand an apology from North Korea and warn of `` stern measures '' against further provocations , Defense Minister Chon Yong -taek said .
`` Probably , the North 's military and other hardliners are trying to raise tension because they fear the South 's policy of reconciliation towards the North may erode their stance within the communist regime , '' Chon told reporters at a news conference .
In Washington , U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley called the intrusion a `` very serious matter . ''
North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up spies along South Korea 's long coastline , officials said .
Several have been detected in recent years .
In June , a 70-ton Yugo -class North Korean submarine was found in South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and periscope tangled in a fishing net .
South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches and found nine bodies , all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact .
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission .
The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site .
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection .
North Korea claims that the facility under construction at Keumjang -ri north of the country 's capital , Pyongyang , is for civilian use , but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related .
North Korea 's military has denounced the U.S. demand for inspection as `` a declaration of war . ''
About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty .
The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945 .
They are still technically at war , because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty .
