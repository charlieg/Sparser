WASHINGTON --
Russia on Tuesday failed to make a $ 362 million payment on Soviet -era debt that it owes to commercial banks around the world , a move that U.S. officials , the International Monetary Fund and lenders to Russia fear could signal a growing movement in Moscow to simply default on the country 's obligations .
The lenders , led by Bank of America , stopped short of calling Tuesday 's action a default , even though it appeared to be exactly that .
In August , in the midst of the devaluation of the ruble and the firing of the economic reformers who had negotiated a bailout of the country with the International Monetary Fund , Russia failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it owed to foreign governments .
But Tuesday 's action was the first in which it failed to pay private creditors , on whom the country 's chances of economic recovery hinge .
Russia needed to reach agreement with 95 percent of its creditors to restructure its debt , essentially allowing it to pay the money back over a far longer period of time .
But only 72 percent of those creditors gave approval to a plan under which the commercial banks would accept government-issued bonds as an alternative to cash .
Russia insists that it only needed to win the approval of two-thirds of the creditors , and therefore it is not technically in default .
`` Officially , the issue of default does not exist at this point , '' Vladimir Yatsenko , an aide to the chairman of Vnesheconombank , Russia 's paying agent , was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg News dispatch from Moscow .
Bank of America said through a spokesman that it was seeking clarification of Yatsenko 's reported statement but that the 95 percent approval requirement from creditors remained unchanged .
The payment itself is not a major problem for the banks , and the markets had long ago anticipated that Russia would find itself unable to pay , or simply would be unwilling to do so .
But the signal that Russia 's action sent seems bound to reverberate in capitals around the world , especially in Washington .
International economic officials said they suspected that Russia had decided to simply default on selected foreign debt .
`` The question , '' said one official who has been engaged in discussions with the Russians , `` is whether this is an act of desperation or a negotiating tactic . ''
One possibility is that the government of President Boris Yeltsin has determined that there is little chance that private banks will lend it money for years to come , even if Russia begins to collect taxes , impose fiscal austerity , and come to terms with the IMF over a new loan package .
With no relationship left to destroy with the commercial banks , this theory goes , the Russians have simply made a determination to halt repayments .
But others believe that the default may simply amount to a negotiating strategy , to force the banks to restructure the debt on Moscow 's terms .
`` This may be their equivalent of an offer we ca n't refuse , '' one banker dealing with Russia said last week .
`` They want us to think that the choice is between getting something -- who knows how much -- someday , or getting nothing at all . ''
The Russians have been engaged in a parallel negotiation with other governments to which it owes money , a group known as the Paris Club .
But that debt cannot be restructured until Russia and the IMF work out a new agreement , to replace the failed accord of last July .
At that time , the IMF agreed to provide Russia with $ 17 billion in additional aid , in return for adherence to a strict agreement with the fund on spending , tax collection and social programs .
That agreement was essentially shattered in August , after Russia received a little more than $ 4 billion in aid .
The IMF has cut off further payments , and the assumption in Washington is that any future agreement with the fund will be smaller and more `` backloaded , '' meaning that Russia would have to meet many of the conditions of the new loan before much cash is forwarded to Moscow .
Tuesday 's failure to meet the payment schedule came as the Clinton administration announced that the secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , would visit Russia from Jan. 25 through Jan. 27 , to launch long-delayed strategic arms reduction talks and to try to patch over differences on how to deal with Iraq .
But it is unclear how the United States and Russia can begin arms talks over Start III when the Duma , Russia 's Parliament , has refused to ratify Start II .
The arms talks and Russia 's economic troubles are closely linked .
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has pledged to win approval on Start II , which was signed in 1993 , in part because he wants to save the money required to maintain and upgrade a large nuclear fleet .
But it is unclear whether Albright will deal at any length with Russia 's crushing financial problems .
