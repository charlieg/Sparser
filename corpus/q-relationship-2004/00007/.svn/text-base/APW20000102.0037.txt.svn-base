WASHINGTON
-LRB- AP -RRB- -- Almost imperceptibly , the Clinton administration has put together a string of foreign policy advances , a trend reassuring to officials with memories of what was a decidedly grim international picture just a few months ago .
As a new year begins , officials are highlighting a modest revival of U.S. - Chinese relations following a long period in the deep freeze .
Prospects for peace in the Mideast have brightened and there have been long strides toward a permanent settlement in Northern Ireland .
The situation in Kosovo has stabilized .
And a sore point with much of the rest of the world -- the United States ' skipping out on its dues owed the United Nations -- has been partially put to rest .
For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , officials say there was no moment more discouraging than the lonely , late night trek she made to the Chinese Embassy last May 7 to apologize to Ambassador Li Zhao Xing for the accidental NATO bombing of Beijing 's Embassy in Yugoslavia .
Besides the three Chinese who were killed and the many injured , another casualty was U.S. - Chinese relations , which the United States had been assiduously nurturing .
After the bombing , ties with Beijing went into a deep freeze for months .
It was a difficult time for President Clinton and his foreign policy team and not only because of the problems with China .
Israelis and Palestinians were not implementing the U.S. -brokered Wye River agreement they had reached in October 1998 .
Perceived military posturing by North Korea was generating anxiety in Northeast Asia .
And there were grave doubts about whether NATO 's air war over Yugoslavia would produce a positive outcome .
Now , almost eight months later , grounds for hope exist .
Some reasons : --U.S.-Chinese relations have revived somewhat after their mid-year chill .
The two countries were able to reach a trade agreement this past fall that will enable China to join the World Trade Organization , which sets rules for international commerce .
--With the help of almost 50,000 mostly- European forces , the situation in Kosovo has stabilized for the time being .
NATO 's air war over Yugoslavia proved far more effective in bringing Yugoslavia to heel than skeptics had believed .
All Kosovo Albanians who were evicted from the province by Yugoslav forces have returned .
But the goal of ethnic harmony between the Albanians and Serbs seems far off .
--With a nudge from U.S. diplomacy , Israeli and Syrian leaders have resumed peace talks for the first time in almost four years .
A crucial new round of discussions begins on Monday in West Virginia .
Meanwhile , the tone of Israeli - Palestinian relations has improved markedly but progress on substance remains difficult .
--North Korea has bowed to U.S. insistence that it not go ahead with a test of a long-range missile .
The prospect of a new test on the heels of one in 1998 had been causing alarm in much of Northeast Asia .
Officials caution , however , that it is too early to declare victory in their bid to wean Pyongyang on to a peaceful path .
--With an assist from the United States , a new Protestant - Catholic government has taken power in Northern Ireland , where war has flared intermittently for 30 years .
Resistance to disarmament by paramilitaries remains a potential obstacle to a lasting peace .
--An enormous headache for the administration was eased when Congress voted in December to pay $ 926 million in U.N. arrears over three years .
U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke called the vote a `` terrain-changing event . ''
`` The Clinton administration has made a lot of progress in foreign policy , '' says Lee Hamilton , a former Democratic chairman of the House International Relations Committee who now heads the Wilson Center , a research group .
`` The big relationships are heading in the right direction , '' he says , citing U.S. ties with Japan and the European Union .
One question mark among analysts , however , is the future of U.S. - Russian relations now that Boris Yeltsin has stepped down as president .
Helmut Sonnenfeldt of the Brookings Institution is n't sure the positive trend of recent months means very much .
`` We have a whole host of things that in some respects are better .
Whether they are fundamentally better you ca n't tell , '' he says .
John Bolton , a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State James A. Baker , believes 2000 will be fraught with dangers .
`` The past year has been a year of things that did n't happen , '' Bolton says .
There could be military tensions with China , he says , at the time of Taiwan 's presidential elections in March , much as there were when the last such elections were held , in 1996 .
Also , Bolton also is concerned that Iraq may be developing weapons of mass destruction with impunity now that more than a year has passed since President Saddam Hussein forced U.N. weapons inspectors out .
A U.N. Security Council resolution approved last month authorizes a new weapons inspection system but Iraq says it wo n't cooperate .
For Saddam , the downside of this stance is that U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq , now almost nine years old , will remain in place .
State Department spokesman James Foley says Iraq is increasingly isolated in the Middle East .
Citing the progress Israel and its neighbors have been making , Foley says , `` The forces of peace are back in the ascendance .
It is not a regional context that is beneficial to Saddam . ''
Hamilton also finds Iraq a worrisome problem but says the United States must also deal with a larger issue , one that relates to the preeminent place of the United States as a global military and economic power .
`` How do we use it for good and for the achievement of American and national interests ? '' he asks .
That 's the great challenge in foreign policy as we move into the year ahead . ''
