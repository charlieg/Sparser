GENEVA
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
For decades Switzerland has been a residence of choice for the world 's richest people , offering privacy , a bit of skiing and not too much of a tax burden on the good old numbered bank account .
The trial of Russian businessman Sergei Mikhailov , starting Monday , is the first major Swiss attempt to draw the line against Russians who obtained their wealth through organized crime .
Russians who made their money in the heady post- Communist years have flocked to buy villas on the so-called Swiss Riviera of Lake Geneva around Montreux and to secure their fortunes in Swiss banks .
Swiss officials say they do n't have a breakdown of the Russians who have come to Switzerland since the fall of communism , but that they issued residence permits to 5,695 former Soviets by the end of 1996 , more than double the figure for 1991 , when the Soviet Union collapsed .
Among the new residents , according to Jean Ziegler , an outspoken critic of the Swiss establishment , are top figures in the increasingly powerful Russian mafia .
`` There are three stages of Russian mafia penetration , '' Ziegler , a university professor and member of parliament , told The Associated Press .
`` When the Soviet Union broke up , Switzerland was the laundering place for immense fortunes .
Then mafia leaders started sending their families to Switzerland , putting their children in expensive private schools .
`` Now we are in the third stage where some of the mafia dons are transferring their operational headquarters to Switzerland -- and that is deadly dangerous , '' Ziegler says .
Geneva prosecutors say Mikhailov is head of the Moscow -based Solntsevskaya crime organization , linked to the worldwide network of the mafia godfather Vyacheslav Ivankov -- known as Yaponchik -- who was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in New York last year .
Geneva prosecutors arrested Mikhailov more than two years ago on charges of money laundering and membership in a criminal organization , as well as violations of the strict Swiss property laws .
The money-laundering charges , however , have been dropped because of the difficulty of obtaining evidence from Russia , Geneva officials said .
Mikhailov maintains that he is an ordinary businessmen , though he admits to being `` very , very , very rich . ''
Mikhailov faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in prison .
While the 40-year -old has been held since his arrest in the prison of Champ - Dollon in Geneva , Swiss officials say that has done little to curb his activities .
In March his Swiss lawyer was arrested after he was caught leaving the prison with letters from Mikhailov which had not passed through the censor .
Although ostensibly letters to Mikhailov 's mistress , they are , Geneva authorities claim , just one of the many ways in which Mikhailov has continued to run his organization from his prison cell .
The prosecution 's main witness is former Moscow police officer Nikolai Oporov .
He resigned from his job and received political exile in Switzerland following threats to his life and is now under heavy guard pending the trial .
Another probable prosecution witness , Vadim Rozenbaum , who was due to be interviewed by the investigating judge , will not be giving evidence -- he was assassinated in the Netherlands in July 1997 .
No one has ever been charged in the case .
Rozenbaum headed a Soviet cooperative in the late 1980s , and Mikhailov spent 19 months in detention at the time on charges of extorting money from him , but the charges were dropped for lack of evidence .
While Oporov is the only Russian enlisted for the prosecution , lawyers for Mikhailov are expected to call up to 25 Russians .
A total of 90 witnesses have been called , so the trial is expected to last two weeks , longer than the usual three or four days typical in Switzerland .
Ziegler says whatever the outcome of the Mikhailov trial , the only way to make a dent in the Russian mafia is to make sweeping changes to the banking system .
`` Switzerland should n't allow the opening of Russian banks here , as more than 70 per cent are in the hands of the mafia , and we should be much more careful with residence permits , '' Ziegler said .
