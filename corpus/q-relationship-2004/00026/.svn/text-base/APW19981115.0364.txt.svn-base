Russia 's Mir space station will stay in orbit until the end of 1999 or the start of 2000 , and possibly longer , an official said Sunday .
Earlier government estimates said the aging Mir , which has been in orbit for more than ten years , would be decommissioned in the middle of next year .
Russian space officials insist it could stay up for another two years .
Presidential aide Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said Mir 's life expectancy depends on scheduling for the launch of a Russian service module for an international space station project , set for mid-summer , 1999 .
Mir would stay in orbit for a few months after .
The United States and other countries want Russia to dedicate all its resources to the International Space Station , which has been delayed by funding shortages on the Russian side .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">NASA is paying the Russian Space Agency up to $ 60 million to make sure it completes a service module , scheduled for launch in the middle of next year , on time .</ENAMEX>
Astronauts and cosmonauts cannot live on the space station until the service module and its life-support systems are in orbit .
It costs Russia about 225 million rubles -LRB- dlrs 13.6 million -RRB- each year to keep the Mir in orbit .
But Russia 's sentimental attachment to the Mir has made it tough to let go of the accident-prone station .
Meanwhile , Sunday was the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Buran spaceship , one of the last efforts in the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States .
Russia sunk millions of rubles -LRB- millions of dollars -RRB- in the Buran ships , modeled after U.S. space shuttles .
An unmanned Buran circled the earth twice in a test flight in 1988 , but the project was scrapped without any further launches because of lack of funds .
