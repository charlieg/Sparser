MOSCOW
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
The Russian parliament urged President Boris Yeltsin on Friday to reconsider the government 's plan to discard the Mir space station next year , saying that would finish Russia as a space power .
Parliament 's lower house , the State Duma , demanded that the government keep Mir in orbit until a new international space station becomes operational .
The Russian Space Agency had initially planned to keep a crew on Mir until the end of 1999 , but decided to abandon it next June because of a severe shortage of funds .
`` The decision to discard Mir causes bewilderment and protests of scientists and experts throughout the world , '' a statement by the Duma said .
Lawmakers said up to 100,000 Russian space workers would be left without jobs if Mir is discarded , fomenting unrest and destroying high-tech industries that could be a base for economic growth .
