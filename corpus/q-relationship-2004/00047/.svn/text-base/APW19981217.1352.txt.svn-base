MADRID , Spain
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Major oil producers Saudi Arabia , Mexico and Venezuela agreed Thursday to maintain reduced output through 1999 and to seek cuts by other oil producers in order to bring down supplies and improve sagging prices .
Ministers of oil and energy from the three nations said after a meeting in the Spanish capital that they `` urge other producing countries to strictly comply with their commitments . ''
The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from other countries .
All were searching for a so-far elusive answer to the question of how to bring the price of oil higher .
Crude prices , depressed by overproduction amid a global economic crisis , have hovered this year around 12-year lows , costing oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue .
The statement said Saudi Arabia , Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed their commitment to the agreed reductions in June 1998 , 725,000 barrels a day and 200,000 barrels a day respectively .
The Saudis and the Mexicans have already announced their decisions to extend reduction agreements until the end of next year , the statement added .
`` Venezuela , sharing the same spirit and resolution , will immediately undertake decisions required to extend its production restrictions until December 1999 , '' the three ministers said in the joint statement .
Venezuela had agreed to reductions of 525,000 barrels a day .
Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Mexico have led an initiative to cut production this year which led to an agreement at the end of June by OPEC , excluding Iraq , and non- OPEC members to cut production by a total of 3.1 million barrels a day for a period of one year starting July 1 .
Analysts and some OPEC members have said another additional 1.5 million barrels must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices .
The officials from the three nations also agreed to `` initiate immediate actions to discuss with other producers further measures that translate into a large stock draw-down and improvement of oil prices . ''
The statement said consultations will be carried out with other oil-producing countries and that `` visits had been arranged for the very near future . ''
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was expected to fly to Norway after the Madrid meeting .

A senior Saudi source , speaking on condition he is not identified further , said Saudi Arabia will consult with OPEC colleagues while Mexico and Venezuela will initiate talks with oil producers in their region , such as Colombia and Ecuador .
Saudi Arabia is the leading producer among the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , with output at about 8 million barrels per day .
Venezuela is OPEC 's No. 3 exporter Venezuela , producing about 2.8 million barrels a day .
Mexico , which is not a member of the organization , produces 3.2 million barrels a day .
The slide in oil prices has continued despite repeated attempts earlier this year at production cuts , including those implemented by some OPEC members .
The price of Brent crude has traded at around dlrs 10 a barrel .
A Gulf source close to the Saudis said earlier Thursday that the oil-rich kingdom would like to see a price target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20 .
