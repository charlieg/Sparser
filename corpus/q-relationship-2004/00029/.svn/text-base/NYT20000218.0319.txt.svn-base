U.S. officials investigating a decade of international terrorist attacks say they have found a common thread -- Islamic charities and relief organizations that they suspect are being used to move men , money and weapons across borders .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">U.S. officials said Osama bin Laden , the Saudi exile charged with masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in East Africa , relied on at least nine of the groups in his recent operations</ENAMEX> .
Other charities and relief groups , the officials said , have been linked to a recent plot to bomb historic and tourist sites in Jordan , the 1993 bombing of New York City 's World Trade Center and terrorist attacks in Egypt against tourists and government officials .
`` These charities and relief groups are a crucial part of terrorism 's infrastructure , '' said one official who monitors terrorism closely .
`` Money people give for worthy causes should not wind up buying explosives or phony passports .
But we still know too little about how Islamic fundamentalists use and abuse these groups . ''
Most of the 6,000 Islamic groups operating worldwide are considered legitimate and provide emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places with the support of friendly states .
In addition , the officials said , the charities are often unaware that terrorists have used them as cover .
`` Most of these groups do some good works in some places , '' one official said .
`` And often , only a few officials or a single chapter involving a small part of the charity 's leadership or resources is being used . ''
Although the Clinton administration has previously investigated alleged links between individual Islamic charities and specific terrorist groups , this is the first time that it is scrutinizing a block of such groups to determine whether they are being used , wittingly or not , by Islamic terrorist networks .
As such , officials said , the inquiry is a major expansion of the government 's counterterrorism efforts .
Israel has been pressing the United States for years to spearhead an international crackdown on Islamic charities and private relief groups .
But officials said Washington had been reluctant to interfere in a domain safeguarded by constitutional guarantees of free association and separation of church and state .
In addition , officials said , they lacked evidence that could be used in public court proceedings .
In recent months , U.S. officials have circulated within the government a list of more than 30 groups that they are examining for links to terrorism , at least two of which are based in the United States .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- In January , a team of officials led by the Treasury Department visited Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain and other Arab states to discuss specific charities with their Middle Eastern counterparts .
In Canada , officials said they planned to seek new legal authority to confiscate the assets of charities that acted as fronts for terrorism .
This measure , the officials said , is part of a broad anti-terrorism package that the government will soon propose to Parliament .
Canada cut off government financing in 1997 to Human Concern International , a Canadian -based group , for what official documents call the group 's `` terrorist connections . ''
That group is also being investigated by the United States , said U.S. and Canadian officials .
The director of the charity , Kaleem Akhtar , denied that his group had terrorist links and said it was `` totally wrong '' to defame groups that did such good work .
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- U.S. officials said their investigations into the role of such Islamic charities and relief groups had been prompted by recent terrorist attacks and plots .
The officials acknowledged that the scrutiny was politically and diplomatically sensitive .
U.S. officials said charities could provide excellent cover for terrorist groups , because relief workers are welcomed almost everywhere and their shipments of supplies are rarely checked by border guards or the police .
-LRB- BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- Discovering the origins and supporters of such charities may be difficult , investigators said .
While the United States , Canada and several European states require tax-exempt charities to file at least annual reports listing their assets , expenditures and officers , many states , including several in the Middle East , do not .
-LRB- END OPTIONAL TRIM -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">One instance in which investigators said they believed that the role of charities was crucial was the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , crimes that killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands .
Prosecutors said material seized from the Nairobi office of the Mercy International Relief Agency includes records of calls to the cellular telephone of bin Laden</ENAMEX> .
Another document found at the office , dated two weeks before the bombings , refers to `` getting the weapons from Somalia . ''
Mercy , based in Ireland , was one of five private associations that Kenya closed weeks after the bombing .
The government said those groups had `` deviated from development objectives '' and `` posed a serious threat '' to Kenya 's security .
In recent days , officials disclosed that a roommate of one the men charged with plotting to bomb targets in the United States had worked for Mercy in Dublin .
The State Department stepped up its efforts to investigate the charities late last year , after officials involved in counterterrorism work found that the United States government had inadvertently helped support questionable charities .
The State Department had included a charity that counterterrorism officials say has ties to Sudan 's governing Islamic party on a list of 50 groups through which Americans could aid refugees in Kosovo .
The State Department has identified Sudan as a sponsor of terrorism .
The charity , the Islamic African Relief Agency , also received two grants in 1998 worth $ 4.2 million for work in Mali from the State Department 's Agency for International Development .
The grants to the charity , which is one of the 30 being scrutinized , were cut off in December at the State Department 's request on grounds that they were not in America 's `` national security interests , '' an AID official said .
The organization 's president said he was appealing the decision .
Speaking from Columbia , Mo. , where the charity has been registered since 1984 , its director , Ahmed Mubarak , said his group had `` nothing to do with Sudan '' and that Washington had never accused it of any terrorist-related activity .
`` We are simply trying to help people wherever they need help , Mubarak said . ''
The list of more than 30 groups with suspected ties to terrorists includes two based in the United States , the Global Relief Foundation Inc. and the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development , based in Richardson , Texas .
U.S. officials have been looking into Holy Land since the mid-1990s .
Some government officials recommended that the group be prosecuted in 1997 for supporting Hamas , the militant Islamic group .
But others opposed the effort , fearing that it would expose intelligence sources and spur public criticism of the administration as anti- Muslim .
The inquiry appears to have been revived .
Responding recently to a lawsuit by Steven Emerson , a journalist who follows militant Islamic groups , the State Department said it could not make documents about Holy Land public because the group was the subject of `` an ongoing law-enforcement proceeding . ''
A lawyer for the group , Donya C. Witherspoon , said Holy Land had no involvement with terrorism and had been very careful that its donations cannot be used by terrorist groups .
`` Their whole purpose and emphasis is anti-terrorist , '' Witherspoon said .
Contending that it was a front for Hamas , Israel closed the charity and four others in May 1997 .
An Israeli official said the government had provided `` thousands of pages of information '' about the group to American officials , urging them and other Western governments to close it .
A lawyer for Global Relief , Stanley Cohen , called the investigation of that foundation a `` scurrilous attack '' and `` another of the government 's pathetic attempts to sully committed Islamic organizations . ''
Reports filed for 1998 , the most recent available , said Global Relief , of Bridgeview , Ill. , had an income of $ 1.7 million and distributed `` food , clothing , relief supplies '' to refugees , flood victims and orphans .
