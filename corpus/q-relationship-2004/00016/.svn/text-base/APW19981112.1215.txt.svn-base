BAGHDAD , Iraq
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Facing a U.S. military buildup and harsh criticism from fellow Arabs , Iraq on Thursday blamed Washington for the deepening crisis over U.N. arms inspections and said an American attack would be `` a sheer aggression of criminals . ''
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz -- his voice rising in anger -- charged that President Bill Clinton was blocking the completion of arms inspections necessary for the lifting of punishing trade sanctions on Iraq .
`` The road is being blocked continuously , stubbornly , illegally by his government , '' Aziz told a news conference that came shortly after eight Arab states said Iraq itself would be at fault if the U.S. military struck at the country .
The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Iraq 's vulnerable neighbors -- along with Syria and Egypt was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis .
Foreign ministers of the eight states , meeting in the Gulf state of Qatar , did urge `` wisdom and reason '' to end the confrontation .
But they said the government of President Saddam Hussein would be `` responsible for any consequences '' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons inspectors .
Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs to renew cooperation with the United Nations or face more suffering by the Iraqi people .
`` If they are sincere in dealing with this situation ... they should blame the main block , the main government which is behind this crisis .
They should criticize the United States , '' he said .
Iraq 's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the United States was preparing to make good on its military threats unless searches for Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction are renewed .
The United States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to the Gulf to ready for an attack , and the United Nations -- declaring it must look to the safety of its workers -- pulled 21 more of its staff out of Iraq on Thursday .
The U.N. pullback began Wednesday .
All arms inspectors and a third of the 450 U.N. humanitarian workers have now left the country , with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the effectiveness of programs to help Iraq 's 22 million people .
At his news conference , Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate with arms inspectors , but only if it had guarantees from the U.N. Security Council that this would lead to lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a U.N. offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections -- as one step toward lifting the sanctions -- by refusing to include even a reference to the eight-year -old trade embargo .
The sanctions , which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its economy , cannot be be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed its lethal weapons .
This was required under the cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait .
Aziz complained that after more than seven years of working with U.N. inspectors , `` sanctions were not reduced and were not lifted . ''
`` Why ? '' he asked rhetorically .
`` Because the government of Mr. Clinton has blocked any attempt during this period to reduce and lift sanctions .
He and his government are the problem , not Iraq . ''
Aziz questioned whether the United States had the right to attack .
`` Is that in the U.N. resolutions ? '' he asked .
`` Is that international law ?
Is that a ... a humanitarian mission to be conducted by a government ?
Or is it a sheer aggression of criminals ? ''
He also said Iraq 's people were not worried about a possible military strike .
`` They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and equipment or they die by American bombs , '' he said .
`` For the Iraqi people it makes no difference . ''
Aziz said that U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan was `` the best person '' to try to ease the current crisis , as he did the last one in February with a pledge to work toward an end to the sanctions .
The United States had built up forces in the Gulf in February , too , but that stand-off ended when Iraq backed down from its insistence that U.N. experts could not inspect Saddam 's presidential palaces .
In August , seeing no signs of the sanctions being lifted , Iraq again limited the work of arms inspectors and on Oct. 31 it cut off even the long-term monitoring intended to prevent the Iraqi government from renewing weapons production .
That brought a Security Council condemnation and a renewal of U.S. threats of a military strike .
Britain has backed Washington in the Security Council , and Iraq 's usual allies -- China , France and Russia -- have not been outspoken in defending the Iraqi government .
