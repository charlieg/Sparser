<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">John Hume and David Trimble , the leaders of Northern Ireland 's two main political parties , on Friday won the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence that plagued the British province for three decades</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Hume , 61 , head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party , and Trimble , 54 , leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward ending `` the national religious and social conflict in Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives . ''</ENAMEX>
Their work culminated in a peace agreement that was concluded and ratified this spring .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland 's political leaders in his work for a peaceful solution</ENAMEX> , '' the committee said in its citation .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern Ireland , David Trimble showed great political courage when , at a critical stage in the process , he advocated solutions which led to the peace agreement</ENAMEX> , '' the citation said .
It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage peace in Northern Ireland .
The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in founding the International Peace People group , which later fizzled .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Both Hume and Trimble , who have a frosty personal relationship , said the prize was not meant for them as individuals , but for the concept of peace in Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
`` Well as you would expect , I am very deeply honored to have received this award today , but I see it not as an award for myself but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland , '' Hume said .
Trimble , in Denver on a trip to promote investment in Northern Ireland , called the award `` a great honor , but it 's not for me personally and I think people should n't look at it in that light . ''
He said it belonged to the people of Ireland `` who have longed so much for real peace to come . ''
`` And I hope very much that this award does n't turn out to be premature , because there is still work to be done to secure peace in Northern Ireland , '' Trimble said before rushing off to a meeting of potential investors .
In a news conference in New York , Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army , disagreed with Trimble 's cautious statement .
`` The only question at this time about the process moving ahead comes from the Ulster Unionist Party .
It 's entirely within Mr. Trimble 's gift as a leader of his party to ensure that this is not premature , '' he said .
In the days leading up to prize , the Norwegian news media largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also include Adams .
At his news conference , Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of the IRA 's terrorist history .
He refused to discuss the deliberations of the committee .
`` We do n't shy away from anyone .
We just try to find the most appropriate laureates , '' Sejersted said .
`` I can only repeat that many people have contributed to this process , not in the least Gerry Adams . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor -LRB- dlrs 963,000 -RRB- will be divided equally between Hume and Trimble</ENAMEX> .
Hume 's diplomacy has been credited with providing a major boost to the peace process .
It was Hume who envisioned the broad agenda for the discussions , arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the British and Irish governments , be overseen by neutral figures , and their results be ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland .
Hume began the thaw in Belfast 's frigid political landscape in 1993 by courting Adams in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">Trimble would have been viewed as a peacebreaker more than a peacemaker three years ago .
He was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 after championing the rights of Protestants and has since battled to keep control of his party -- and his party at the talks table</ENAMEX> .
He refused to talk directly to Adams during the eight months Sinn Fein was at the same table , knowing to do so would risk political suicide .
But he took on more than many observers thought he could manage in April 's agreement , watching key aides abandon him as he accepted a deal that would allow imprisoned IRA members go free without ironclad assurances that the outlawed group would disarm .
Sejersted said the committee knows there is a risk of setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords were concluded in April .
But `` it indicates that the process is going in on the right track , and that there is reason for optimism , '' the chairman said .
`` We wanted to give it a push . ''
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern , both mentioned as possible winners of this year 's peace prize , immediately praised the decision .
`` There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize than David Trimble and John Hume , '' said Blair in London .
`` This is a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership . ''
Ahern called it `` a deserved tribute to two of the principal architects '' of the peace agreement .
The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named this year .
The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen , an Indian scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and other catastrophes .
On Tuesday , Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University , Horst L. Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than particles .
The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical reactions .
On Monday , the medicine prize was given to three Americans -- Robert Furchgott , Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad -- for their work on discovering properties of nitric oxide , a common air pollutant but also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels .
The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago .
Last year 's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jody Williams of the United States and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines for their efforts to ban antipersonnel mines because they kill more civilians than soldiers .
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10 , the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel , the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes in his will .
