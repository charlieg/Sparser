DENVER --
Shortly before sunup in Denver Friday , one of the new Nobel Peace Prize winners , David Trimble , held an impromptu news conference outside the Brown Palace Hotel as he hurried to meetings with business leaders on the final day of a trade mission here .
Trimble told a few reporters that the award was a great honor , and one that he hoped foretold a true peace .
`` I 'm quite sure that we 've crossed a watershed this year , and I do n't think there 'll be any going back , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble , 54 </ENAMEX>.
`` There 's still some difficulties on the road , some obstacles to negotiate , but I think we will manage to do that and this award may help that . ''
Trimble was asleep at 3 a.m. when the awards were announced , and members of his staff fielded calls from around the world until they woke him with the news two hours later .
He was greeted by the glare of local TV news camera lights and microphones as he left his hotel .
Although he was given a standing ovation at his scheduled breakfast meeting with about 100 business and civic leaders , the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party , the main Protestant party , steered talk back to the business at hand .
`` Thank you , thank you , but we 've got some business to do , '' he told the crowd .
<ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Trimble is a member of a delegation touring 11 U.S. cities in three weeks in an effort to interest companies to do business in Northern Ireland</ENAMEX> .
The real prize will be lasting peace for his country and prosperity to go with it , he told reporters .
`` The honor is for all those who worked so hard in the peace process , and the honor is for the people of Northern Ireland who endorsed that process and who have longed for peace for so long , '' he said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">As for sharing the honor with John Hume , leader of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party</ENAMEX> , Trimble said he thought it was `` appropriate . ''
`` I feel quite happy to share the award with John , '' he said with a laugh .
`` I think by honoring both our parties the committee has been very wise . ''
