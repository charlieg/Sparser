The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it hoped a new fishing agreement with Japan will lead to cooperation in other areas .
The agreement , which took effect Thursday , allows Japan to fish off the southern Kuril Islands , which are claimed by both countries .
`` The history of Russian - Japanese ties indicates that relations in the field of fishing have traditionally served as an indicator of trust between the two countries , '' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
`` This agreement is the result of new favorable tendencies aimed at strengthening good-neighborliness and partnership between Russia and Japan , '' the statement said .
The conflicting claims over the Kuril Islands , seized by the Soviet army at the end of World War II , have prevented Russia and Japan from signing a formal peace treaty ending the war .
