The agreement comes at a time of thawing relations between Russia and Japan , whose leaders are trying to resolve a half-century -old dispute over the Kuril Islands , part of the Sakhalin region just north of Hokkaido .
`` This is a remarkable event which is of great importance not only for the two country 's neighboring regions , but for other territories as well , '' Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov said at a signing ceremony , the Interfax news agency reported .
Farkhutdinov said that the implementation of offshore oil and gas projects in Sakhalin was a priority in establishing the cooperation pact with Hokkaido .
`` The main problem facing the Kuril Islands is the energy problem , '' he said .
Gov. Tatsuya Hori of Hokkaido said , `` stronger good-neighborly ties between our territories will promote bilateral relations between Russia and Japan at the turn of the century . ''
The agreement made no mention of the dispute over the Kurils , which Russia claimed after World War II .
Japan has consistently maintained that the seizure was illegal .
