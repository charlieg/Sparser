Japan 's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura focused on a World War II peace treaty with Russia during talks in Moscow on Saturday , a document the two countries never signed because of a territorial dispute .
Komura met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and later Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .
Talks were also scheduled with First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov , in charge of economic ties with Japan , and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , a likely candidate in Russia 's next presidential elections .
The peace treaty hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril Islands , seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off Russia 's Pacific coast .
President Boris Yeltsin has promised a treaty will be signed by 2000 .
At the start of his meeting with Komura , Primakov said Russia `` will stand firm by the positions laid out by Yeltsin and ex- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto , '' the Interfax news agency reported .
Diplomatic efforts in preparation for Komura 's visit `` will allow us to come closer to a peace treaty , '' Primakov said .
There have been no signs of progress on resolving the Kurils disagreement , despite an overall improvement in relations .
Moscow insists a decision on the Kurils must not threaten its national interests .
Japan has been cautious about investment and economic cooperation with Russia -- key areas that Komura 's talks Saturday were expected to discuss -- because of lack of movement in the dispute .
Still , in an interview published Friday , Komura said Russian - Japanese relations have warmed because of summits between Yeltsin and Hashimoto .
