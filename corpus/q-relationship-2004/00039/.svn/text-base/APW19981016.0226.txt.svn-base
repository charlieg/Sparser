Japan 's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will spend the weekend working toward a World War II peace treaty with Russia , which the two countries have never signed .
President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be signed by 2000 , although it hinges on solving a dispute over the Kuril Islands , seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off Russia 's Pacific coast .
There have been no signs of progress on resolving the disagreement on the Kuril Islands despite the overall improvement in relations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="VITAL">In an interview published Friday , Komura said Russian - Japanese relations have made progress due to summits between Russia 's President Boris Yeltsin and Japan 's former- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto .
`` In Russian - Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous dialogue on a high level , '' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta .</ENAMEX>
Komura , who was to arrive in Moscow on Friday night , is expected to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov , Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and other top officials , the Interfax news agency reported .
The visit comes one day after Russia 's parliament voted to reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World War II .
The holiday had been dropped after the Soviet collapse .
The upper chamber of parliament , the Federation Council , agreed to reestablish the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan , which marks the Soviet Union 's defeat of Japan on Sept. 3 , 1945 , the ITAR - Tass news agency reported .
The measure , which has already been approved by the lower house , requires President Boris Yeltsin 's signature to become law .
