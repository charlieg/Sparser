NEW YORK , August 22 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- <ENAMEX TYPE="OKAY">Chemical evidence found from the wreckage of the TWA Flight 800 led investigators to believe that an explosive device was detonated to cause the crash , The New York Times reported in its early Friday edition .
Chemists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation -LRB- FBI -RRB- crime laboratory have found traces of PETN , a chemical component in plastic explosives , on a piece of wreckage retrieved from the jet 's passenger cabin between rows 17 and 27 , the newspaper said .</ENAMEX>
The finding provides evidence that the jetliner was destroyed by an explosive device , but the Times said the chemical is commonly found in many bombs and surface-to-air missiles , making it impossible to know which type of device was involved in the July 17 crash that killed all 230 people aboard .
The Times said senior investigators were not yet ready to declare the crash the result of a criminal act .
`` Whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at this point we do n't know for sure , '' according to a source close to the investigation .
If the crash is declared a criminal act , it will be the deadliest crime in American history , surpassing the April 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people .
The investigators still hoped to retrieve more wreckage and were particularly interested in finding metal fragments showing what investigators call shock waves which are the physical damage left by a blast that suggests what type of device exploded .
Five days after the crash , investigators found preliminary indications of PETN residue on a piece of the right wing near the fuselage , but that was not confirmed by a later test at the FBI lab in Washington .
In another development , U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration investigators who probed the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986 were called in Thursday to examine specific pieces of TWA Flight 800 's wreckage .
