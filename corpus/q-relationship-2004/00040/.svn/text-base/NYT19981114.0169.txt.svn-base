For more than two decades , the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery has been one of the most hotly debated fisheries in the world .
As the annual meeting of the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas begins Sunday in Santiago de Compostela , Spain , contention is rising over such issues as quota reductions and a lack of compliance with existing agreements .
According to United States delegates , American fishermen are shouldering the brunt of the conservation effort , while European nations are cashing in on the Atlantic bluefin fishery .
Since the 1960s , Japan has offered U.S. commercial fishermen a strong market for giant bluefin .
In the past , prices for high-quality tuna , which have averaged about 400 pounds when landed in U.S. waters , have sometimes topped $ 63 a pound .
Single fish , which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds , are reported to have fetched $ 30,000 on the dock and been resold for $ 80,000 in Japan , where 90 percent of the world 's bluefin catch is consumed .
With many fisheries in decline , the influx of cash from bluefin sales has helped keep many economies -- personal and national -- healthy over the last decade .
Percy Stevens fishes commercially for giant bluefin tuna in the harpoon category , one of five management categories established by the National Marine Fisheries Service for the allocation of the U.S. quota .
He runs his 35-foot Heidi Marie out of Ogunquit , Maine .
Rigged with a mast for the spotter and a long platform off the bow , the `` pulpit '' for the harpooner , Stevens ' boat is typical of those in the harpoon fleet .
Stevens has been fishing for tuna all his life .
`` I went with my father when I was a kid , then in 1979 I went with a fellow named Timmy Tower , '' he said .
`` He put me onto a big one and I threw -- my first fish -- and I got him .
I was hooked . ''
Like Stevens , Jimmy Donofrio , executive director of the New Jersey -based Recreational Fishermen 's Alliance , is passionate about this fishery .
`` The fishery for small bluefin in the mid- Atlantic states goes back to the days of sail , '' Donofrio said .
`` Around the turn of the century , they used to troll for bluefin with catboats and land between 15,000 and 20,000 tons in a season .
`` We 're not looking for that kind of quota today , but people have a longstanding right to fish for recreation and subsistence , '' Donofrio said .
`` All we want is a reasonable bag limit .
We consider four fish per vessel reasonable .
A catch-and-release fishery is not going to satisfy us . ''
In a controversial decision , the National Marine Fisheries Service listed bluefin tuna as `` overfished '' and , in response to a congressional stock-rebuilding mandate , may call for a U.S. reduction of up to 77 percent .
The issues affecting domestic management of bluefin range far beyond U.S. waters .
Bluefin can swim at up to 55 mph and their trans- Atlantic crossings have been well documented .
Originally managed as one stock , since 1981 Atlantic bluefin tuna have been considered by the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas , known as ICCAT , as two separate stocks : one in the East , with its spawning grounds in the Mediterranean Sea , and one in the West , thought to spawn exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico .
For management purposes the two stocks are divided by an arbitrary line drawn down the middle of the Atlantic along the 45th meridian .
ICCAT currently assumes there is only minimal -LRB- 3 percent -RRB- mixing between Eastern and Western fish .
Because of this separate-management scenario , known as the Two - Stock Theory , countries in the East have been landing record catches -- more than 40,000 metric tons in four of the last five years -- while the United States , Canada and Japan share a Western quota of 2,354 metric tons .
American fishermen get 1,344 metric tons , 3 percent of the total Atlantic catch .
`` The Two - Stock Theory was a political decision , '' said Dick Stone , formerly a fisheries service scientist and now science adviser to the Recreational Fisherman 's Alliance .
`` We could n't get the Europeans to go along with strict conservation measures so we split the stock . ''
Rich Ruais , executive director of the East Coast Tuna Association , calls the Two - Stock Theory `` an international joke , and a tragic joke on U.S. fishermen .
The fish we conserve are feeding an expanding fishery in the East .
While we abide by catch and size restrictions , countries like Spain , Portugal and France are estimated to be fishing well over their quotas , '' he said .
`` In the Bay of Biscay , off the west coast of France , 50 percent of the catch is undersized , much of it age 0 fish , that 's less than four pounds . ''
Faced with the possibility of crippling quota reductions , many commercial and recreational fishermen , often at odds over domestic allocation , are joining forces and calling on science to help them challenge the validity of the Two - Stock Theory .
All agree that they have done their share for conservation and that it 's time for Eastern Atlantic countries to share the cost of rebuilding bluefin stocks .
To analyze movement trends of bluefin , a research project conducted by Dr. Molly Lutcavage of the New England Aquarium in Boston , with the aid of commercial fishermen and financial support from the East Coast Tuna Association , tagged 20 bluefin off Massachusetts in 1997 .
`` We were criticized for working with commercial fishermen , '' said Lutcavage .
`` But how could you not work with commercial fishermen ?
They 're the experts . ''
Dr. Barbara Block of Stanford University , in conjunction with the recreational fishery off Cape Hatteras , N.C. , undertook a similar , more extensive project involving more than 200 fish .
Both studies used `` pop-up tags , '' designed to release from the tuna after a specific period of time -- sometimes up to nine months -- and transmit data , via satellite , back to the scientists .
Results from Lutcavage 's work , though limited , are being used to challenge the current management system .
Of 20 tags attached to spawning-age fish , 8-plus years old , 17 have been retrieved .
After nine months , five fish had crossed into the Eastern management area , nearly 30 percent , 10 times what ICCAT assumed .
Block 's work , although designed mostly to test the technology , shows similar movement trends .
Most of her fish were tagged with long-term archival tags , but out of 37 tags released , 35 were retrieved , and two bluefin had crossed into the Eastern management area after only 90 days , the maximum time period of Block 's pop-up tags .
Dave Wilmot , chairman of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign , a coalition of environmental groups including the Audubon Society , World Wildlife Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council , is not convinced .
`` There is still too much uncertainty , '' he said .
`` As a scientist , I would be very reluctant to make important management decisions based on a handful of tags .
It 'll be another five years of research before we really begin to understand bluefin stock structure and spawning habits . ''
Wilmot notes that a lack of conservation action in the past has led to disastrous results in other fisheries .
`` If the U.S. wants to show it 's serious , then we 've got to take a leadership role by calling for catch reductions .
Inaction by other countries is no excuse for shirking our responsibility . ''
John Graves , chairman of the U.S. ICCAT advisory committee , has already made it clear that the pop-up tag surveys will not affect this year 's bluefin stock assessment .
But he has also stated unequivocally that the United States is going to be calling for stiff penalties against any country that continues to plunder this international resource .
In discussions with U.S. representatives , neither Japanese nor Canadian delegates have clarified their positions on possible quota reductions .
However , Pat Chamut , Canada 's assistant deputy minister for fisheries management , did say that `` Canadian fishermen will be less likely to go along with further restrictions unless something is done to bring the East in line . ''
Chamut called ICCAT 's inability to limit catches in the East `` appalling and disgraceful . ''
He said Canada would support sanctions against countries not in compliance with ICCAT recommendations .
In the Western management area , bluefin stocks appear to be rebounding .
National Marine Fisheries Service scientists acknowledge that there is a greater abundance of tuna than expected , but insist that stocks are at least 80 percent below the optimum levels called for in the 1996 congressional mandate for sustainable fisheries .
The best U.S. rebuilding efforts however , will affect only a small percentage of the Atlantic -wide stock .
Most parties , even many European scientists , agree that the conservation of bluefin tuna hinges in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean .
Whether ICCAT can control all its countries , and end overfishing and the targeting of undersized fish , remains to be seen .
