NEW YORK --
In an effort to reassure foreign investors , Venezuela 's president said Tuesday that his government would make all its debt payments while at the same time work on a market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current debt over a longer period of time .
`` We will continue to service our foreign debt , but we want to reduce the profile , '' President Hugo Chavez said through a translator at a New York news conference , held in part to give him a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies .
His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging markets in Latin America .
Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from the devaluation of its currency in January .
Venezuela 's news conference was organized by J.P. Morgan Securities , which is offering the government ideas on ways to rework its debt .
As the session began , Susana de la Puente , managing director for Latin American investment banking at J.P. Morgan Securities , noted that there had been `` a lot of bad press about Venezuela lately . ''
Neither Chavez nor his finance minister , Jose Rojas , would give any details of what kind of debt reworking they were thinking of .
But Ms. de la Puente said that if any proposal was made to revamp Venezuela 's $ 21.1 billion in foreign debt , it would be `` market driven , '' adding that there would be no `` involuntary restructuring . ''
She said it was possible to approach investors with a deal allowing Venezuela to swap current debt for new bonds .
`` We are waiting for the right opportunity , a good opportunity to do it , '' Chavez said .
Investor concern about the political and economic future of Venezuela has left its debt prices at levels just above those for Ecuador and Russia .
The Russians have effectively defaulted , and Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that would avoid a Brady bond default .
Brady bonds , which are named for Nicholas F. Brady , a former treasury secretary , were designed as a way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in the early 1980s .
The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds .
A 30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $ 96 million in interest and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday , right in the middle of the International Monetary Fund 's semiannual meeting .
Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current Brady bonds , although there have been reports that future oil revenue may be used as collateral .
Emerging -market analysts do not think debt restructuring will be easy for Ecuador .
And some say it will not be able to meet the requirements of an IMF economic program , which is a prerequisite for more international aid .
