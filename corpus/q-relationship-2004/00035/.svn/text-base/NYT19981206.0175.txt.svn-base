CARACAS , Venezuela --
With fireworks crackling and horns blaring , the boulevards filled with music , Venezuelans on Sunday night celebrated the overwhelming election victory of Hugo Chavez in a historic vote that delivered the former coup leader the presidency he failed to seize by force six years ago .
The former lieutenant colonel , who on Sunday defeated Yale -educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer , is the first leader in 40 years who has not come from Venezuela 's dominant political parties , and his meteoric success among legions of disaffected voters smashed the old-line party machinery long before election day .
`` Viva Venezuela !
Viva Chavez ! '' shouted euphoric crowds who filled a main avenue on Sunday night .
They chanted demands to rewrite the 1961 Constitution , which has ensured the rule of the elite for 40 years of Venezuela 's democracy .
`` Chavez : A National Feeling , '' announced a tall yellow banner raised to serve as the triumphant candidate 's backdrop .
As the streets throbbed with the joy of his supporters , nobody was really sure what Venezuela would look like under Chavez , who has been called a nationalist , a Communist , a hero and a would-be dictator .
During the campaign , he frequently sported the red beret of the military special forces he once led to storm the presidential palace and called on supporters to crush `` los corruptos '' on election day .
A fiery orator who has visited Cuba and praised President Fidel Castro , Chavez has become the symbol of hope through radical change for the four out of five Venezuelans who live in poverty , and the dangerous devil to the 20 percent who do not .
Within minutes of the announcement of his victory , Chavez pledged to seek moderation and foster forgiveness , after a campaign rife with disinformation , innuendo and dirty tricks .
Just days ago , at his closing rally in downtown Caracas , he had warned 700,000 supporters about the prospect they might lose the election through fraud .
On Sunday night , he told his supporters to `` celebrate , but with humility , even with silence , with reflection .
It 's not about sticking your head out of the window , because tomorrow we begin another battle '' to rebuild Venezuela , he said .
He called on Venezuelans to build `` with harmony , and with a great capacity for forgiveness . ''
`` To those who have made mistakes , we say , ` So did we . '
Let 's forgive each other our errors , '' Chavez said .
With 78 percent of the vote counted , Chavez had 56 percent compared to 40 percent for Salas , according to official results from the National Electoral Council .
Conceding defeat on Sunday at his campaign headquarters in Caracas , Salas said that `` not only do I accept my adversary 's victory , I also wish him much luck because his luck is Venezuela 's luck . ''
