VIENNA , Austria
-LRB- AP -RRB- --
Afghanistan 's opium poppy crop is expected to drop by 25 percent this year , the U.N. drug control agency said .
The decline is due mostly to bad weather rather than effective measures by the country 's Taliban religious rulers .
In a report , the Vienna -based U.N. Drug Control Program estimated Afghanistan 's 1998 production would reach about 2,100 metric tons down from the 1997 yield of 2,800 metric tons .
U.N. officials had expected this year 's crop to surpass last year 's .
Opium poppies are used to manufacture heroin , and U.N. officials said the decline means 70 tons -LRB- 63.5 metric tons -RRB- of illicit heroin will be off the world markets .
`` An unusually long 1998 winter season , heavy and continuous rains and hail storms in southern Afghanistan and unseasonal rains in northern Afghanistan are all factors which adversely affected the opium yield , '' the report said .
Despite the projected decline , the U.N. agency said opium poppy cultivation spread for the first time to two new Afghan provinces -- Loghar and Laghman -- as well as several new districts .
That raised concerns that -- barring an effective government crackdown -- next year 's crop could increase significantly if the weather improves .
`` I appeal to all parties in Afghanistan to exert their best efforts in order to dissuade the farmers from planting opium poppy in the coming growing season , especially in new areas , '' the head of the drug control agency , Pino Arlacchi , said .
Arlacchi warned that if his appeal goes unheeded , he will ask U.N. member states to tighten controls on Afghanistan 's land borders .
The United Nations estimates that heroin of Afghan origin accounts for 80 percent of the European market and 20 percent of the American .
