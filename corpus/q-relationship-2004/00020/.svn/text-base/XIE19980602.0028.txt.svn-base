CAIRO , June 1 -LRB- Xinhua -RRB- -- Saudi Arabia called on India and Pakistan to show great self-restraint , saying that nuclear tests conducted by both countries do not serve security and stability in the region , Kuwait News Agency reported Monday .
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Al - Faresi was quoted as saying that his country understood the viewpoint of Pakistani government as to safeguarding its security , but `` we still calls on both Pakistan and India to practice self-restraint and resume negotiations to ensure security and stability in South Asia . ''
Al - Faresi made the remarks in a statement after the weekly cabinet meeting .
He also said his country hopes the international community to avoid double-standard policy which turns a blind eye to Israel 's nuclear facilities .
Saudi Arabia supports a full ban of nuclear proliferation and seeks to make the Middle East a region free of mass-destruction weapons , he said .
Pakistan , in response to India 's nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13 , carried out six nuclear tests last week .
Meanwhile , Iran 's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that Tehran is against any nuclear test intended for weapon purposes , but favors civilian use of nuclear energy .
With Russian assistance , Iran is building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south .
This has raised doubt that Tehran may be seeking access to nuclear weapons .
`` Iran wants the Middle East and the Persian Gulf to be free from non-conventional weapons , '' Shamkhani said .
He said Iran supports compliance with the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty , but holds that elimination of non-conventional weapons and disarmament of Israel are prerequisites for banning proliferation of nuclear arms .
