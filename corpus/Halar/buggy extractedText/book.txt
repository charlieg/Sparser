REVIEW: USING THEMES TO CONNECT THE CONCEPTS OF BIOLOGY

   

Biology, the study of life, is rooted in the human spirit. People keep pets, nurture houseplants, invite avian visitors with backyard birdhouses, and visit zoos and nature preserves. Biology is the scientific extension of this human tendency to feel connected to and curious about all forms of life. It is a science for adventurous minds. It takes us, personally or vicariously, into jungles, deserts, seas, and other environments, where a variety of living forms and their physical surroundings are interwoven into complex webs called ecosystems. Studying life leads us into laboratories to examine more closely how living things, called organisms, work. Biology draws us into the microscopic world of the fundamental units of life known as cells and into the submicroscopic realm of the molecules that make up those cells. Our intellectual journey also takes us back in time, for biology encompasses not only contemporary life, but also a history of ancestral forms stretching nearly 4 billion years into the past. The scope of biology is immense. The purpose of this book is to introduce you to this multifaceted science.

You are becoming involved with biology during its most exciting era. The largest and best-equipped community of scientists in history is beginning to solve biological puzzles that once seemed unsolvable. We are moving ever closer to understanding how a single cell becomes a plant or animal; how the human mind works; how plants convert solar energy to the chemical energy of food; how organisms network in biological communities such as forests and coral reefs; and how the great diversity of life on Earth evolved from the first microbes.

Modern biology is as important as it is inspiring. Genetics and cell biology are revolutionizing medicine and agriculture. Molecular biology is providing new tools for anthropology, helping us trace the origin and dispersal of early humans. Ecology is helping us evaluate environmental issues, such as the causes and consequences of global warming. Neuroscience and evolutionary biology are reshaping psychology and sociology. These are just a few examples of how biology is weaving into the fabric of our culture as never before.

These are also the most challenging times to learn biology. The same discovery explosion that makes modern biology so exhilarating can also be intimidating, even to professional biologists. How, then, can beginning biology students hope to keep their heads above water in this deluge of data and discovery? The key is to recognize unifying themes that pervade all of biology--themes that will still apply decades from now, when much of the specific information presented in any textbook will be obsolete. This chapter introduces some broad, enduring themes in the study of life. The bulleted list on this page previews these ten themes.

EVOLUTION, UNITY, AND DIVERSITY

 

 Diversity and unity are the dual faces of life on Earth



 

 Evolution is the core theme of biology



We can think of biology's enormous scope as having two dimensions. The "vertical" dimension is the size scale that reaches all the way from molecules to the biosphere, as you learned in the preceding section. But there is also a "horizontal" dimension stretching across the great diversity of life, now and throughout life's history. Evolution is the key to understanding this biological diversity. Evolutionary change has been a central feature of life since it arose about 4 billion years ago. The evolutionary connections among all organisms explain the unity and diversity of life. This section introduces two related themes that will help you see these evolutionary connections throughout your study of life.





THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE

 

 Science is a process of inquiry that includes repeatable observations and testable hypotheses



 

 Science and technology are functions of society



Darwin helped develop biology as a science by seeking natural rather than supernatural causes for the unity and diversity of life. But what is science? And how do we tell the difference between science and other ways we try to make sense of nature?





REVIEW: USING THEMES TO CONNECT THE CONCEPTS OF BIOLOGY

In some ways, biology is the most demanding of all sciences, partly because living systems are so complex and partly because biology is a multidisciplinary science that requires a knowledge of chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Modern biology is the decathlon of natural science. And of all the sciences, biology is the most connected to the humanities and social sciences. If you are a biology major or a preprofessional student, you have an opportunity to become a versatile scientist. If you are a physical science major or an engineering student, you will discover in the study of life many applications for what you have learned in your other science courses. If you are a nonscience student enrolled in biology as part of a liberal arts education, you have selected a course in which you can sample many scientific disciplines.

No matter what brings you to biology, you will find the study of life to be challenging and uplifting. Do not let the details of biology spoil a good time. The complexity of life is inspiring, but it can be overwhelming. To help you from "getting lost in the forest because of all the trees," each chapter of this book is constructed from a manageable number of key concepts. The concepts are listed at the beginning of the chapter, are displayed throughout the chapter, and then reappear in the summary at the end of the chapter. The details of a chapter enrich your understanding of the concepts and how they fit together. This introductory chapter is the exception; instead of presenting the key concepts of a particular area of biology, this chapter has introduced themes that cut across all biological fields--ways of thinking about biology (TABLE 1.1). These ten themes, along with the key concepts in each chapter, will provide you with a framework for fitting together the many things you will learn in your multidisciplinary exploration of life--and will encourage you to begin asking important questions of your own.

 Each level of biological organization has emergent properties

A basic characteristic of life is a high degree of order. You can see it in the intricate pattern of veins throughout a leaf or in the colorful pattern of a bird's feathers. Biological order exists at all levels, even those invisible to the unaided eye.

A Hierarchy of Organization

Biological organization is based on a hierarchy of structural levels, each level building on the levels below it (FIGURE 1.2). Starting at the lowest level, atoms, the chemical building blocks of all matter, are ordered into complex biological molecules. Many of the molecules of life are arranged into minute structures called organelles, which are in turn the components of cells.

Fig 1-2. The hierarchy of biological organization. This sequence of images takes us all the way from atoms to a biological community of many interacting species.

Cells are subunits of organisms, and organisms are the units of life. Some organisms, such as amoebas, consist of single cells, but others are multicellular aggregates of many specialized types of cells. What an amoeba accomplishes with a single cell--the uptake and processing of nutrients, excretion of wastes, response to environmental stimuli, reproduction, and other functions--a human or other multicellular organism accomplishes with a division of labor among specialized cells. Unlike the amoeba, none of your cells could live for long on its own. The organism we recognize as an animal or plant is not a random collection of individual cells, but a multi cellular cooperative.

Multicellular organisms exhibit three major structural levels above the cell: Similar cells are grouped into tissues; specific arrangements of different tissues form organs; and organs are grouped into organ systems. For example, the signals (nerve impulses) that coordinate your movements are transmitted along specialized cells called neurons. The nervous tissue within your brain has billions of neurons organized into a communications network of spectacular complexity. The brain, however, is not pure nervous tissue; it is an organ built of many different tissues, including a type called connective tissue that forms the protective covering of the brain. The brain is itself part of the nervous system, which also includes the spinal cord and the many nerves that transmit messages between the spinal cord and other parts of the body. The nervous system is only one of several organ systems characteristic of humans and other complex animals.

In the hierarchy of biological organization, there are tiers beyond the individual organism. A population is a localized group of organisms belonging to the same species; populations of different species living in the same area make up a biological community; and community interactions that include nonliving features of the environment, such as soil and water, form an ecosystem.

Investigating biological organization at its many levels is fundamental to the study of life. This text essentially follows such an organization, beginning with the chemistry of life and ending with the study of ecosystems and the biosphere, the sum of all Earth's ecosystems. However, we will also see that biological processes often involve several levels of biological organization. For example, when a rattlesnake explodes from its coiled posture and strikes a mouse, the snake's coordinated movements result from complex interactions at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels within its body. This behavior also affects the biological community in which the snake and its prey live. Such episodes of predation can have an important cumulative impact on the sizes of both the mouse and the rattlesnake populations. Most biologists specialize in the study of life at a particular level, but they gain broader perspective when they integrate their discoveries with processes occurring at lower and higher levels.

Emergent Properties

With each step upward in the hierarchy of biological order, novel properties emerge that were not present at the simpler levels of organization. These emergent properties result from interactions between components. A molecule such as a protein has attributes not exhibited by any of its component atoms, and a cell is certainly much more than a bag of molecules. If the intricate organization of the human brain is disrupted by a head injury, that organ will cease to function properly, even though all its parts may still be present. And an organism is a living whole greater than the sum of its parts.

This theme of emergent properties accents the importance of structural arrangement and applies to inanimate material as well as to life. By itself, neither the head nor the handle of a hammer is very useful for driving nails; but put these parts together in a certain way, and the functional properties of a hammer emerge. Diamonds and graphite are both made of carbon, but they have different properties because their carbon atoms are arranged differently. The emergent properties of life are not supernatural, but simply reflect a hierarchy of structural organization without counterpart among inanimate objects.

Life resists a simple, one-sentence definition because it is associated with numerous emergent properties. Yet almost any child perceives that a dog or a bug or a tree is alive and a rock is not. We recognize life by what living things do. FIGURE 1.3 illustrates and describes some of the properties and processes we associate with the state of being alive.

Fig 1-3. Some properties of life.

Reductionism in Biology

Because the properties of life emerge from complex organization, scientists seeking to understand biological processes confront a dilemma. One horn of the dilemma is that we cannot fully explain a higher level of order by breaking it down into its parts. A dissected animal no longer functions; a cell reduced to its chemical ingredients is no longer a cell. Disrupting a living system interferes with the meaningful explanation of its processes. The other horn of the dilemma is the futility of trying to analyze something as complex as an organism or a cell without taking it apart. Reductionism--reducing complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study--is a powerful strategy in biology. For example, by studying the molecular structure of a substance called DNA that had been extracted from cells, James Watson and Francis Crick deduced, in 1953, how this molecule could serve as the chemical basis of inheritance. The central role of DNA was better understood, however, when it was possible to study its interactions with other substances in the cell. Biology balances the reductionist strategy with the longer-range objective of understanding emergent properties--how the parts of cells, organisms, and higher levels of order, such as ecosystems, are functionally integrated.





 Cells are an organism's basic units of structure and function

The cell is the lowest level of structure capable of performing all the activities of life. All organisms are composed of cells, the basic units of structure and function (see FIGURE 1.2).

The Cell Theory

Robert Hooke, an English scientist, first described and named cells in 1665, when he observed a slice of cork (bark from an oak tree) with a microscope that magnified 30 times (30&#160;X&#160;). Apparently believing that the tiny boxes, or "cells," that he saw were unique to cork, Hooke never realized the significance of his discovery. His contemporary, a Dutchman named Anton van Leeuwenhoek, discovered organisms we now know to be single-celled. Using grains of sand that he had polished into magnifying glasses as powerful as 300&#160;X&#160;, Leeuwenhoek discovered a microbial world in droplets of pond water and also observed the blood cells and sperm cells of animals. In 1839, nearly two centuries after the discoveries of Hooke and Leeuwenhoek, cells were finally acknowledged as the universal units of life by Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, two German biologists. In a classic case of inductive reasoning--reaching a generalization based on many concurring observations--Schleiden and Schwann summarized their own microscopic studies and those of others by concluding that all living things consist of cells. This generalization forms the basis of what is known as the cell theory. This theory was later expanded to include the idea that all cells come from other cells. The ability of cells to divide to form new cells is the basis for all reproduction and for the growth and repair of multicellular organisms, including humans.

The Two Main Cell Types

All cells are enclosed by a membrane that regulates the passage of materials between the cell and its surroundings. And every cell, at some stage in its life, contains DNA, the heritable material that directs the cell's many activities.

Two major kinds of cells--prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells--can be distinguished by their structural organization. The cells of the microorganisms called bacteria and archaea are prokaryotic. All other forms of life are composed of eukaryotic cells. Much more complex than the prokaryotic cell, the eukaryotic cell is subdivided by internal membranes into many different functional compartments--membrane-enclosed organelles (FIGURE 1.4). In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is organized along with certain proteins into structures called chromosomes contained within a nucleus, the largest organelle of most eukaryotic cells. Surrounding the nucleus is the cytoplasm, consisting of a thick fluid (cytosol) in which are suspended the various organelles that perform most of the cell's functions. Some eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, have tough walls external to their membranes. Animal cells lack walls.

Fig 1-4. Structural organization of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cell, found in plants, animals, and all other organisms except bacteria and archaea, is characterized by an extensive subdivision into many different functional compartments called organelles. The prokaryotic cell, unique to bacteria and archaea, is much simpler, lacking most of the organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Most prokaryotic cells are also much smaller than eukaryotic cells.

In the much simpler prokaryotic cell, the DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell in a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells also lack the cytoplasmic organelles typical of eukaryotic cells. Almost all prokaryotic cells have tough external cell walls.

Although prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells contrast sharply in complexity, we will see that they have some key similarities. Cells vary widely in size, shape, and specific structural features, but all are highly ordered structures that carry out complicated processes necessary for maintaining life.





 The continuity of life is based on heritable information in the form of DNA

Order implies information; instructions are required to arrange parts or processes in an organized way. Biological instructions are encoded in the molecule known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA is the substance of genes, the units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to offspring (FIGURE 1.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 1-5. The genetic material: DNA. DNA molecules carry biological information from one generation to the next.

Each DNA molecule is made up of two long chains arranged into what is called a double helix. Each chain is composed of four kinds of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. The way DNA conveys information is analogous to the way we arrange the letters of the alphabet into precise sequences with specific meanings. The word rat, for example, conjures up an image of a rodent; tar and art, which contain the same letters, mean quite different things. Libraries are filled with books containing information encoded in varying sequences of only 26 letters. We can think of nucleotides as the alphabet of inheritance. Specific sequential arrangements of these four chemical letters encode the precise information in a gene, which is typically hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long.

All forms of life employ essentially the same genetic code. A particular sequence of nucleotides says the same thing to one organism as it does to another; differences between organisms reflect differences between their nucleotide sequences. The diverse forms of life are different expressions of a common language for programming biological order.

Inheritance itself depends on a mechanism for copying DNA and passing its sequence of chemical letters on to offspring. As a cell prepares to divide to form two cells, it copies its DNA. A mechanical system that moves chromosomes then distributes the DNA copies equally to the two "daughter" cells. In species that reproduce sexually, offspring inherit copies of DNA from the parents' sperm and egg cells. The continuity of life over the generations and over the eons has its molecular basis in the replication of DNA.

The entire "library" of genetic instructions that an organism inherits is called its genome. The nucleus of each human cell packs a genome that is 3 billion chemical letters long. If this sequence of nucleotides were written in letters the size of those you are now reading, the information would fill more than a hundred books the size of this one. In 2001, scientists tabulating the sequence of these letters published a "rough draft" of the human genome. The press and world leaders acclaimed this international achievement as the greatest scientific triumph ever. But unlike past cultural zeniths, such as the landing of Apollo astronauts on the moon, the sequencing of the human genome is more a commencement than a climax. As the quest continues, biologists will learn the functions of thousands of genes and how their activities are coordinated in the development of an organism. It is a striking example of human curiosity about life at its many levels.





 Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization

Given a choice of tools, you would not loosen a screw with a hammer or pound a nail with a screwdriver. How a device works is correlated with its structure: Form fits function. Applied to biology, this theme is a guide to the anatomy of life at its many structural levels, from molecules to organisms. Analyzing a biological structure gives us clues about what it does and how it works. Conversely, knowing the function of a structure provides insight about its construction.

An example of this structure-function theme is the aerodynamically efficient shape of a bird's wing (FIGURE 1.6). The skeleton of the bird also has structural qualities that contribute to flight, with bones that have a strong but light honeycombed internal structure. The flight muscles of a bird are controlled by neurons (nerve cells), which transmit impulses. With their long extensions, neurons are especially well structured for communication. The flight muscles need plenty of energy, which they obtain from organelles called mitochondria. These organelles are the sites of cellular respiration, the chemical process that powers the cell by using oxygen to help tap the energy stored in sugar and other food molecules. A mitochondrion has an inner membrane with many infoldings. Molecules embedded in the inner membrane carry out many of the steps in cellular respiration, and the infoldings pack a large amount of this membrane into a minute container (see FIGURE 1.6d). In exploring life on its different structural levels, we discover functional beauty at every turn.

 Organisms are open systems that interact continuously with their environments

Life does not exist in a vacuum. An organism is an example of what scientists call an open system, an entity that exchanges materials and energy with its surroundings. Each organism interacts continuously with its environment, which includes other organisms as well as nonliving factors. The roots of a tree, for example, absorb water and minerals from the soil, and the leaves take in carbon dioxide from the air. Solar energy absorbed by chlorophyll, the green pigment of leaves, drives photosynthesis, which converts water and carbon dioxide to sugar and oxygen. The tree releases oxygen to the air, and its roots change the soil by breaking up rocks into smaller particles, secreting acid, and absorbing minerals. Both organism and environment are affected by the interaction between them. The tree also interacts with other life, including soil microorganisms associated with its roots and animals that eat its leaves and fruit.

Ecosystem Dynamics

The many interactions between organisms and their environment are interwoven to form the fabric of an ecosystem. The dynamics of any ecosystem include two major processes. One is the cycling of nutrients. For example, minerals acquired by plants will eventually be returned to the soil by microorganisms that decompose leaf litter, dead roots, and other organic debris. The second major process in an ecosystem is the flow of energy from sunlight to photosynthetic life (producers) to organisms that feed on plants (consumers) (FIGURE 1.7).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 1-7. An introduction to energy flow and energy transformation in an ecosystem. Living is work, and work requires that organisms obtain and use energy. Most ecosystems are solar powered. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert light energy to the chemical energy stored in sugar and other complex molecules. By breaking these fuel molecules down to simpler molecules, organisms can harvest the stored energy and put it to work. Animals and other consumers acquire their energy in chemical form by eating plants, by eating animals that ate plants, or by decomposing organic refuse, such as leaf litter and dead animals. The energy that enters an ecosystem in the form of sunlight exits in the form of heat, which all organisms dissipate to their surroundings.

Energy Conversion

The exchange of energy between an organism and its surroundings involves the transformation of one form of energy to another. For example, when a leaf produces sugar, it converts solar energy to chemical energy in sugar molecules. When an animal's muscle cells use sugar as fuel to power movements, they convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. All of the work of cells involves the transformation of chemical energy (which is ordered) into heat, which is the unordered energy of random molecular motion. Life requires the continual uptake of ordered energy and the release of some unordered energy to the surroundings.





 Regulatory mechanisms ensure a dynamic balance in living systems

If you strike a match, it undergoes a chemical reaction in which the chemical energy in its molecules is transformed into heat and light. Burning is unregulated energy transformation, obviously not a suitable way for living cells to transform energy. Organisms are able to obtain useful energy from fuel molecules such as sugar because cells break the molecules down in a series of closely regulated chemical reactions.

Regulation of the chemical reactions within cells centers on protein molecules called enzymes. Produced by the cells in which they function, enzymes are catalysts, substances that speed up chemical reactions. When your muscle cells need a lot of energy during exercise, enzymes catalyze the rapid breakdown of sugar (glucose) molecules, releasing energy that can be put to work. In contrast, when you rest, other enzymes catalyze the chemical conversion of glucose to storage substances that may be added to the body's fuel reserves. With one group of enzymes catalyzing the breakdown of glucose and another group catalyzing its formation, how is order maintained in the cell? A big part of the answer is that regulatory mechanisms determine precisely when, where, and how fast certain reactions occur in a cell.

Many biological processes are self-regulating, operating by a mechanism called feedback, in which an output or product of a process regulates that process. Negative feedback, also called feedback inhibition, slows or stops processes; positive feedback speeds a process up (FIGURE 1.8).

Fig 1-8. Regulation by feedback mechanisms.

Mammals and birds have a negative-feedback system that keeps body temperature within a narrow range, despite wide fluctuations in the animal's surroundings. A "thermostat" in the brain controls processes that hold the temperature of the blood close to a set point (about 37&#176;C in mammals). For instance, when the human body starts getting hot, signals from the brain's control center increase the activity of sweat glands and the diameter of blood vessels in the skin. Evaporative cooling results as sweating increases, and heat radiates from the blood vessels as they fill with warm blood. Negative feedback occurs as soon as the blood cools back to the set point, causing the control center to stop sending signals to the skin. If the blood temperature drops below the set point, the brain's control center inactivates the sweat glands and constricts the skin's blood vessels. This shunts blood to deeper tissues, reducing heat loss. When the blood warms back to the set point, negative feedback occurs again, and signals from the control center cease. This type of steady-state regulation, which keeps an internal factor such as body temperature within narrow tolerance limits, is called homeostasis (see FIGURE 1.3f).

The clotting of blood is an example of positive feedback. When a blood vessel is injured, structures in the blood called platelets start accumulating at the site. Positive feedback occurs as chemicals released by the platelets attract more platelets, and the platelet cluster initiates a complex sequence of chemical reactions that seals the wound with a clot.

Regulation by positive and negative feedback is a pervasive theme in biology, and we will see numerous examples throughout this text.





 Diversity and unity are the dual faces of life on Earth

Diversity is a hallmark of life. Biologists have identified and named about 1.5 million species, including over 280,000 plants, almost 50,000 vertebrates (animals with backbones), and more than 750,000 insects. Thousands of newly identified species are added to the list each year. Estimates of the total diversity of life range from about 5 million to over 30 million species.

Grouping Species: The Basic Concept

Biological diversity is something to relish and preserve, but it can also be a bit overwhelming (FIGURE 1.9). Confronted with complexity, humans are inclined to categorize diverse items into a smaller number of groups. Grouping species that are similar is natural for us. We may speak of squirrels and butterflies, though we recognize that many different species belong to each group. We may even sort groups into broader categories, such as rodents (which include squirrels) and insects (which include butterflies). Taxonomy, the branch of biology that names and classifies species, formalizes this hierarchical ordering (FIGURE 1.10). You will learn more about this taxonomic scheme in Chapter 25. For now, we focus on kingdoms and domains, the broadest units of classification.

Fig 1-9. A small sample of biological diversity. Shown here are just some of the tens of thousands of species in the butterfly and moth collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. As diverse as the species are, they are all variations on a common anatomical theme. One of biology's major goals is to explain how such diversity arises while also accounting for characteristics common to different species.

Fig 1-10. Classifying life. The taxonomic scheme classifies species into groups nested within more comprehensive groups. Species that are very closely related are placed in the same genus, genera are grouped into families, and so on, each level of classification being more comprehensive than those it includes. This example classifies the species Canis lupus, the wolf.

The Three Domains of Life

Until the past decade, most biologists divided the diversity of life into five main groups, or kingdoms. (The most familiar two are the plant and animal kingdoms.) But new methods, such as comparisons of DNA among organisms, have led to an ongoing reassessment of the number and boundaries of kingdoms. Various classification schemes are now based on six, eight, or more kingdoms. But as the debate continues on the kingdom level, there is broader consensus that the kingdoms of life can now be assigned to three even higher levels of classification called domains.

The three domains are named Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (FIGURE 1.11). The first two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, recognize two very different groups of organisms that both have prokaryotic cells. In the five-kingdom system, these prokaryotes were combined in a single kingdom. But newer evidence suggests that the organisms known as archaea may be more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to bacteria.

Fig 1-11. Three domains of life. The domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya represent three fundamentally different kinds of organisms. The domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of organisms, mostly unicellular, with prokaryotic cells (see FIGURE 1.4). The more traditional five-kingdom system of classification recognized all prokaryotes as members of one kingdom, Monera, plus the four kingdoms in the domain Eukarya (organisms with eukaryotic cells) shown here.

All the eukaryotes (organisms with eukaryotic cells) are grouped into at least four kingdoms in the domain Eukarya. Kingdom Protista consists of eukaryotic organisms that are generally single-celled--for example, the microscopic protozoans, such as the amoebas. Many biologists extend the boundaries of the kingdom Protista to include certain multicellular forms, such as seaweeds, that seem to be closely related to the unicellular protists. Other biologists split the protists into multiple kingdoms. The remaining three eukaryotic kingdoms--Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia--consist of multicellular eukaryotes. These three kingdoms are distinguished partly by their modes of nutrition. Plants produce their own sugars and other foods by photosynthesis. Fungi are mostly decomposers that absorb nutrients by breaking down dead organisms and organic wastes, such as leaf litter and animal feces. Animals obtain food by ingestion, which is the eating and digesting of other organisms. It is, of course, the kingdom to which we belong.

Unity in the Diversity of Life

If life is so diverse, how can biology have any unifying themes at all? What, for instance, can a tree, a mushroom, and a human possibly have in common? As it turns out, a great deal! Underlying the diversity of life is a striking unity, especially at the lower levels of biological organization. We have already seen one example: the universal genetic language of DNA. That ubiquitous feature connects all kingdoms of life, even uniting prokaryotes such as bacteria with eukaryotes such as humans. And among eukaryotes, unity is evident in many of the details of cell structure (FIGURE 1.12). Above the cellular level, however, organisms are so variously adapted to their ways of life that describing and classifying biological diversity remains an important goal of biology. It is the process called evolution that accounts for this combination of unity and diversity in life.

Fig 1-12. An example of unity underlying the diversity of life: the architecture of eukaryotic cilia. Eukaryotic organisms as diverse as the single-celled Paramecium and animals possess cilia, locomotor "hairs" that extend from cells. Comparing cross sections of cilia from diverse eukaryotes reveals a common structural organization. Such striking similarity in complex components contributes to the evidence that organisms as different as Paramecium and humans are, to some degree, related.





 Evolution is the core theme of biology

The history of life, as documented by fossils and other evidence, is a saga of a restless Earth billions of years old, inhabited by a changing cast of living forms (FIGURE 1.13). Life evolves. Just as an individual has a family history, each species is one twig of a branching tree of life extending back in time through ancestral species more and more remote. Species that are very similar, such as the brown bear and the polar bear, share a common ancestor that represents a relatively recent branch point on the tree of life. But through an ancestor that lived much farther back in time, all bears are also related to squirrels, humans, and all other mammals. Hair and milk-producing mammary glands are just two of a long list of uniquely mammalian traits. It is what we would expect if all mammals descended from a common ancestor, a prototypical mammal. And mammals, birds, reptiles, and all other vertebrates share a common ancestor even more ancient. Evidence of a still broader relationship can be found in such similarities as the matching machinery of all eukaryotic cilia (see FIGURE 1.12). Trace life back far enough, and there are only fossils of the primeval prokaryotes that inhabited Earth over 3.5 billion years ago. We can recognize some of their vestiges in our own cells--in the universal genetic code, for example. All of life is connected. And the basis for this kinship is evolution, the process that has transformed life on Earth from its earliest beginnings to the extensive diversity we see today. Evolution is the one theme that ties together all others and unifies biology.

The fossil record supports other evidence that life has changed dramatically over Earth's long history.

Darwin and Natural Selection

Charles Darwin (FIGURE 1.14) brought biology into focus in 1859 when he published The Origin of Species. Darwin's book presented two main concepts. First, Darwin argued convincingly from several lines of evidence that contemporary species arose from a succession of ancestors through a process of "descent with modification," his phrase for evolution. (The evidence for evolution is discussed in detail in Chapter 22.) Darwin's second concept in The Origin of Species was his theory for how life evolves. This proposed mechanism of evolution is called natural selection.

Fig 1-14. Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Darwin and his son William posed for this photograph in 1842. The author of numerous books and monographs on topics as diverse as barnacles, plant movements, and island geology, Darwin would be remembered as one of the greatest naturalists of the 19th century even if he had never published on the topic of evolution. But it was The Origin of Species that established Darwin's place as the most influential scientist in the development of modern biology. He is buried next to Isaac Newton in London's Westminster Abbey.

Darwin synthesized the concept of natural selection from observations that by themselves were neither new nor profound. Others had the pieces of the puzzle, but Darwin saw how they fit together. He inferred natural selection by connecting two observations:

OBSERVATION #1: Individual variation. Individuals in a population of any species vary in many heritable traits.

OBSERVATION #2: Struggle for existence. Any population of a species has the potential to produce far more offspring than the environment can possibly support with food, space, and other resources. This overproduction makes a struggle for existence among the variant members of a population inevitable.

INFERENCE: Differential reproductive success. Those individuals with traits best suited to the local environment generally leave a disproportionately large number of surviving, fertile offspring. This differential reproductive success of some individuals over others means that certain heritable traits (those carried by the best-suited individuals) are more likely to appear in each new generation. Darwin called differential reproductive success natural selection, and he envisioned it as the cause of evolution (FIGURE 1.15, p. 14).

We see the products of natural selection in the exquisite adaptations of organisms to the special problems posed by their environments (FIGURE 1.16, p. 14). Notice, however, that natural selection does not create adaptations; rather, it screens the heritable variations in each generation, increasing the frequencies of some variations and decreasing the frequencies of others over the generations. Natural selection is an editing process, with heritable variations exposed to environmental factors that favor the reproductive success of some individuals over others. The camouflage of the sea horse in FIGURE 1.16 did not result from individuals changing during their lifetimes to look more like their backgrounds and then passing that improvement on to offspring. The adaptation evolved over many generations by the greater reproductive success in each generation of individuals that were innately better camouflaged than the average member of the sea horse population.

Fig 1-16. Evolutionary adaptation is a product of natural selection. This sea horse lives among kelp (seaweed). The fish looks so much like a seaweed that it lures prey into the seeming safety of the kelp forest and then eats them. The camouflage also helps prevent the sea horse itself from becoming prey.

Natural Selection and the Diversity of Life

Darwin proposed that natural selection, by its cumulative effects over vast spans of time, could produce new species from ancestral species. This would occur, for example, if a population fragmented into several populations isolated in different environments. In these various arenas of natural selection, what began as one species could gradually diversify into many species as the geographically isolated populations adapted over many generations to different sets of environmental problems (FIGURE 1.17).

Fig 1-17. Diversification of finches on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands.(a) The Gal&aacute;pagos, which Darwin visited in 1835, are a relatively young cluster of volcanic islands about 900 kilometers (540 miles) off the Pacific coast of South America. The islands are home to many species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world, though Gal&aacute;pagos life-forms are clearly related to species inhabiting the South American mainland. (b) Fourteen species of finches classified in three different genera diversified on the various islands of the Gal&aacute;pagos. These birds probably descended from a common ancestor that managed to reach the Gal&aacute;pagos from the South American mainland several million years ago after volcanism built the islands. Note the specialization of beaks, which are adapted to various food sources on the different islands.

Descent with modification accounts for both the unity and the diversity we observe in life. In many cases, features shared by two species are due to their descent from common ancestors, and differences between the species are due to natural selection modifying the ancestral equipment in different environmental contexts. Evolution is the core theme of biology--a unifying thread that ties every chapter of this text together.





 Science is a process of inquiry that includes repeatable observations and testable hypotheses

The word science is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to know." Science is a way of knowing. It emerges from our curiosity about ourselves, the world, and the universe. Striving to understand seems to be one of our basic drives. At the heart of science are people asking questions about nature and believing that those questions are answerable. Scientists tend to be quite passionate in their quest for discovery. Max Perutz, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, put it this way: "A discovery is like falling in love and reaching the top of a mountain after a hard climb all in one, an ecstasy induced not by drugs but by the revelation of a face of nature that no one has seen before."

The process of science blends two main types of exploration: discovery science and hypothetico-deductive science. Most scientists practice a combination of these two forms of inquiry.

Discovery Science and Induction

Science seeks natural causes for natural phenomena. This limits the scope of science to the study of structures and processes that we can observe and measure, either directly or indirectly with the help of tools such as microscopes that extend our senses. This dependence on observations that other people can confirm demystifies nature and distinguishes science from supernatural explanations. Science can neither prove nor disprove that angels, ghosts, deities, or spirits, both benevolent and evil, cause storms, rainbows, illnesses, and cures, for such explanations are outside the bounds of science.

Verifiable observations and measurements are the data of discovery science (FIGURE 1.18). In our quest to describe nature accurately, we discover its structure and behavior. In biology, discovery science enables us to describe life at its many levels, from ecosystems down to cells and molecules. A naturalist's careful description of diverse plants and animals is an example of discovery science, sometimes called descriptive science. A more recent example is the sequencing of the human genome; it's not really a set of experiments, but a detailed dissection and description of the genetic material.

Fig 1-18. Careful observation and measurement provide the raw data for science. Cornell University's Eloy Rodriguez collects a sample of chemicals extracted from a plant. His analysis will determine the types and amounts of chemicals in the plant.

In contrast to the carefully structured description of the human genome, curious and observant people sometimes make totally serendipitous discoveries. One of the most famous examples is Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery that certain fungi produce chemicals that kill bacteria. Fleming, a Scottish physician and microbiologist, was culturing bacteria in glass dishes in his laboratory. After finding that a mold (fungus) had contaminated some of his bacterial cultures, he was in the process of discarding the cultures when he noticed that no bacteria were growing in the vicinity of the mold. The fungus turned out to be a common bread mold named Penicillium, which produces an antibacterial chemical that was later named penicillin. Quite by accident, Fleming had made a discovery that led to the use of penicillin and other antibiotics to cure syphilis, meningitis, and many other diseases caused by bacteria.

Discovery science can lead to important conclusions based on a type of logic called inductive reasoning. An inductive conclusion is a generalization that summarizes many concurrent observations. "All organisms are made of cells" is an example. That induction was based on two centuries of biologists discovering cells in every biological specimen they observed with microscopes. The careful observations of discovery science and the inductive conclusions they sometimes produce are fundamental to our understanding of nature.

Hypothetico-Deductive Science

The observations of discovery science engage inquisitive minds to ask questions and seek explanations. Ideally, such investigation consists of what is called the scientific method. As a formal process of inquiry, the scientific method consists of a series of steps, but few scientists adhere rigidly to this prescription (FIGURE 1.19). Science is a less structured process than most people realize. Although it would be misleading to reduce science to a stereotyped method, we can identify the key element of the method. It is called hypothetico-deductive reasoning. The "hypothetico" refers to what scientists call hypotheses.

Fig 1-19. Idealized version of the scientific method. Although science rarely conforms exactly to this protocol of steps, inquiry usually involves posing and testing hypotheses.

A hypothesis is a tentative answer to some question--an explanation on trial. It is usually an educated guess. We all use hypotheses in solving everyday problems. Let's say, for example, that your flashlight fails during a camp-out. That's an observation. The question is obvious: Why doesn't the flashlight work? A reasonable hypothesis based on past experience is that the batteries in the flashlight are dead.

"If &#160;...&#160; then" Logic. The deductive in hypothetico-deductive reasoning refers to the use of deductive logic to test hypotheses. Deduction differs from induction, which, remember, is reasoning from a set of specific observations to reach a general conclusion. In deduction, the reasoning flows in the opposite direction, from the general to the specific. From general premises, we extrapolate to the specific results we should expect if the premises are true. If all organisms are made of cells (premise 1) and humans are organisms (premise 2), then humans are composed of cells (deductive prediction about a specific case).

In the process of science, the deduction usually takes the form of predictions about what outcomes of experiments or observations we should expect if a particular hypothesis (premise) is correct. We then test the hypothesis by performing the experiment to see whether or not the results are as predicted. This deductive testing takes the form of "If&#160;...&#160;then" logic:

OBSERVATION: My flashlight doesn't work.

QUESTION: What's wrong with my flashlight?

HYPOTHESIS: The flashlight's batteries are dead.

PREDICTION: If this hypothesis is correct

EXPERIMENT: and I replace the batteries with new ones,

PREDICTED RESULT: then the flashlight should work.

Let's say the flashlight still doesn't work. We can test an alternative hypothesis if new flashlight bulbs are available (FIGURE 1.20). We could also blame the dead flashlight on campground ghosts playing tricks, but that hypothesis is untestable and therefore outside the realm of science.

Fig 1-20. Applying hypothetico-deductive reasoning to a campground problem.

A Case Study. You should now be able to recognize the hypothetico-deductive process in an elegant study reported in the scientific literature. For many years, David Reznick of the University of California, Riverside, and John Endler of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have been investigating differences between populations of guppies in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are small freshwater fishes you probably recognize as common aquarium pets. In the Aripo River system of Trinidad, guppies live in small pools as populations that are relatively isolated from one another. In some cases, two populations inhabiting the same stream live less than 100 m (meters) apart, but they are separated by a waterfall that impedes the migration of guppies between the two pools.

When Reznick and Endler compared guppy populations, they observed differences in what are called life history characteristics. These characteristics included the average age and size of guppies when they reach sexual maturity and begin to reproduce. The researchers were able to correlate variations in these life history characteristics with the types of predators present in different locations. In some pools, the main predator is a small fish called a killifish, which preys predominantly on small, juvenile guppies. In other locations, a larger predator called a pike-cichlid preys more intensely on guppies and mainly eats relatively large, sexually mature individuals. Guppies in populations exposed to these pike-cichlids reproduce at a younger age and are smaller at maturity, on average, than guppies that coexist with killifish.

What causes these life history differences between the guppy populations? Correlation with the type of predator present is suggestive, but a correlation does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship. The type of predator present and the life history characteristics of the guppy populations in a particular location may be independent consequences of some third factor. In fact, Reznick and Endler tested the hypothesis that the life history variations were due to differences in water temperature or other features of the physical environment. Notice the "If&#160;...&#160; then" logic characteristic of the hypothetico-deductive approach.

HYPOTHESIS #1: If differences in physical environments cause variations in the life histories of guppy populations,

EXPERIMENT: and samples from different wild guppy populations are collected and maintained for several generations in identical environments in predator-free aquaria,

PREDICTED RESULT: then the laboratory populations should become more similar in their life history characteristics.

When the researchers performed this experiment, the differences persisted for many generations. This result eliminates hypothesis #1 and also indicates that the life history differences in guppy populations are inherited. Based on the assumption that natural selection can lead to genetic differences in populations, Reznick and Endler tested the following explanation:

HYPOTHESIS #2: If the feeding preferences of different predators caused contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection,

EXPERIMENT: and guppies are transplanted from locations with pike-cichlids (predators of mature guppies) to guppy-free sites inhabited by killifish (predators of juvenile guppies),

PREDICTED RESULT: then the transplanted guppy populations should show a generation-to-generation trend toward later maturation and larger size--life history characteristics typical of natural guppy populations that coexist with killifish.

Reznick and Endler introduced guppies from locations with pike-cichlids to sites that had killifish but no guppies (FIGURE 1.21). Over a period of 11 years, the scientists compared the transplanted guppy populations with populations left in the pike-cichlid pools. The biologists measured such life history as age and size at maturity. To be certain that only heritable differences were counted, the scientists made their measurements after samples from the transplanted and non-transplanted guppy populations had been reared for two generations in identical aquarium environments. After 11 years, or 30 to 60 generations, the transplanted guppies had an average weight at maturity that was about 14%  greater than the guppies that were not transplanted to killifish pools. Other life history traits also changed in the direction predicted by the hypothesis that they type of predator affects the evolution of these traits in guppy populations (bar graphs in FIGURE 1.21).

Fig 1-21. Controlled experiments to test the hypothesis that selective predation affects the evolution of guppy populations.

The experimental design in our case study is an example of what scientists call a controlled experiment. In a controlled experiment, comparisons are made between two sets of subjects--guppy populations, in this case. The set that receives the experimental treatment is called the experimental group. In our example, the experimental group consisted of the guppies that Reznick and Endler transplanted from pike-cichlid pools to killifish pools. In contrast, the control group--the guppies that remained in the pike-cichlid pools, in this case--does not receive the experimental treatment. Ideally, the experimental treatment is the only difference between the experimental group and the control group. Such a controlled experiment enables researchers to focus on responses to a single variable--a change of predator in the guppy experiments.

Without a control group for comparison, there would be no way to tell whether it was the killifish or some other factor that caused the transplanted guppy populations to change. But because control sites and experimental sites were often nearby pools of the same stream, the main variable was probably the different predators. And the researchers observed similar results when guppies were reared in artificial streams that were identical except for the type of predator.

Of the several hypotheses Reznick and Endler have tested (we examined only two), they are left with natural selection due to differential predation on larger versus smaller guppies as the most likely explanation for the observed differences between guppy populations. Apparently, when predators such as pike-cichlids prey mainly on reproductively mature adults, the chance that a guppy will survive to reproduce several times is relatively low. The guppies with greatest reproductive success should then be the individuals that mature at a young age and small size and produce at least one brood before growing to a size preferred by the local predator. The controlled experiments of Reznick and Endler documented evolution in a natural setting over a relatively short time (within only 11 years in the study we have followed).

Our case study reinforces the important point that scientific hypotheses must be testable. Without such testing, ideas about nature, such as speculations on size differences in guppies, are "just so" stories. And explaining that something is true because "it's just so" is not very convincing.

Theories in Science

Many people associate facts with science, but accumulating facts is not what science is primarily about. A telephone book is an impressive catalog of factual information, but it has little to do with science. It is true that facts, in the form of verifiable observations and repeatable experimental results, are the prerequisites of science. What really advances science, however, is some new theory that ties together a number of observations and experimental results that previously seemed unrelated. The cornerstones of science are the explanations that apply to the greatest variety of phenomena. People like Newton, Darwin, and Einstein stand out in the history of science not because they discovered a great many facts, but because their theories had such broad explanatory power.

What is a scientific theory, and how is it different from a hypothesis? Compared with a hypothesis, a theory is much broader in scope. This is a hypothesis: "Feeding preferences of different predators cause contrasting life histories in different guppy populations to evolve by natural selection." But this is a theory: "Populations can evolve by natural selection because of feeding preferences of predators."

Because theories are so comprehensive, they only become widely accepted in science if they are supported by an accumulation of extensive and varied evidence. This use of the term theory in science for a comprehensive explanation supported by abundant evidence contrasts with our everyday usage, which equates theories more with speculations or hypotheses. Natural selection qualifies as a scientific theory because of its broad application and because it has been validated by a continuum of observations and experiments. (You will find many examples in Units Four and Eight of this textbook.)

Scientific theories are not the only way of "knowing nature," of course. A comparative religion course would be an excellent opportunity to learn about the diverse legends that tell of a supernatural creation of Earth and its life. Science and religion are two very different ways of trying to make sense of nature. Art is still another way. A broad education should include exposure to these different ways of viewing nature. Each of us synthesizes our worldview by integrating our life experiences and multidisciplinary education. As a science textbook that is part of that broad education, Biology showcases life in the scientific context of evolution, the one theme that continues to hold all of biology together no matter how big and complex the subject becomes.

Science as a Social Process

The Hollywood image of the socially challenged scientist working alone in a secluded laboratory is as much a false stereotype as the idea that scientists always practice the scientific method in rigid lockstep. The reality is that science is an intensely social activity. Most scientists work in teams, and in academic environments the research groups often include both graduate and undergraduate students (FIGURE 1.22). If you survey the table of contents of some scientific journals in your college library, you'll find that the majority of articles are coauthored by teams of two or more scientists. And those journal articles make another point about the social nature of science: Research results are inert until shared with a broader community of peers.

It is not unusual that several scientists are asking the same questions. Such convergence contributes to the progressive and self-correcting qualities of science. Scientists build on what has been learned from earlier research, and they pay close attention to contemporary scientists working in the same field. Scientists share information through publications, seminars, meetings, and personal communication. The Internet has added a new medium for this exchange of ideas and data.

Both cooperation and competition characterize the scientific culture. Scientists working in the same research field subject one another's work to careful scrutiny. It is common for scientists to check on each other's claims by attempting to repeat experiments. This obsession with evidence and confirmation helps characterize the scientific style of inquiry. Scientists are generally skeptics.

We have seen that science has two related features that distinguish it from other styles of inquiry: (1) a dependence on observations and measurements that others can verify and (2) the requirement that ideas (hypotheses and theories) are testable by observations and experiments that others can repeat.

Throughout this book, you will find many examples of science in action, each marked by the icon that is shown on the right.

The Cultural Context of Science

The sociology of biology extends beyond the boundaries of the scientific community; science as a whole is embedded in the culture of its times. Just one example is the increasing proportion of women in biology and the impact they are having on the research being performed. A few decades ago, for instance, biologists who studied the mating behavior of animals focused most of their attention on competition among males for access to females. More recent research is revealing the role that females play in choosing mates. For example, in many bird species, females prefer the bright coloration that "advertises" a male's vigorous health, a behavior that enhances the probability of having healthy offspring.

Some philosophers of science argue that scientists are so influenced by cultural and political values that science is no more objective than other ways of "knowing nature." At the other extreme are people who speak of scientific theories as though they were natural laws instead of human interpretations of nature. The reality of science is probably somewhere in between. The cultural milieu affects scientific fashion, but the criterion of repeatability in observation and hypothesis testing still defines science as fundamentally different from other strategies of knowing nature. This distinction also contrasts the provisional status of science-based knowledge with unconditional beliefs based on faith. There are many examples of cherished hypotheses and even theories in science that were eventually remodeled or rejected in light of compelling new data. A hundred years ago, for instance, most biologists agreed that fungi and bacteria were types of plants. And there are also cases of entrenched theories that went unchallenged for too long because they fit so comfortably into the current cultural context or because there was a tendency to reject evidence that "rocked the boat." The theory of a geocentric (Earth-centered) universe is an example. But such historical examples of theories that persisted in science in spite of their incompatibility with an accumulation of repeatable measurements and experiments are relatively rare. If there is "truth" in science, it is based on a preponderance of the available evidence.





 Science and technology are functions of society

Science and technology are associated. In many cases, technology results from scientific discoveries applied to the development of goods and services. Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA through the process of science. This breakthrough sparked an explosion of scientific activity that led to a better understanding of DNA chemistry and the genetic code. These discoveries eventually made it possible to manipulate DNA, enabling genetic technologists to transplant foreign genes into microorganisms and mass-produce such valuable products as human insulin. The new biotechnology is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry, and DNA technology has also had an enormous impact in other areas, including agriculture and the legal profession (FIGURE 1.23). Perhaps Watson and Crick envisioned that their discovery would someday have technological applications, but that was probably not what motivated their research; nor could they have predicted exactly what the applications would be.

Fig 1-23. Two examples of DNA technology.

Not all technology can be described as applied science. In fact, technology predates science, driven by inventive humans who built tools, crafted pots, mixed paints, designed musical instruments, and made clothing--all without necessarily understanding why their inventions worked. Science catalyzes certain technologies by complementing trial and error with more informed design. But the direction technology takes depends less on science than it does on the needs of humans and the values of society.

Technology has improved our standard of living in many ways, but not without introducing some new problems. Technology, especially technology that keeps people healthier, has enabled the human population to grow more than tenfold in the past three centuries. The environmental consequences are enormous. Acid rain, deforestation, global warming, nuclear accidents, ozone holes, toxic wastes, landscapes degraded by exploration for oil and other natural resources, and extinction of species are just a few of the repercussions from more and more people wielding more and more technology. Science can help us identify problems and provide insight about what course of action may prevent further damage. But solutions to these problems have as much to do with politics, economics, culture, and values as with science and technology.

Now that both science and technology have become such powerful functions of society, it is more important than ever to distinguish "what we would like to understand" from "what we would like to build." Scientists should not distance themselves from technology but instead try to influence how scientific discoveries are applied. And scientists have a responsibility to help educate politicians, bureaucrats, corporate leaders, and voters about how science works and about the potential benefits and hazards of specific technologies. The crucial relationship between science, technology, and society is a theme that increases the significance of any biology course.

Like other animals, beetles have evolved structures and mechanisms that defend them from attack. As chemical ecologist Thomas Eisner described in the interview opening this unit, the soil-dwelling bombardier beetle has a particularly effective mechanism for dealing with the ants that plague it. Upon detecting an ant on its body, this beetle ejects a spray of boiling hot liquid from glands in its abdomen, aiming the spray directly at the ant. (In the photo on this page, the beetle aims its spray at Dr. Eisner's forceps.) The spray contains irritating chemicals that are generated at the moment of ejection by the explosive reaction of two sets of chemicals stored separately in the glands. The reaction produces heat and an audible pop.

Research on the bombardier beetle has involved chemistry, physics, and engineering, as well as biology. This is not surprising, for unlike a college catalog of courses, nature is not neatly packaged into the individual natural sciences. Biologists specialize in the study of life, but organisms and the world they live in are natural systems to which basic concepts of chemistry and physics apply. Biology is a multidisciplinary science.

This unit of chapters introduces key concepts of chemistry that will apply throughout our study of life. We will make many connections to the themes introduced in Chapter 1. One of those themes is the organization of life into a hierarchy of structural levels (FIGURE 2.1), with additional properties emerging at each successive level. In this unit, we will see how the theme of emergent properties applies to the lowest levels of biological organization--to the ordering of atoms into molecules and to the interactions of those molecules within cells. Somewhere in the transition from molecules to cells, we will cross the blurry boundary between nonlife and life.

 Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds

Organisms are composed of matter, which is anything that takes up space and has mass.* Matter exists in many diverse forms, each with its own characteristics. Rocks, metals, oils, gases, and you and I are just a few examples of what seems an endless assortment of matter.

Some of the ancient Greek philosophers believed that the great variety of matter arises from four basic ingredients, or elements. They believed these elements to be air, water, fire, and earth--supposedly pure substances that could not be decomposed to other forms of matter. All other substances were thought to be formed by blending various proportions of two or more of the elements. Although these ancient philosophers proposed the wrong elements, their basic idea was correct.

An element is a substance that cannot be broken down to other substances by chemical reactions. Today, chemists recognize 92 elements occurring in nature; gold, copper, carbon, and oxygen are examples. Each element has a symbol, usually the first letter or two of its name. Some of the symbols are derived from Latin or German names; for instance, the symbol for sodium is Na, from the Latin word natrium.

A compound is a substance consisting of two or more elements combined in a fixed ratio. Table salt, for example, is sodium chloride (NaCl), a compound composed of the elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) in a 1:1 ratio. Pure sodium is a metal and pure chlorine is a poisonous gas. Chemically combined, however, sodium and chlorine form an edible compound. This is a simple example of organized matter having emergent properties: A compound has characteristics beyond those of its combined elements (FIGURE 2.2).

 Life requires about 25 chemical elements

About 25 of the 92 natural elements are known to be essential to life. Just four of these--carbon (C), oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N)--make up 96%  of living matter. Phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and a few other elements account for most of the remaining 4%  of an organism's weight. TABLE 2.1 (p. 28) lists by percentage the elements that make up the human body; the percentages for other organisms are similar. FIGURE 2.3 (p. 28) illustrates the effect of nitrogen deficiency in a plant.

In this controlled experiment, the plants on the left are growing in soil that was fertilized with compounds containing nitrogen, an essential element. The soil on the right is deficient in nitrogen. If the poorly nourished crop growing in this deficient soil is harvested, it will yield less food--and less nutritious food--than the crop on the left.

Some trace elements, such as iron (Fe), are needed by all forms of life; others are required only by certain species. For example, in vertebrates (animals with backbones), the element iodine (I) is an essential ingredient of a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A daily intake of only 0.15 milligram (mg) of iodine is adequate for normal activity of the human thyroid. An iodine deficiency in the diet causes the thyroid gland to grow to abnormal size, a condition called goiter (FIGURE 2.4). Where it is available, iodized salt has reduced the incidence of goiter.

 Atomic structure determines the behavior of an element

Each element consists of a certain kind of atom that is different from the atoms of any other element. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that still retains the properties of an element. Atoms are so small that it would take about a million of them to stretch across the period printed at the end of this sentence. We symbolize atoms with the same abbreviation used for the element made up of those atoms; thus, C stands for both the element carbon and a single carbon atom.

Subatomic Particles

Although the atom is the smallest unit having the properties of its element, these tiny bits of matter are composed of even smaller parts, called subatomic particles. Physicists have split the atom into more than a hundred types of particles, but only three kinds of particles are stable enough to be of relevance here: neutrons, protons, and electrons. Neutrons and protons are packed together tightly to form a dense core, or atomic nucleus, at the center of the atom. The electrons, moving at nearly the speed of light, form a cloud around the nucleus (FIGURE 2.5).

Fig 2-5. Two simplified models of a helium (He) atom. The helium nucleus consists of 2 neutrons (gray) and 2 protons (magenta). Two electrons move rapidly around the nucleus. In model (a), the electrons are represented as a cloud of negative charge. The cloud is not to scale; it is actually much bigger relative to the nucleus. In (b), the electrons are shown as small blue spheres; the circle indicates that their average distance from the nucleus is about two-thirds of the radius of the electron cloud. (Our model of an atom will be refined as the chapter progresses.)

Electrons and protons are electrically charged. Each electron has one unit of negative charge, and each proton has one unit of positive charge. A neutron, as its name implies, is electrically neutral. Protons give the nucleus a positive charge, and it is the attraction between opposite charges that keeps the rapidly moving electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus.

The neutron and proton are almost identical in mass, each about 1.7 &#160;X&#160; 10-24 gram (g). Grams and other conventional units are not very useful for describing the mass of objects so minuscule. Thus, for atoms and subatomic particles (and for molecules, as well), we use a unit of measurement called the dalton, in honor of John Dalton, the British scientist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800. (The dalton is the same as the atomic mass unit, or amu, a unit you may have encountered elsewhere.) Neutrons and protons have masses close to 1 dalton. Because the mass of an electron is only about 1/2,000 that of a neutron or proton, we can ignore electrons when computing the total mass of an atom.

Atomic Number and Atomic Weight

Atoms of the various elements differ in their number of subatomic particles. All atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nuclei. This number of protons, which is unique to that element, is referred to as the atomic number and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol for the element. The abbreviation 2He, for example, tells us that an atom of the element helium has 2 protons in its nucleus. Unless otherwise indicated, an atom is neutral in electrical charge, which means that its protons must be balanced by an equal number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number tells us the number of protons and also the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom.

We can deduce the number of neutrons from a second quantity, the mass number, which is the sum of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number is written as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, we can use this shorthand to write an atom of helium as 24He. Because the atomic number indicates how many protons there are, we can determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number: A 24He atom has 2 neutrons. An atom of sodium, 1123Na, has 11 protons, 11 electrons, and 12 neutrons. The simplest atom is hydrogen 11H, which has no neutrons; it consists of a lone proton with a single electron moving around it.

Almost all of an atom's mass is concentrated in its nucleus, because the contribution of electrons to mass is negligible. Because neutrons and protons each have a mass very close to 1 dalton, the mass number is an approximation of the total mass of an atom, usually called its atomic weight. So, we might say that the atomic weight of helium (24He) is 4 daltons, although more precisely it is 4.003 daltons.

Isotopes

All atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, but some atoms have more neutrons than other atoms of the same element and therefore weigh more. These different atomic forms are referred to as isotopes of the element. In nature, an element occurs as a mixture of its isotopes. For example, consider the three isotopes of the element carbon, which has the atomic number 6. The most common isotope is carbon-12, 126C, which accounts for about 99%  of the carbon in nature. It has 6 neutrons. Most of the remaining 1%  of carbon consists of atoms of the isotope 136C, with 7 neutrons. A third, even rarer isotope, 146C, has 8 neutrons. Notice that all three isotopes of carbon have 6 protons--otherwise, they would not be carbon. Although isotopes of an element have slightly different masses, they behave identically in chemical reactions. (The number usually given as the atomic weight of an element is actually an average of the atomic weights of all the element's naturally occurring isotopes.)

Both 12C and 13C are stable isotopes, meaning that their nuclei do not have a tendency to lose particles. The isotope 14C, however, is unstable, or radioactive. A radioactive isotope is one in which the nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, radioactive carbon decays to form nitrogen.

Radioactive isotopes have many useful applications in biology. In Chapter 25, you will learn how researchers use measurements of radioactivity in fossils to date those relics of past life. Radioactive isotopes are also useful as tracers to follow atoms through metabolism, the chemical processes of an organism. Cells use the radioactive atoms as they would nonradioactive isotopes of the same element, but the radioactive tracers can be readily detected. FIGURE 2.6 shows two methods biologists use to monitor radioactive tracers.

Fig 2-6. Using radioactive isotopes to study cell chemistry. Scientists use radioactive isotopes to label certain chemical substances in order to follow a metabolic process or locate the substance within a cell or an organism. (a) This researcher is performing an experiment to determine how temperature affects the rate at which certain cells make new copies of their DNA. First, the cells are placed in a medium that includes the ingredients for making DNA. One ingredient is labeled with 3H, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Any new DNA the cells make will incorporate 3H. Separate samples of the cells in their radioactive medium are incubated at different temperatures. After an allotted amount of time, samples are taken from each culture and their DNA is tested for radioactivity in a device called a scintillation counter (shown here). The DNA samples are placed in vials containing a fluid that emits flashes of light whenever radiation from the decay of the 3H tracer in the DNA excites chemicals in the fluid. The frequency of flashes, proportional to the amount of radioactive DNA present, is measured in counts per minute. When the counts for the various DNA samples are plotted against the temperature at which the cells were grown, as in the graph here, it is apparent that temperature dramatically affects the rate of DNA synthesis. This result might be useful to researchers studying the details of DNA synthesis. (b) A technique known as autoradiography can be used to locate the radioactively labeled DNA from part (a) within the cells. Thin slices of the cells are placed on glass slides and kept for some time in the dark covered by a layer of photographic emulsion. Radiation from the radioactive tracer present in any new DNA exposes the photographic emulsion, creating a pattern of black dots. In the photo, radioactive DNA in the cell on the left is clearly located in the cell's nucleus.

Radioactive tracers are important diagnostic tools in medicine. For example, certain kidney disorders can be diagnosed by injecting small doses of substances containing radioactive isotopes into the blood and then measuring the amount of tracer excreted in the urine. Radioactive tracers are also used in combination with sophisticated imaging instruments, such as PET scanners, which can monitor chemical processes as they actually occur in the body (FIGURE 2.7).

Fig 2-7. A PET scan, --a medical use for radioactive isotopes. PET, an acronym for positron-emission tomography, detects locations of intense chemical activity in the body. The patient is first injected with a nutrient such as glucose labeled with a radioactive isotope that emits subatomic particles called positrons. The positrons collide with electrons made available by chemical reactions in the body. A PET scanner detects the energy released in these collisions and maps as "hot spots" the regions of an organ that are most chemically active at the time. The color of the image varies with the amount of the isotope present in an area. In this image the bright yellow color identifies cancerous bone tissue in the patient's spine and at the bottom of one shoulder blade.

Although radioactive isotopes are very useful in biological research and medicine, radiation from decaying isotopes also poses a hazard to life by damaging cellular molecules. The severity of this damage depends on the type and amount of radiation an organism absorbs. One of the most serious environmental threats is radioactive fallout from nuclear accidents (FIGURE 2.8).

Fig 2-8. The Tokaimura nuclear accident. In 1999, workers at a nuclear power plant in Tokaimura, Japan, accidentally triggered a chain reaction that leaked large amounts of radioactivity into the surroundings. The accident exposed 46 workers in the plant to dangerous radiation doses. A mile from the plant, radiation levels peaked at 15,000 times higher than normal. About 300,000 people in nearby towns were checked for radioactive contamination, as shown here, and will continue to be monitored for possible long-term damage, such as cancers.

The Energy Levels of Electrons

The simplified models of the atom in FIGURE 2.5 greatly exaggerate the size of the nucleus relative to the volume of the whole atom. If the nucleus were the size of a golf ball, the electrons would be moving about the nucleus at an average distance of approximately 1 kilometer (km). Atoms are mostly empty space.

When two atoms approach each other during a chemical reaction, their nuclei do not come close enough to interact. Of the three kinds of subatomic particles we have discussed, only electrons are directly involved in the chemical reactions between atoms.

An atom's electrons vary in the amount of energy they possess. Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Potential energy is the energy that matter stores because of its position or location. For example, because of its altitude, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy. When the gates of the reservoir's dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy comes out of storage to do work, such as turning generators. Because potential energy has been expended, the water stores less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reservoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move to the lowest possible state of potential energy; in this example, water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity.

The electrons of an atom also have potential energy because of their position in relation to the nucleus. The negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus; the more distant the electrons are from the nucleus, the greater their potential energy. Unlike the continuous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain discrete amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase. The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. An electron cannot exist in between its fixed states of potential energy.

The different states of potential energy that electrons have in an atom are called energy levels, or electron shells (FIGURE 2.9). The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the lowest energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, electrons in the third shell more energy still, and so on. An electron can change its shell, but only by absorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the difference in potential energy between the old shell and the new shell. To move to a shell farther out from the nucleus, the electron must absorb energy. For example, light energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. (Indeed, this is the first step when plants harness the energy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that produces food from carbon dioxide and water.) To move to a shell closer to the nucleus, an electron must lose energy, which is usually released to the environment in the form of heat. For example, when sunlight excites electrons in the paint of a dark car roof to higher energy levels, the roof heats up as the electrons fall back to their original levels.

Fig 2-9. Energy levels of an atom's electrons. Electrons exist only at fixed levels of potential energy, which are also called electron shells. An electron can move from one level to another only if the energy it gains or loses is exactly equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. Arrows indicate some of the stepwise changes in potential energy that are possible.

Electron Configuration and Chemical Properties

The chemical behavior of an atom is determined by its electron configuration--that is, the distribution of electrons in the atom's electron shells. Beginning with hydrogen, the simplest atom, we can imagine building the atoms of the other elements by adding 1 proton and 1 electron at a time (along with an appropriate number of neutrons). FIGURE 2.10, an abbreviated version of what is called a periodic table, shows this distribution of electrons for the first 18 elements, from hydrogen (1H) to argon (18Ar). The elements are arranged in three rows, or periods, corresponding to the number of electron shells in their atoms. The left-to-right sequence of elements in each row corresponds to the sequential addition of electrons (and protons).

Fig 2-10. Electron configurations of the first 18 elements. In these diagrams, electrons are shown as blue dots and energy levels (electron shells) as concentric rings. The elements are arranged in rows, each representing the filling of an electron shell. As electrons are added, they occupy the lowest available shell. Hydrogen's 1 electron and helium's 2 electrons are located in the first shell. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell (the lowest available shell). The outermost energy level occupied by electrons is called the valence shell. Elements with the same number of valence electrons--fluorine and chlorine, for instance--have similar chemical properties.

Hydrogen's 1 electron and helium's 2 electrons are located in the first shell. Electrons, like all matter, tend to exist in the lowest available state of potential energy, which they have in the first shell. However, the first shell can hold no more than 2 electrons. An atom with more than 2 electrons must use higher shells because the first shell is full. The next element, lithium, has 3 electrons. Two of these electrons fill the first shell while the third electron occupies the second shell. The second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons. Neon, at the end of the second row, has 8 electrons in the second shell, giving it a total of 10 electrons.

The chemical behavior of an atom depends mostly on the number of electrons in its outermost shell. We refer to those outer electrons as valence electrons and to the outermost electron shell as the valence shell. In the case of lithium, there is only 1 valence electron, and the second shell is the valence shell. Atoms with the same number of electrons in their valence shells exhibit similar chemical behavior. For example, fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) both have 7 valence electrons, and both combine with the element sodium to form compounds (see FIGURE 2.2). An atom with a completed valence shell is unreactive; that is, it will not interact readily with other atoms it encounters. At the far right of the periodic table are helium, neon, and argon, the only three elements shown in FIGURE 2.10 that have full valence shells. These elements are said to be inert, meaning chemically unreactive. All the other atoms in FIGURE 2.10 are chemically reactive because they have incomplete valence shells.

Electron Orbitals

Early in the 20th century, the electron shells of an atom were visualized as concentric paths of electrons orbiting the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun. It is still convenient to use concentric-circle diagrams to symbolize electron shells, as in FIGURE 2.10. The atom is not this simple, however. In fact, we can never know the exact path of an electron. What we can do instead is describe the space in which an electron spends most of its time. The three-dimensional space where an electron is found 90%  of the time is called an orbital. Each electron shell consists of a specific number of orbitals of specific shapes (FIGURE 2.11).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 2-11. Electron orbitals. The three-dimensional shapes in the top half of this figure represent electron orbitals--the volumes of space where the electrons of an atom are most likely to be found. Each orbital holds a maximum of 2 electrons. The bottom half of the figure shows the equivalent electron-shell diagrams. (a) The first electron shell has one spherical (s) orbital, designated 1s. Only this orbital is occupied in hydrogen, which has 1 electron, and helium, which has 2 electrons. (b) The second and all higher shells each have one larger s orbital (designated 2s for the second shell) plus three dumbbell-shaped orbitals called p orbitals (2p for the second shell). The three 2p orbitals lie at right angles to one another along imaginary x, y, and z axes of the atom. (The third and higher electron shells can hold additional electrons in orbitals of more complex shapes.) (c) To symbolize the electron orbitals of the element neon, which has a total of 10 electrons, we superimpose the 1s orbital of the first shell and the 2s and three 2p orbitals of the second shell. (Each orbital, remember, can hold 2 electrons.)

No more than 2 electrons can occupy the same orbital. The first electron shell has a single orbital and can thereby accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons. This orbital, which is spherical in shape, is designated the 1s orbital. The lone electron of a hydrogen atom occupies the 1s orbital, as do the 2 electrons of a helium atom. The second electron shell has four orbitals and therefore can hold 8 electrons. Electrons in each of the four orbitals have nearly the same energy, but they move in different volumes of space. There is a 2s orbital, spherical in shape like the 1s orbital, but with a greater diameter. The other three orbitals, called 2p orbitals, are dumbbell-shaped. Each 2p orbital is oriented at right angles to the other two. (The third and higher electron shells also have s and p orbitals, as well as orbitals of more complex shapes.)

The reactivity of atoms arises from the presence of unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals of their valence shells. Recall that the electronic configurations in FIGURE 2.10 build up with the addition of 1 electron at a time. Like strangers getting on a bus with seats for two, each additional electron occupies a separate orbital until no empty orbitals remain in a shell. Only then do the orbitals begin to receive a second electron. The paired dots in FIGURE 2.10 represent paired electrons sharing an orbital. When atoms interact to complete their valence shells, it is the unpaired electrons that are involved.





 Atoms combine by chemical bonding to form molecules

Now that we have looked at the structure of atoms, we can move up in the hierarchy of organization and see how atoms combine to form molecules. Atoms with incomplete valence shells interact with certain other atoms in such a way that each partner completes its valence shell. Atoms do this by either sharing or transferring valence electrons. These interactions usually result in atoms staying close together, held by attractions called chemical bonds. The strongest kinds of chemical bonds are covalent bonds and ionic bonds.

Covalent Bonds

A covalent bond is the sharing of a pair of valence electrons by two atoms. For example, let's consider what happens when two hydrogen atoms approach each other. Recall that hydrogen has 1 valence electron in the first shell, but the shell's capacity is 2 electrons. When the two hydrogen atoms come close enough for their 1s orbitals to overlap, they share their electrons (FIGURE 2.12a). Each hydrogen atom now has 2 electrons associated with it in what amounts to a completed valence shell. Two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds constitute a molecule. In this case, we have formed a hydrogen molecule. We can abbreviate the structure of this molecule as H--H, where the line represents a covalent bond--that is, a pair of shared electrons. This notation, which represents both atoms and bonding, is called a structural formula. We can abbreviate even further by writing H2, a molecular formula indicating simply that the molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen.

Fig 2-12. Covalent bonding in four molecules. A single covalent bond consists of a pair of shared electrons. The number of electrons required to complete an atom's valence shell generally determines how many bonds that atom will form.

With 6 electrons in its second electron shell, oxygen needs 2 more electrons to complete its valence shell. Two oxygen atoms form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons (FIGURE 2.12b). The atoms are thus joined by what is called a double covalent bond.

Each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds the atom can form. When the bonds form, they give the atom a full complement of valence electrons. The bonding capacity of oxygen, for example, is 2. This bonding capacity is called the atom's valence and generally equals the number of unpaired electrons in the atom's outermost (valence) shell. You can readily determine the valences of life's most abundant elements from the electron configurations in FIGURE 2.10: The valence of hydrogen is 1; oxygen, 2; nitrogen, 3; and carbon, 4. One more complicated case is phosphorus (P), another element important to life. Phosphorus can have a valence of 3, as we would predict from its 3 unpaired electrons. In biologically important molecules, however, it generally has a valence of 5, forming three single bonds and one double bond.

The molecules H2 and O2 are pure elements, not compounds. (Recall that a compound is a combination of two or more different elements.) An example of a molecule that is a compound is water, with the molecular formula H2O. It takes two atoms of hydrogen to satisfy the valence of one oxygen atom. FIGURE 2.12c shows the structure of a water molecule. Water is so important to life that Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to its structure and behavior.

Another molecule that is a compound is methane, the main component of natural gas, with the molecular formula CH4 (FIGURE 2.12d). It takes four hydrogen atoms, each with a valence of 1, to complement one atom of carbon, with its valence of 4. We will look at many other compounds of carbon in Chapter 4.

Nonpolar and Polar Covalent Bonds. The attraction of an atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is called its electronegativity. The more electronegative an atom, the more strongly it pulls shared electrons toward itself. In a covalent bond between two atoms of the same element, the outcome of the tug-of-war for common electrons is a standoff; the two atoms are equally electronegative. Such a bond, in which the electrons are shared equally, is a nonpolar covalent bond. The covalent bond of H2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O2. The bonds of methane (CH4) are also nonpolar; although the partners are different elements, carbon and hydrogen do not differ substantially in electronegativity. In other compounds, however, where one atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond will not be shared equally. This sort of bond is called a polar covalent bond. For example, the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are polar (FIGURE 2.13). Oxygen is one of the most electronegative of the 92 elements, attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than they do near the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative charge, the unequal sharing of electrons in water causes the oxygen atom to have a partial negative charge and each hydrogen atom a partial positive charge.

Fig 2-13. Polar covalent bonds in a water molecule. Oxygen, being much more electronegative than hydrogen, pulls the shared electrons of the covalent bonds toward itself, as indicated by the arrows. This unequal sharing of electrons gives the oxygen a partial negative charge and the hydrogens a partial positive charge. The Greek symbol delta (d) indicates that the charges are less than full units. This "space-filling" model approximates the true shape of H2O.

Ionic Bonds

In some cases, two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for valence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips an electron completely away from its partner. This is what happens when an atom of sodium (11Na) encounters an atom of chlorine (17Cl) (FIGURE 2.14). A sodium atom has a total of 11 electrons, with its single valence electron in the third electron shell. A chlorine atom has a total of 17 electrons, with 7 electrons in its valence shell. When these two atoms meet, the lone valence electron of sodium is transferred to the chlorine atom, and both atoms end up with their valence shells complete. (Because sodium no longer has an electron in the third shell, the second shell is now the valence shell.)

Fig 2-14. Electron transfer and ionic bonding. A valence electron can be transferred from sodium (Na) to chlorine (Cl), giving both atoms completed valence shells. The electron transfer leaves the sodium atom with a net charge of +1 (cation) and the chlorine atom with a net charge of -1 (anion). The attraction between the oppositely charged atoms, or ions, is an ionic bond. Ions can bond not only to atoms with which they have reacted, but to any other ions of opposite charge.

The electron transfer between the two atoms moves one unit of negative charge from sodium to chlorine. Sodium, now with 11 protons but only 10 electrons, has a net electrical charge of +1. A charged atom (or molecule) is called an ion. When the charge is positive, the ion is specifically called a cation; the sodium atom has become a cation. Conversely, the chlorine atom, having gained an extra electron, now has 17 protons and 18 electrons, giving it a net electrical charge of -1. It has become a chloride ion--an anion, or negatively charged ion. Because of their opposite charges, cations and anions attract each other in what is called an ionic bond. Any two ions of opposite charge can form an ionic bond. The ions need not have acquired their charge by an electron transfer with each other.

Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called ionic compounds, or salts. We know the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl) as table salt (FIGURE 2.15). Salts are often found in nature as crystals of various sizes and shapes, each an aggregate of vast numbers of cations and anions bonded by their electrical attraction and arranged in a three-dimensional lattice. A salt crystal does not consist of molecules in the sense that a covalent compound does, because a covalently bonded molecule has a definite size and number of atoms. The formula for an ionic compound, such as NaCl, indicates only the ratio of elements in a crystal of the salt. "NaCl" is not a molecule.

Fig 2-15. A sodium chloride crystal. The sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-) are held together by ionic bonds. The formula NaCl tells us that the ratio of Na+ to Cl- is 1:1.

Not all salts have equal numbers of cations and anions. For example, the ionic compound magnesium chloride (MgCl2) has two chloride ions for each magnesium ion. Magnesium (12Mg) must lose 2 outer electrons if the atom is to have a complete valence shell, so it tends to become a cation with a net charge of +2 (Mg2+). One magnesium cation can therefore form ionic bonds with two chloride anions.

The term ion also applies to entire molecules that are electrically charged. In the salt ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), for instance, the anion is a single chloride ion (Cl-), but the cation is ammonium (NH4+), a nitrogen atom with four covalently bonded hydrogen atoms. The whole ammonium ion has an electrical charge of +1 because it is 1 electron short.

Environment affects the strength of ionic bonds. In a dry salt crystal, the bonds are so strong that it takes a hammer and chisel to break enough of them to crack the crystal in two. Place the same salt crystal in water, however, and the salt dissolves as the attractions between its ions decrease. In the next chapter, you will learn how water dissolves salts.





 Weak chemical bonds play important roles in the chemistry of life

In living organisms, most of the strongest chemical bonds are covalent ones, which link atoms to form a cell's molecules. But bonding between molecules is also indispensable in the cell, where the properties of life emerge from molecular interactions. When two molecules in the cell make contact, they may adhere temporarily by types of chemical bonds that are much weaker than covalent bonds. The advantage of weak bonding is that the contact between the molecules can be brief; the molecules come together, respond to one another in some way, and then separate.

The importance of weak bonding can be seen in the example of chemical signaling in the brain. One brain cell signals another by releasing molecules that use weak bonds to dock onto receptor molecules on the nearby surface of a receiving cell. The bonds last just long enough to trigger a momentary response by the receiving cell. If the signal molecules attached by stronger bonds, the receiving cell would continue to respond long after the transmitting cell ceased dispatching the message, with perhaps disastrous consequences. (Imagine what it would be like, for instance, if your brain continued to perceive the ringing sound of a bell for hours after nerve cells transmitted the information from the ears to the brain.)

Several types of weak chemical bonds are important in living organisms. One is the ionic bond, which is relatively weak in the presence of water. Another type of weak bond, crucial to life, is known as a hydrogen bond.

Hydrogen Bonds

Among the various kinds of weak chemical bonds, hydrogen bonds are so important in the chemistry of life that they deserve special attention. A hydrogen bond forms when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to one electronegative atom is also attracted to another electronegative atom. In living cells, the electronegative partners involved are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms.

Let's examine the simple case of hydrogen bonding between water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) (FIGURE 2.16). You have seen how the polar covalent bonds of water result in the oxygen atom having a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms having a partial positive charge. A similar situation arises in the ammonia molecule, where an electronegative nitrogen atom has a partial negative charge because of its pull on the electrons it shares covalently with hydrogen. If a water molecule and an ammonia molecule are close together, a weak attraction will occur between the negatively charged nitrogen atom and a positively charged hydrogen atom of the adjacent water molecule. This attraction is a hydrogen bond.

Fig 2-16. A hydrogen bond. Through a weak electrical attraction, a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to one electronegative atom weakly bonds to another electronegative atom.

Van der Waals Interactions

Even a molecule with nonpolar covalent bonds may have positively and negatively charged regions. Because electrons are in constant motion, they are not always symmetrically distributed in the molecule; at any instant, they may accumulate by chance in one part of the molecule or another. The results are ever-changing "hot spots" of positive and negative charge that enable all atoms and molecules to stick to one another. These van der Waals interactions are weak and occur only when atoms and molecules are very close together.

Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak bonds may form not only between molecules but also between different regions of a single large molecule, such as a protein. Although these bonds are individually weak, their cumulative effect is to reinforce the three-dimensional shape of a large molecule. You will learn more about the biological roles of weak bonds in Chapter 5.





 A molecule's biological function is related to its shape

A molecule has a characteristic size and shape. The precise shape of a molecule is usually very important to its function in the living cell.

A molecule consisting of two atoms, such as H2 or O2, is always linear, but molecules with more than two atoms have more complicated shapes. These shapes are determined by the positions of the atoms' orbitals. When an atom forms covalent bonds, the orbitals in its valence shell rearrange. For atoms with valence electrons in both s and p orbitals (see FIGURE 2.11), the single s and three p orbitals hybridize to form four new orbitals shaped like identical teardrops extending from the region of the atomic nucleus (FIGURE 2.17a). If we connect the larger ends of the teardrops with lines, we have the outline of a pyramidal shape called a tetrahedron.

Fig 2-17. Molecular shapes due to hybrid orbitals. (a) The single s and three p orbitals of a valence shell involved in covalent bonding combine to form four teardrop-shaped hybrid orbitals. These orbitals extend to the four corners of an imaginary tetrahedron (outlined in magenta). (b) Because of the positions of the hybrid orbitals, the two covalent bonds of water are angled at 104.5&#176;. This is seen most clearly in the ball-and-stick model. The space-filling model comes closer to the actual shape of the molecule. (c) The hydrogens of methane occupy all four corners of the tetrahedron, giving methane a tetrahedral shape.

For the water molecule (H2O), two of the hybrid orbitals in the oxygen atom's valence shell are shared with hydrogen atoms (FIGURE 2.17b). The result is a molecule shaped roughly like a V, its two covalent bonds spread apart at an angle of 104.5&#176;.

The methane molecule (CH4) has the shape of a completed tetrahedron, because all four hybrid orbitals of carbon are shared (FIGURE 2.17c). The nucleus of the carbon is at the center, with its four covalent bonds radiating to hydrogen nuclei at the corners of the tetrahedron. Larger molecules containing multiple carbon atoms, including many of the molecules that make up living matter, have more complex overall shapes. However, the tetrahedral shape of a carbon atom bonded to four other atoms is often a repeating motif within such molecules.

Molecular shape is crucial in biology because it determines how most biological molecules recognize and respond to one another. For instance, in the chemical signaling example mentioned earlier, the signal molecules released by the transmitting brain cell have a unique shape that specifically fits together with the shape of the receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell, much as a key fits into a lock (FIGURE 2.18). This complementarity of shape aids the formation of weak bonds between the two molecules. The attachment of the signal molecule to the receptor molecule stimulates activity in the receptor cell. Molecules with shapes similar to those of the brain's signal molecules can affect mood and pain perception. Morphine, heroin, and other opiate drugs, for example, mimic natural signal molecules called endorphins (FIGURE 2.19). These drugs produce euphoria and relieve pain by binding to endorphin receptors in the brain. The role of molecular shape in brain chemistry is an example of the relationship of structure to function, one of biology's unifying themes.

 Chemical reactions make and break chemical bonds

The making and breaking of chemical bonds, leading to changes in the composition of matter, are called chemical reactions. An example is the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water:





This reaction breaks the covalent bonds of H2 and O2 and forms the new bonds of H2O. When we write a chemical reaction, we use an arrow to indicate the conversion of the starting materials, called reactants, to the products. The coefficients indicate the number of molecules involved; for example, the 2 in front of the H2 means that the reaction starts with two molecules of hydrogen. Notice that all atoms of the reactants must be accounted for in the products. Matter is conserved in a chemical reaction: Reactions cannot create or destroy matter but can only rearrange it.

Photosynthesis, which takes place within the cells of green plant tissues, is a particularly important example of chemical reactions rearranging matter. Humans and other animals ultimately depend on photosynthesis for food and oxygen, and this process is at the foundation of almost all ecosystems. Following is the chemical shorthand that summarizes the process of photosynthesis:


The raw materials of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide (CO2), which is taken from the air, and water (H2O), which is absorbed from the soil. Within the plant cells, sunlight powers the conversion of these ingredients to a sugar called glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen molecules (O2), a by-product that the plant releases into the surroundings (FIGURE 2.20). Although photosynthesis is actually a sequence of many chemical reactions, we still end up with the same number and kinds of atoms we had when we started. Matter has simply been rearranged.

Fig 2-20. Photosynthesis: a solar-powered rearrangement of matter. This Elodea, a freshwater plant, produces sugar by rearranging the atoms of carbon dioxide and water in the chemical process known as photosynthesis. Sunlight powers this chemical transformation. Much of the sugar is then converted to other food molecules. Oxygen gas (O2) is a by-product of photosynthesis; notice the bubbles of oxygen escaping from the leaves in the photo.

Some chemical reactions go to completion; that is, all the reactants are converted to products. But most reactions are reversible, the products of the forward reaction becoming the reactants for the reverse reaction. For example, hydrogen and nitrogen molecules can combine to form ammonia, but ammonia can also decompose to regenerate hydrogen and nitrogen:

The opposite-headed arrows indicate that the reaction is reversible.

One of the factors affecting the rate of a reaction is the concentration of reactants. The greater the concentration of reactant molecules, the more frequently they collide with one another and have an opportunity to react to form products. The same holds true for the products. As products accumulate, collisions resulting in the reverse reaction become increasingly frequent. Eventually, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and the relative concentrations of products and reactants stop changing. The point at which the reactions offset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium. This is a dynamic equilibrium; reactions are still going on, but with no net effect on the concentrations of reactants and products. Equilibrium does not mean that the reactants and products are equal in concentration, but only that their concentrations have stabilized. The reaction involving ammonia reaches equilibrium when ammonia decomposes as rapidly as it forms. In this case, there is far more ammonia than hydrogen and nitrogen at equilibrium.

We will return to the subject of chemical reactions after more detailed study of the various types of molecules that are important to life. In the next chapter, we focus on water, the substance in which all the chemical processes of living organisms occur.

As astronomers study newly discovered planets orbiting distant stars, they hope to find evidence of water on these far-off worlds, for water is the substance that makes possible life as we know it here on Earth. All organisms familiar to us are made mostly of water and live in an environment dominated by water. Water is the biological medium here on Earth, and possibly on other planets as well.

Life on Earth began in water and evolved there for 3 billion years before spreading onto land. Modern life, even terrestrial (land-dwelling) life, remains tied to water. Most cells are surrounded by water, and cells themselves are about 70-95% water. Three-quarters of Earth's surface is submerged in water. Although most of this water is in liquid form, water is also present on Earth as ice and vapor. Water is the only common substance to exist in the natural environment in all three physical states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. These three states of water are visible in the photograph on this page, a view of Earth from space.

The abundance of water is a major reason Earth is habitable. In a classic book called The Fitness of the Environment, Lawrence Henderson highlights the importance of water to life. While acknowledging that life adapts to its environment through natural selection, Henderson emphasizes that for life to exist at all, the environment must first be a suitable abode. Your objective in this chapter is to develop a conceptual understanding of how water contributes to the fitness of Earth for life.

Water is so common that it is easy to overlook the fact that it is an exceptional substance with many extraordinary qualities. Following the theme of emergent properties, we can trace water's unique behavior to the structure and interactions of its molecules.





THE DISSOCIATION OF WATER MOLECULES

 

 Organisms are sensitive to changes in pH



 

 Acid precipitation threatens the fitness of the environment



Occasionally, a hydrogen atom shared by two water molecules in a hydrogen bond shifts from one molecule to the other. When this happens, the hydrogen atom leaves its electron behind, and what is actually transferred is a hydrogen ion, a single proton with a charge of +1. The water molecule that lost a proton is now a hydroxide ion (OH-), which has a charge of -1. The proton binds to the other water molecule, making that molecule a hydronium ion (H3O+). We can picture the chemical reaction this way:

Although this is what actually happens, we can think of the process in a simplified way, as the dissociation (separation) of a water molecule into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxide ion: 

As the double arrows indicate, this is a reversible reaction that will reach a state of dynamic equilibrium when water dissociates at the same rate that it is being re-formed from H+ and OH-. At this equilibrium point, the concentration of water molecules greatly exceeds the concentrations of H+ and OH-. In fact, in pure water, only one water molecule in every 554 million is dissociated. The concentration of each ion in pure water is 10-7M (at 25&#176;C). This means that there is only one ten-millionth of a mole of hydrogen ions per liter of pure water and an equal number of hydroxide ions.

Although the dissociation of water is reversible and statistically rare, it is exceedingly important in the chemistry of life. Hydrogen and hydroxide ions are very reactive. Changes in their concentrations can drastically affect a cell's proteins and other complex molecules. As we have seen, the concentrations of H+ and OH- are equal in pure water, but adding certain kinds of solutes, called acids and bases, disrupts this balance. Biologists use something called the pH scale to describe how acidic or basic (the opposite of acidic) a solution is. In the remainder of this chapter, you will learn about acids, bases, and pH and why changes in pH can adversely affect organisms.





 The polarity of water molecules results in hydrogen bonding

Studied in isolation, the water molecule is deceptively simple. Its two hydrogen atoms are joined to the oxygen atom by single covalent bonds. Because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, the electrons of the polar bonds spend more time closer to the oxygen atom. In other words, the bonds that hold together the atoms in a water molecule are polar covalent bonds, with the oxygen region of the molecule having a partial negative charge and the hydrogens having a partial positive charge. The water molecule, shaped something like a wide V, is a polar molecule, meaning that opposite ends of the molecule have opposite charges (see figure 2.13).

The anomalous properties of water arise from attractions between these polar molecules. The attraction is electrical; a slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule. The two molecules are thus held together by a hydrogen bond (FIGURE 3.1). Each water molecule can form hydrogen bonds to a maximum of four neighbors, and at any given moment, many of the molecules in a sample of liquid water are linked in this way. The extraordinary qualities of water are emergent properties resulting from the hydrogen bonding that orders molecules into a higher level of structural organization.

Fig 3-1. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The charged regions of a polar water molecule are attracted to oppositely charged parts of neighboring molecules. (The oxygen has a slight negative charge; the hydrogens have a slight positive charge.) Each molecule can hydrogen-bond to a maximum of four partners. At any instant in liquid water at 37&#176;C (human body temperature), about 15% of the molecules are bonded to four partners in short-lived clusters.

We will examine four of water's properties that contribute to the fitness of Earth as an environment for life: water's cohesive behavior, its ability to stabilize temperature, its expansion upon freezing, and its versatility as a solvent.





 Organisms depend on the cohesion of water molecules

Water molecules stick to each other as a result of hydrogen bonding. When water is in its liquid form, its hydrogen bonds are very fragile, about one-twentieth as strong as covalent bonds. They form, break, and re-form with great frequency. Each hydrogen bond lasts only a few trillionths of a second, but the molecules are constantly forming new bonds with a succession of partners. Thus, at any instant, a substantial percentage of all the water molecules are bonded to their neighbors, making water more structured than most other liquids. Collectively, the hydrogen bonds hold the substance together, a phenomenon called cohesion.

Cohesion due to hydrogen bonding contributes to the transport of water against gravity in plants. Water reaches the leaves through microscopic vessels that extend upward from the roots (FIGURE 3.2). Water that evaporates from a leaf is replaced by water from the vessels in the veins of the leaf. Hydrogen bonds cause water molecules leaving the veins to tug on molecules farther down in the vessel, and the upward pull is transmitted along the vessel all the way down to the roots. Adhesion, the clinging of one substance to another, also plays a role. Adhesion of water to the walls of the vessels helps counter the downward pull of gravity.

Fig 3-2. Water transport in plants. Evaporation from leaves pulls water upward from the roots through microscopic tubes called xylem vessels, in this case located in the trunk of a tree. Cohesion due to hydrogen bonding helps hold together the column of water within a vessel. Adhesion of the water to the vessel wall also helps in resisting the downward pull of gravity.

Related to cohesion is surface tension, a measure of how difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid. Water has a greater surface tension than most other liquids. At the interface between water and air is an ordered arrangement of water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to one another and to the water below. This makes the water behave as though coated with an invisible film. We can observe the surface tension of water by slightly overfilling a drinking glass; the water will stand above the rim. Water's surface tension also allows us to skip rocks on a pond. In a more biological example, some animals can stand, walk, or run on water without breaking the surface (FIGURE 3.3).

Fig 3-3. Walking on water. The high surface tension of water, resulting from the collective strength of its hydrogen bonds, allows the water strider to walk on a pond without breaking the surface.





 Water moderates temperatures on Earth

Water stabilizes air temperatures by absorbing heat from air that is warmer and releasing the stored heat to air that is cooler. Water is effective as a heat bank because it can absorb or release a relatively large amount of heat with only a slight change in its own temperature. To understand this quality of water, we must first look briefly at heat and temperature.

Heat and Temperature

Anything that moves has kinetic energy, the energy of motion. Atoms and molecules have kinetic energy because they are always moving, although not necessarily in any particular direction. The faster a molecule moves, the greater its kinetic energy. Heat is a measure of the total quantity of kinetic energy due to molecular motion in a body of matter. Temperature measures the intensity of heat due to the average kinetic energy of the molecules. When the average speed of the molecules increases, a thermometer records this as a rise in temperature. Heat and temperature are related, but they are not the same. A swimmer crossing the English Channel has a higher temperature than the water, but the ocean contains far more heat because of its volume.

Whenever two objects of different temperature are brought together, heat passes from the warmer to the cooler body until the two are the same temperature. Molecules in the cooler object speed up at the expense of the kinetic energy of the warmer object. An ice cube cools a drink not by adding coldness to the liquid, but by absorbing heat as the ice melts.

Throughout this book, we will use the Celsius scale to indicate temperature (Celsius degrees are abbreviated as &#176;C). At sea level, water freezes at 0&#176;C and boils at 100&#176;C. The temperature of the human body averages 37&#176;C, and comfortable room temperature is about 20-25&#176;C.

One convenient unit of heat used in this book is the calorie (cal). A calorie is the amount of heat energy it takes to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1&#176;C. Conversely, a calorie is also the amount of heat that 1 g of water releases when it cools by 1&#176;C. A kilocalorie (kcal), 1,000 cal, is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram (kg) of water by 1&#176;C. (The "calories" on food packages are actually kilocalories.) Another energy unit used in this book is the joule (J). One joule equals 0.239 cal; a calorie equals 4.184 J.

Water's High Specific Heat

The ability of water to stabilize temperature stems from its relatively high specific heat. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 g of that substance to change its temperature by 1&#176;C. We already know water's specific heat because we have defined a calorie as the amount of heat that causes 1 g of water to change its temperature by 1&#176;C. Therefore, the specific heat of water is 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius, abbreviated as 1 cal/g/&#176;C. Compared with most other substances, water has an unusually high specific heat. For example, ethyl alcohol, the type of alcohol in alcoholic beverages, has a specific heat of 0.6 cal/g/&#176;C.

Because of the high specific heat of water relative to other materials, water will change its temperature less when it absorbs or loses a given amount of heat. The reason you can burn your fingers by touching the metal handle of a pot on the stove when the water in the pot is still lukewarm is that the specific heat of water is ten times greater than that of iron. In other words, it will take only 0.1 cal to raise the temperature of 1 g of iron 1&#176;C. Specific heat can be thought of as a measure of how well a substance resists changing its temperature when it absorbs or releases heat. Water resists changing its temperature; when it does change its temperature, it absorbs or loses a relatively large quantity of heat for each degree of change.

We can trace water's high specific heat, like many of its other properties, to hydrogen bonding. Heat must be absorbed in order to break hydrogen bonds, and heat is released when hydrogen bonds form. A calorie of heat causes a relatively small change in the temperature of water because much of the heat energy is used to disrupt hydrogen bonds before the water molecules can begin moving faster. And when the temperature of water drops slightly, many additional hydrogen bonds form, releasing a considerable amount of energy in the form of heat.

What is the relevance of water's high specific heat to life on Earth? A large body of water can absorb and store a huge amount of heat from the sun in the daytime and during summer, while warming up only a few degrees. At night and during winter, the gradually cooling water can warm the air. This is the reason coastal areas generally have milder climates than inland regions. The high specific heat of water also tends to stabilize ocean temperatures, creating a favorable environment for marine life. Thus, because of its high specific heat, the water that covers most of Earth keeps temperature fluctuations on land and in water within limits that permit life. Also, because organisms are made primarily of water, they are more able to resist changes in their own temperatures than if they were made of a liquid with a lower specific heat.

Evaporative Cooling

Molecules of any liquid stay close together because they are attracted to one another. Molecules moving fast enough to overcome these attractions can depart the liquid and enter the air as gas. This transformation from a liquid to a gas is called vaporization, or evaporation. Recall that the speed of molecular movement varies and that temperature is the average kinetic energy of molecules. Even at low temperatures, the speediest molecules can escape into the air. Some evaporation occurs at any temperature; a glass of water, for example, will eventually evaporate at room temperature. If a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of molecules increases and the liquid evaporates more rapidly.

Heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted from the liquid to the gaseous state. Compared with most other liquids, water has a high heat of vaporization. To evaporate each gram of water at room temperature, about 580 cal of heat is needed-nearly double the amount needed to vaporize a gram of alcohol or ammonia. Water's high heat of vaporization is another emergent property caused by hydrogen bonds, which must be broken before the molecules can make their exodus from the liquid.

Water's high heat of vaporization helps moderate Earth's climate. A considerable amount of solar heat absorbed by tropical seas is consumed during the evaporation of surface water. Then, as moist tropical air circulates poleward, it releases heat as it condenses to form rain.

As a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down. This evaporative cooling occurs because the "hottest" molecules, those with the greatest kinetic energy, are the most likely to leave as gas. It is as if the 100 fastest runners at a college transferred to another school; the average speed of the remaining students would decline.

Evaporative cooling of water contributes to the stability of temperature in lakes and ponds and also provides a mechanism that prevents terrestrial organisms from overheating. For example, evaporation of water from the leaves of a plant helps keep the tissues in the leaves from becoming too warm in the sunlight. Evaporation of sweat from human skin dissipates body heat and helps prevent overheating on a hot day or when excess heat is generated by strenuous activity (FIGURE 3.4). High humidity on a hot day increases discomfort because the high concentration of water vapor in the air inhibits the evaporation of sweat from the body.

 Oceans and lakes don't freeze solid because ice floats

Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than as a liquid. In other words, ice floats. While other materials contract when they solidify, water expands. The cause of this exotic behavior is, once again, hydrogen bonding. At temperatures above 4&#176;C, water behaves like other liquids, expanding as it warms and contracting as it cools. Water begins to freeze when its molecules are no longer moving vigorously enough to break their hydrogen bonds. As the temperature reaches 0&#176;C, the water becomes locked into a crystalline lattice, each water molecule bonded to the maximum of four partners (FIGURE 3.5). The hydrogen bonds keep the molecules at "arm's length," far enough apart to make ice about 10% less dense (10% fewer molecules for the same volume) than liquid water at 4&#176;C. When ice absorbs enough heat for its temperature to rise above 0&#176;C, hydrogen bonds between molecules are disrupted. As the crystal collapses, the ice melts, and molecules are free to slip closer together. Water reaches its greatest density at 4&#176;C and then begins to expand as the molecules move faster. Keep in mind, however, that even in liquid water, many of the molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds, though only transiently: The hydrogen bonds are constantly breaking and reforming.

Fig 3-5. The structure of ice. In ice, each molecule is hydrogen-bonded to four neighbors in a three-dimensional crystal. Because the crystal is spacious, ice has fewer molecules than an equal volume of liquid water. In other words, ice is less dense than liquid water.

The ability of ice to float because of the expansion of water as it solidifies is an important factor in the fitness of the environment. If ice sank, then eventually all ponds, lakes, and even oceans would freeze solid, making life as we know it impossible on Earth. During summer, only the upper few inches of the ocean would thaw. Instead, when a deep body of water cools, the floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist under the frozen surface (FIGURE 3.6).

 Water is the solvent of life

A sugar cube placed in a glass of water will dissolve. The glass will then contain a uniform mixture of sugar and water; the concentration of dissolved sugar will be the same everywhere in the mixture. A liquid that is a completely homogeneous mixture of two or more substances is called a solution. The dissolving agent of a solution is the solvent, and the substance that is dissolved is the solute. In this case, water is the solvent and sugar is the solute. An aqueous solution is one in which water is the solvent.

The medieval alchemists tried to find a universal solvent, one that would dissolve anything. They learned that nothing works better than water. However, water is not a universal solvent; if it were, it could not be stored in any container, including our cells. But water is a very versatile solvent, a quality we can trace to the polarity of the water molecule.

Suppose, for example, that a crystal of the ionic compound sodium chloride is placed in water (FIGURE 3.7). At the surface of the crystal, the sodium and chloride ions are exposed to the solvent. These ions and the water molecules have a mutual affinity through electrical attraction. The oxygen regions of the water molecules are negatively charged and cling to sodium cations. The hydrogen regions of the water molecules are positively charged and are attracted to chloride anions. As a result, water molecules surround the individual sodium and chloride ions, separating and shielding them from one another. The sphere of water molecules around each dissolved ion is called a hydration shell. Working inward from the surface of the salt crystal, water eventually dissolves all the ions. The result is a solution of two solutes, sodium and chloride, homogeneously mixed with water, the solvent. Other ionic compounds also dissolve in water. Seawater, for instance, contains a great variety of dissolved ions, as do living cells.

Fig 3-7. A crystal of table salt dissolving in water. A sphere of water molecules, called a hydration shell, surrounds each solute ion.

A compound does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water; compounds made up of polar molecules, such as sugars, are also water-soluble. Such compounds dissolve when water molecules surround each of the solute molecules. Even molecules as large as proteins can dissolve in water if they have ionic and polar regions on their surface (FIGURE 3.8). Many different kinds of polar compounds are dissolved (along with ions) in the water of such biological fluids as blood, the sap of plants, and the liquid within all cells. Water is the solvent of life.

Fig 3-8. A water-soluble protein. Even a molecule as large as a protein can dissolve in water if it has enough ionic and polar regions on its surface. The mass of purple here represents a single such protein molecule, which is being surrounded by water molecules.

Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Substances

Whether ionic or polar, any substance that has an affinity for water is said to be hydrophilic (from the Greek hydro, water, and philios, loving). This term is used even if the substance does not dissolve-because the molecules are too large, for instance. Cotton, a plant product, is an example of a hydrophilic substance that absorbs water without dissolving. Cotton consists of giant molecules of cellulose, a compound with numerous regions of partial positive and partial negative charges associated with polar bonds. Water adheres to the cellulose fibers. Thus, a cotton towel does a great job of drying the body, yet does not dissolve in the washing machine. Cellulose is also present in the walls of water-conducting vessels in a plant; you read earlier how the adhesion of water to these hydrophilic walls functions in water transport.

There are, of course, substances that do not have an affinity for water. Substances that are non-ionic and nonpolar actually seem to repel water; these substances are termed hydrophobic (from the Greek phobos, fearing). An example from the kitchen is vegetable oil, which, as you know, does not mix stably with watery substances such as vinegar. The hydrophobic behavior of the oil molecules results from a prevalence of nonpolar bonds, in this case bonds between carbon and hydrogen, which share electrons almost equally. Hydrophobic molecules related to oils are major ingredients of cell membranes. (Imagine what would happen to a cell if its membrane dissolved.)

Solute Concentration in Aqueous Solutions

Biological chemistry is "wet" chemistry. Most of the chemical reactions that occur in organisms involve solutes dissolved in water. To carry out experiments on the chemistry of life, it is important to learn how to calculate the concentrations of solutes dissolved in aqueous solutions.

To understand chemical reactions, we need to know how many atoms and molecules are involved. Suppose we wanted to prepare an aqueous solution of table sugar having a specified concentration of sugar molecules (a certain number of solute molecules in a certain volume of solution). Because counting or weighing individual molecules is not practical, we usually measure substances in units called moles. A mole (mol) is equal in number to the molecular weight of a substance, but upscaled from daltons to units of grams. Imagine weighing out 1 mol of table sugar (sucrose), which has the molecular formula C12H22O11. In round numbers, a carbon atom weighs 12 daltons, a hydrogen atom weighs 1 dalton, and an oxygen atom weighs 16 daltons. Molecular weight is the sum of the weights of all the atoms in a molecule; thus, the molecular weight of sucrose is 342 daltons. To obtain 1 mol of sucrose, we weigh out 342 g, the molecular weight of sucrose expressed in grams.

The practical advantage of measuring a quantity of chemicals in moles is that a mole of one substance has exactly the same number of molecules as a mole of any other substance. If substance A has a molecular weight of 10 daltons and substance B has a molecular weight of 100 daltons, then 10 g of A will have the same number of molecules as 100 g of B. The number of molecules in a mole, called Avogadro's number, is 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023. A mole of table sugar contains 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023 sucrose molecules and weighs 342 g. A mole of ethyl alcohol (C2H6O) also contains 6.02 &#160;X&#160; 1023 molecules, but it weighs only 46 g because the molecules are smaller than those of sucrose. Measuring in moles makes it convenient for scientists working in the laboratory to combine substances in fixed ratios of molecules.

How would we make a liter (L) of solution consisting of 1 mol of sucrose dissolved in water? We would weigh out 342 g of sucrose and then gradually add water, while stirring, until the sugar was completely dissolved. We would then add enough water to bring the total volume of the solution up to 1 L. At that point, we would have a 1-molar (1 M) solution of sucrose. Molarity-the number of moles of solute per liter of solution-is the unit of concentration most often used by biologists for aqueous solutions.





 Organisms are sensitive to changes in pH

Before discussing the pH scale, let's see what acids and bases are and how they interact with water.

Acids and Bases

What would cause an aqueous solution to have an imbalance in its H+ and OH- concentrations? When the substances called acids dissolve in water, they donate additional H1 to the solution. An acid, according to the definition most often used by biologists, is a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to water, hydrogen ions dissociate from chloride ions: 

This additional source of H+ (dissociation of water is the other source) results in the solution having more H+ than OH-. Such a solution is known as an acidic solution.

A substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is called a base. Some bases reduce the H+ concentration directly by accepting hydrogen ions. Ammonia (NH3), for instance, acts as a base when the unshared electron pair in nitrogen's valence shell attracts a hydrogen ion from the solution, resulting in an ammonium ion (NH4+):

Other bases reduce the H+ concentration indirectly by dissociating to form hydroxide ions, which then combine with hydrogen ions in the solution to form water. One base that acts this way is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which in water dissociates into its ions:  In either case, the base reduces the H+ concentration. Solutions with a higher concentration of OH- than H+ are known as basic solutions. A solution in which the H+ and OH- concentrations are equal is said to be neutral.

Notice that single arrows were used in the reactions for HCl and NaOH. These compounds dissociate completely when mixed with water. Hydrochloric acid is called a strong acid and sodium hydroxide a strong base because they dissociate completely. In contrast, ammonia is a relatively weak base. The double arrows in the reaction for ammonia indicate that the binding and release of the hydrogen ion are reversible, although at equilibrium there will be a fixed ratio of NH4+ to NH3.

There are also weak acids, which reversibly release and reaccept hydrogen ions. An example is carbonic acid, which has essential functions in many organisms:  Here the equilibrium so favors the reaction in the left direction that when carbonic acid is added to water, only 1% of the molecules are dissociated at any particular time. Still, that is enough to shift the balance of H+ and OH- from neutrality.

The pH Scale

In any solution, the product of the H+ and OH- concentrations is constant at 10-14. This can be written  In such an equation, brackets indicate molar concentration for the substance enclosed within them. In a neutral solution at room temperature (25&#176;C), [H+] = 10-7 and [OH-] = 10-7, so in this case, 10-14 is the product of 10-7&#160;X&#160; 10-7. If enough acid is added to a solution to increase [H+] to 10-5M, then [OH-] will decline by an equivalent amount to 10-9M (note that 10-5&#160;X&#160; 10-9 = 10-14). This constant relationship expresses the behavior of acids and bases in a solution. An acid not only adds hydrogen ions to a solution, but also removes hydroxide ions because of the tendency for H+ to combine with OH- to form water. A base has the opposite effect, increasing OH- concentration but also reducing H+ concentration by the formation of water. If enough of a base is added to raise the OH- concentration to 10-4M, the H+ concentration will drop to 10-10M. Whenever we know the concentration of either H+ or OH- in a solution, we can deduce the concentration of the other ion.

Because the H+ and OH- concentrations of solutions can vary by a factor of 100 trillion or more, scientists have developed a way to express this variation more conveniently than in moles per liter. The pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14 (FIGURE 3.9), compresses the range of H+ and OH- concentrations by employing logarithms. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration:

For a neutral solution, [H+] is 10-7M, giving us 

Notice that pH declines as H+ concentration increases. Notice, too, that although the pH scale is based on H+ concentration, it also implies OH- concentration. A solution of pH 10 has a hydrogen ion concentration of 10-10M and a hydroxide ion concentration of 10-4M.

The pH of a neutral solution is 7, the midpoint of the scale. A pH value less than 7 denotes an acidic solution; the lower the number, the more acidic the solution. The pH for basic solutions is above 7. Most biological fluids are within the range pH 6 to pH 8. There are a few exceptions, however, including the strongly acidic digestive juice of the human stomach, which has a pH of about 2.

It is important to remember that each pH unit represents a tenfold difference in H+ and OH- concentrations. It is this mathematical feature that makes the pH scale so compact. A solution of pH 3 is not twice as acidic as a solution of pH 6, but a thousand times more acidic. When the pH of a solution changes slightly, the actual concentrations of H+ and OH- in the solution change substantially.

Buffers

The internal pH of most living cells is close to 7. Even a slight change in pH can be harmful, because the chemical processes of the cell are very sensitive to the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions.

Thanks to the presence of buffers, biological fluids resist changes to their own pH when acids or bases are introduced. Buffers are substances that minimize changes in the concentrations of H+ and OH- in a solution. For example, buffers normally maintain the pH of human blood very close to 7.4. A person cannot survive for more than a few minutes if the blood pH drops to 7 or rises to 7.8. Under normal circumstances, the buffering capacity of the blood prevents such swings in pH.

A buffer works by accepting hydrogen ions from the solution when they are in excess and donating hydrogen ions to the solution when they have been depleted. Most buffer solutions contain a weak acid and its corresponding base, which combine reversibly with hydrogen ions. One of the buffers that contribute to pH stability in human blood and many other biological solutions is carbonic acid (H2CO3), which, as already mentioned, dissociates to yield a bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and a hydrogen ion (H+): 

The chemical equilibrium between carbonic acid and bicarbonate acts as a pH regulator, the reaction shifting left or right as other processes in the solution add or remove hydrogen ions. If the H+ concentration in blood begins to fall (that is, if pH rises), more carbonic acid dissociates, replenishing hydrogen ions. But when H+ concentration in blood begins to rise (pH drops), the bicarbonate ion acts as a base and removes the excess hydrogen ions from the solution. Thus, the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffering system consists of an acid and a base in equilibrium with each other. Most other buffers are also acid-base pairs.





 Acid precipitation threatens the fitness of the environment

Considering the dependence of all life on water, contamination of rivers, lakes, and seas is a dire environmental problem. One of the most serious assaults on water quality is acid precipitation.

Uncontaminated rain has a pH of about 5.6, slightly acidic, owing to the formation of carbonic acid from carbon dioxide and water. Acid precipitation refers to rain, snow, or fog that is more acidic than pH 5.6. What causes acid precipitation, and what are its effects on the fitness of the environment?

Acid precipitation is caused primarily by the presence in the atmosphere of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, gaseous compounds that react with water in the air to form strong acids, which fall to earth with rain or snow. A major source of these oxides is the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) in factories and automobiles. Electrical power plants that burn coal produce more of these pollutants than any other single source. Ironically, the tall smokestacks built to reduce local pollution by dispersing factory exhaust help spread airborne pollutants. Winds carry the pollutants away, and acid rain may fall thousands of miles away from industrial centers. In the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, the pH of rainfall averages 4.2, about 25 times more acidic than normal rain. Acid precipitation falls on many other regions, including the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest and certain parts of Europe and Asia. One West Virginia storm dropped rain having a pH of 1.5, as acidic as the digestive juices in our stomachs!

The effect of acids in lakes and streams is most pronounced in the spring, as snow begins to melt. The surface snow melts first, drains down, and sends much of the acid that has accumulated over the winter into lakes and streams all at once. Early meltwater often has a pH as low as 3, and this acid surge hits when fish and other forms of aquatic life are producing eggs and young, which are especially vulnerable to acidic conditions. Strong acidity can alter the structure of biological molecules and prevent them from carrying out the essential chemical processes of life.

Although acid precipitation can clearly damage life in lakes and streams, its direct effects on forests and other terrestrial life are controversial. However, recent research indicates that acid rain and snow can bring about profound changes in soils by affecting the solubility of soil minerals. Acid precipitation falling on land washes away certain mineral ions, such as calcium and magnesium ions, that ordinarily help buffer the soil solution and are essential nutrients for plant growth. At the same time, other minerals, such as aluminum, reach toxic concentrations when acidification increases their solubility. The effects of acid precipitation on soil chemistry have contributed to the decline of European forests and are taking a toll on some North American forests (FIGURE 3.10). Nevertheless, studies indicate that the majority of North American forests are not currently suffering substantially from acid precipitation.

Fig 3-10. The effects of acid precipitation on a forest. Acid fog and acid rain are thought to be responsible for directly or indirectly killing many of the trees on Mount Mitchell, in North Carolina.

If there is reason for optimism about the future quality of water resources, it is our progress in reducing certain kinds of pollution. For example, in the United States, Canada, and Europe, emissions of sulfur oxides have declined markedly in recent decades, causing a decrease in acid precipitation. Continued progress can come only from the actions of people who are concerned about environmental quality. An essential part of their education is to understand the crucial role that water plays in the environment's fitness for continued life on Earth.

   The chemical elements of life: a review

Although water is the universal medium for life on Earth, most of the chemicals that make up living organisms are based on the element carbon. Of all chemical elements, carbon is unparalleled in its ability to form molecules that are large, complex, and diverse, and this molecular diversity has made possible the diversity of organisms that have evolved on Earth. The protein shown in the computer graphic image above is an example of a large, complex molecule based on carbon (the green atoms). Proteins are a major topic of Chapter 5. In this chapter, we focus on smaller molecules, using them to illustrate a few concepts of molecular architecture that highlight carbon's importance to life and the theme that emergent properties arise from the organization of the matter of living organisms.





THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON

 Carbon atoms are the most versatile building blocks of molecules



 

 Variation in carbon skeletons contributes to the diversity of organic molecules



Although a cell is composed of 70-95%  water, the rest consists mostly of carbon-based compounds. Proteins, DNA, carbohydrates, and other molecules that distinguish living matter from inanimate material are all composed of carbon atoms bonded to one another and to atoms of other elements. Hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P) are other common ingredients of these compounds, but it is carbon (C) that accounts for the large diversity of biological molecules.

 The chemical elements of life: a review



The distinctive properties of an organic molecule depend not only on the arrangement of its carbon skeleton, but also on the molecular components attached to that skeleton. We will now examine certain groups of atoms that are frequently attached to the skeletons of organic molecules.





 Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds

Compounds containing carbon are said to be organic, and the branch of chemistry that specializes in the study of carbon compounds is called organic chemistry. Once thought to come only from living things, organic compounds range from simple molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), to colossal ones, such as proteins, with thousands of atoms and molecular weights in excess of 100,000 daltons. Most organic compounds contain hydrogen atoms.

The overall percentages of the major elements of life--C, H, O, N, S, and P--are quite uniform from one organism to another. Because of carbon's versatility, however, this limited assortment of atomic building blocks, taken in roughly the same proportions, can be used to build an inexhaustible variety of organic molecules. Different species of organisms, and different individuals within a species, are distinguished by variations in their organic molecules.

Since the dawn of human history, people have used other organisms as sources of valued substances--from foods to medicines and fabrics. The science of organic chemistry originated in attempts to purify and improve the yield of such products. By the early 19th century, chemists had learned to make many simple compounds in the laboratory by combining elements under the right conditions. Artificial synthesis of the complex molecules extracted from living matter seemed impossible, however. It was at that time that the Swedish chemist J&ouml;ns Jakob Berzelius first made the distinction between organic compounds, those that seemingly could arise only within living organisms, and inorganic compounds, those that were found in the nonliving world. The new discipline of organic chemistry was first built on a foundation of vitalism, the belief in a life force outside the jurisdiction of physical and chemical laws.

Chemists began to chip away at the foundation of vitalism when they learned to synthesize organic compounds in their laboratories. In 1828, Friedrich W&ouml;hler, a German chemist who had studied with Berzelius, attempted to make an inorganic salt, ammonium cyanate, by mixing solutions of ammonium (NH4+) and cyanate (CNO-) ions. W&ouml;hler was astonished to find that instead of the expected product, he had made urea, an organic compound present in the urine of animals. W&ouml;hler challenged the vitalists when he wrote, "I must tell you that I can prepare urea without requiring a kidney or an animal, either man or dog." However, one of the ingredients used in the synthesis, the cyanate, had been extracted from animal blood, and the vitalists were not swayed by W&ouml;hler's discovery. However, a few years later, Hermann Kolbe, a student of W&ouml;hler's, made the organic compound acetic acid from inorganic substances that could themselves be prepared directly from pure elements.

The foundation of vitalism finally crumbled after several more decades of laboratory synthesis of increasingly complex organic compounds. In 1953, Stanley Miller, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, helped bring this abiotic (nonliving) synthesis of organic compounds into the context of evolution. Miller used a laboratory simulation of chemical conditions on the primitive Earth to demonstrate that the spontaneous synthesis of organic compounds could have been an early stage in the origin of life (FIGURE 4.1).

Fig 4-1. Abiotic synthesis of organic compounds under "early Earth" conditions. Here Stanley Miller re-creates his 1953 experiment, a laboratory simulation demonstrating that environmental conditions on the lifeless, primordial Earth allowed the spontaneous synthesis of some organic molecules. Miller used electrical discharges (simulated lightning) to trigger reactions in a primitive "atmosphere" of H2O, H2, NH3 (ammonia), and CH4 (methane)--some of the gases released by volcanoes. From these ingredients, Miller's apparatus made a variety of organic compounds that play key roles in living cells. Similar chemical reactions may have set the stage for the origin of life on Earth, a hypothesis we will explore in more detail in Chapter 26.

The pioneers of organic chemistry helped shift the mainstream of biological thought from vitalism to mechanism, the belief that all natural phenomena, including the processes of life, are governed by physical and chemical laws. Organic chemistry was redefined as the study of carbon compounds, regardless of their origin. Most naturally occurring organic compounds are produced by organisms, and these molecules represent a diversity and range of complexity unrivaled by inorganic compounds. However, the same rules of chemistry apply to inorganic and organic molecules alike. The foundation of organic chemistry is not some intangible life force, but the unique chemical versatility of the element carbon.





 Carbon atoms are the most versatile building blocks of molecules

The key to the chemical characteristics of an atom, as you learned in Chapter 2, is in its configuration of electrons, because electron configuration determines the kinds and number of bonds an atom will form with other atoms. Carbon has a total of 6 electrons, with 2 in the first electron shell and 4 in the second shell. Having 4 valence electrons in a shell that holds 8, carbon has little tendency to gain or lose electrons and form ionic bonds; it would have to donate or accept 4 electrons to do so. Instead, a carbon atom usually completes its valence shell by sharing electrons with other atoms in four covalent bonds. Each carbon atom thus acts as an intersection point from which a molecule can branch off in up to four directions. This tetravalence is one facet of carbon's versatility that makes large, complex molecules possible.

In Chapter 2, you also learned that when a carbon atom forms single covalent bonds, the arrangement of its four hybrid orbitals causes the bonds to angle toward the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron (see FIGURE 2.15c). The bond angles in methane (CH4) are 109&#176; (FIGURE 4.2a, p. 54), and they are approximately the same in any group of atoms where carbon has four single bonds. For example, ethane (C2H6) is shaped like two tetrahedrons joined at their apexes (FIGURE 4.2b). In molecules with still more carbons, every grouping of a carbon bonded to four other atoms has a tetrahedral shape. But when two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, all bonds around those carbons are in the same plane. For example, ethene is a flat molecule; its atoms all lie in the same plane (FIGURE 4.2c). It is convenient to write all structural formulas as though the molecules represented were flat, but it is important to remember that molecules are three-dimensional and that the shape of a molecule often determines its function.

The electron configuration of carbon gives it covalent compatibility with many different elements. FIGURE 4.3 reviews the valences of the four major atomic components of organic molecules: carbon and its most frequent partners--oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. We can think of these valences as the rules of covalent bonding in organic chemistry--the building code that governs the architecture of organic molecules.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 4-3. Valences for the major elements of organic molecules. Valence is the number of covalent bonds an atom will usually form. It is generally equal to the number of electrons required to complete the atom's outermost (valence) electron shell.

A couple of additional examples will show how the rules of covalent bonding apply to carbon atoms with partners other than hydrogen. In the carbon dioxide molecule (CO2), a single carbon atom is joined to two atoms of oxygen by double covalent bonds. The structural formula for CO2 is OCO. Each line (bond) in a structural formula represents a pair of shared electrons. Notice that the carbon atom in CO2 is involved in four covalent bonds, two with each oxygen atom. The arrangement completes the valence shells of all atoms in the molecule. Because carbon dioxide is a very simple molecule and lacks hydrogen, it is often considered inorganic, even though it contains carbon. Whether we call CO2 organic or inorganic is an arbitrary distinction, but there is no ambiguity about its importance to the living world. Taken from the air by plants and incorporated into sugar and other foods during photosynthesis, CO2 is the source of carbon for all the organic molecules found in organisms.

Another relatively simple molecule is urea, CO(NH2)2. This is the organic compound found in urine that W&ouml;hler learned to synthesize in the early 19th century. The structural formula for urea is shown on the following page.
Again, each atom has the required number of covalent bonds. In this case, one carbon atom is involved in both single and double bonds.

Both urea and carbon dioxide are molecules with only one carbon atom. But as FIGURE 4.2 shows, a carbon atom can also use one or more of its valence electrons to form covalent bonds to other carbon atoms, making it possible to link the atoms into chains of seemingly infinite variety.





 Variation in carbon skeletons contributes to the diversity of organic molecules

Carbon chains form the skeletons of most organic molecules. The skeletons vary in length and may be straight, branched, or arranged in closed rings (FIGURE 4.4). Some carbon skeletons have double bonds, which vary in number and location. Such variation in carbon skeletons is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that characterize living matter. In addition, atoms of other elements can be bonded to the skeletons at available sites.

Fig 4-4. Variations in carbon skeletons. Hydrocarbons, organic molecules consisting only of carbon and hydrogen, illustrate the diversity of the carbon skeletons of organic molecules.

All the molecules shown in FIGURE 4.2 and 4.4 are hydrocarbons, organic molecules consisting only of carbon and hydrogen. Atoms of hydrogen are attached to the carbon skeleton wherever electrons are available for covalent bonding. Hydrocarbons are the major components of petroleum, which is called a fossil fuel because it consists of the partially decomposed remains of organisms that lived millions of years ago.

Although hydrocarbons are not prevalent in living organisms, many of a cell's organic molecules have regions consisting of only carbon and hydrogen. For example, the molecules known as fats have long hydrocarbon tails attached to a nonhydrocarbon component (FIGURE 4.5). Neither petroleum nor fat mixes with water; both are hydrophobic compounds because the bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms are nonpolar. Another characteristic of hydrocarbons is that they store a relatively large amount of energy. The gasoline that fuels a car consists of hydrocarbons, and the hydrocarbon tails of fat molecules serve as stored fuel for animal bodies.

(Black = carbon; gray = hydrogen; red = oxygen) (b) Mammalian adipose cells stockpile fat molecules as a fuel reserve. Each adipose cell in this micrograph is almost filled by a large fat droplet, which stockpiles a huge number of fat molecules.

Isomers

Variation in the architecture of organic molecules can be seen in isomers, compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures and hence different properties. Compare, for example, the two butanes in FIGURE 4.4b. Both have the molecular formula C4H10, but they differ in the covalent arrangement of their carbon skeletons. The skeleton is straight in butane, but branched in isobutane. We will examine three types of isomers: structural isomers, geometric isomers, and enantiomers (FIGURE 4.6).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 4-6. Three types of isomers. Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures, isomers are a source of diversity in organic molecules.

Structural isomers differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms. The number of possible isomers increases tremendously as carbon skeletons increase in size. There are only two butanes, but there are 18 variations of C8H18 and 366,319 possible structural isomers of C20H42. Structural isomers may also differ in the location of double bonds.

Geometric isomers have the same covalent partnerships, but they differ in their spatial arrangements. Geometric isomers arise from the inflexibility of double bonds, which, unlike single bonds, will not allow the atoms they join to rotate freely about the bond axis. The subtle difference in shape between geometric isomers can dramatically affect the biological activities of organic molecules. For example, the biochemistry of vision involves a light-induced change of rhodopsin, a chemical compound in the eye, from one geometric isomer to another.

Enantiomers are molecules that are mirror images of each other. In the ball-and-stick models shown in FIGURE 4.6c, the middle carbon is called an asymmetric carbon because it is attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms. The four groups can be arranged in space about the asymmetric carbon in two different ways that are mirror images. They are, in a way, left-handed and right-handed versions of the molecule. A cell can distinguish these isomers based on their different shapes. Usually, one isomer is biologically active and the other is inactive.

The concept of enantiomers is important in the pharmaceutical industry because the two enantiomers of a drug may not be equally effective (FIGURE 4.7). In some cases, one of the isomers may even produce harmful effects. This was the case with thalidomide, a drug prescribed for thousands of pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The drug was a mixture of two enantiomers. One enantiomer reduced morning sickness, the desired effect, but the other caused severe birth defects. (And unfortunately, even if the "good" thalidomide enantiomer is used in purified form, some of it soon converts to the "bad" enantiomer in the patient's body.) The differing effects of enantiomers in the body demonstrate that organisms are sensitive to even the most subtle variations in molecular architecture. Once again, we see that molecules have emergent properties that depend on the specific arrangement of their atoms.

 Functional groups contribute to the molecular diversity of life

The components of organic molecules that are most commonly involved in chemical reactions are known as functional groups. If we think of hydrocarbons as the simplest organic molecules, we can view functional groups as attachments that replace one or more of the hydrogens bonded to the carbon skeleton of the hydrocarbon. (However, some functional groups include atoms of the carbon skeleton, as we will see.)

Each functional group behaves consistently from one organic molecule to another, and the number and arrangement of the groups help give each molecule its unique properties. Consider the differences between testosterone and estradiol (a type of estrogen). These compounds are male and female sex hormones, respectively, in humans and other vertebrates (FIGURE 4.8). Both are steroids, organic molecules with a common carbon skeleton in the form of four fused rings. These sex hormones differ mainly in the functional groups attached to the rings. The different actions of these two molecules on many targets throughout the body help produce the contrasting features of females and males. Thus, even our sexuality has its biological basis in variations of molecular architecture.

Fig 4-8. A comparison of functional groups of female (estradiol) and male (testosterone) sex hormones. The two molecules differ mainly in the attachment of functional groups to a common carbon skeleton of four fused rings. (The carbon skeleton has been simplified here by omitting the carbons in the rings, as well as their hydrogens.) These subtle variations in molecular architecture influence the development of the anatomical and physiological differences between female and male vertebrates.

The six functional groups most important in the chemistry of life are the hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups (TABLE 4.1, p. 58). All are hydrophilic and thus increase the solubility of organic compounds in water.

Table 4-1. Functional Groups of Organic Compounds

Functional GroupFormulaName of CompoundsExampleHydroxylAlcoholsCarbonylAldehydesKetonesCarboxylCarboxylic acidsAminoAminesSulfhydrylThiolsPhosphateOrganic phosphatesThe ionized forms of the carboxyl and amino groups prevail in cells. However, acetic acid and glycine are represented here in their non-ionized forms.The Hydroxyl Group

In a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom is bonded to an oxygen atom, which in turn is bonded to the carbon skeleton of the organic molecule. Organic compounds containing hydroxyl groups are called alcohols, and their specific names usually end in -ol, as in ethanol, the drug present in alcoholic beverages. In a structural formula, the hydroxyl group is usually abbreviated by omission of the covalent bond between the oxygen and hydrogen and is written as--OH or HO--. (Do not confuse this functional group with the hydroxide ion, OH-, formed by the dissociation of bases such as sodium hydroxide.) The hydroxyl group is polar as a result of the electronegative oxygen atom drawing electrons toward itself. Consequently, water molecules are attracted to the hydroxyl group, and this helps dissolve organic compounds containing such groups. Sugars, for example, owe their solubility in water to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (see FIGURE 5.3).

The Carbonyl Group

The carbonyl group () consists of a carbon atom joined to an oxygen atom by a double bond. If the carbonyl group is on the end of a carbon skeleton, the organic compound is called an aldehyde; otherwise the compound is called a ketone. The simplest ketone is acetone, which is three carbons long (see TABLE 4.1). Acetone has different properties from propanal, a three-carbon aldehyde. (Acetone and propanal are structural isomers.) Thus, variation in locations of functional groups along carbon skeletons is a major source of molecular diversity.

The Carboxyl Group

When an oxygen atom is double-bonded to a carbon atom that is also bonded to a hydroxyl group, the entire assembly of atoms is called a carboxyl group (--COOH). Compounds containing carboxyl groups are known as carboxylic acids, or organic acids. The simplest is the one-carbon compound called formic acid (HCOOH), the substance some ants inject when they sting. Acetic acid, which has two carbons, gives vinegar its sour taste. (In general, acids taste sour.)

Why does a carboxyl group have acidic properties? A carboxyl group is a source of hydrogen ions. The covalent bond between the oxygen and the hydrogen is so polar that the hydrogen tends to dissociate reversibly from the molecule as an ion (H+). In the case of acetic acid, we have 
Dissociation occurs as a result of the two electronegative oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group pulling shared electrons away from hydrogen. If the double-bonded oxygen and the hydroxyl group were attached to separate carbon atoms, there would be less tendency for the --OH group to dissociate because the second oxygen would be farther away. Here is another example of how emergent properties result from a specific arrangement of building components.

The Amino Group

The amino group (--NH2) consists of a nitrogen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms and to the carbon skeleton. Organic compounds with this functional group are called amines. An example is glycine, illustrated in TABLE 4.1. Because glycine also has a carboxyl group, it is both an amine and a carboxylic acid. Most of the cell's organic compounds have two or more different functional groups. Glycine and similar compounds having both amino and carboxyl groups are called amino acids; these are the molecular building blocks of proteins.

The amino group acts as a base. You learned in Chapter 3 that ammonia (NH3) can pick up a proton from the surrounding solution. Amino groups of organic compounds can do the same: 
This process gives the amino group a charge of +1, its most common state within the cell.

The Sulfhydryl Group

Sulfur is directly below oxygen in the periodic table; both have 6 valence electrons and form two covalent bonds. The organic functional group known as the sulfhydryl group (--SH), which consists of a sulfur atom bonded to an atom of hydrogen, resembles a hydroxyl group in shape (see TABLE 4.1). Organic compounds containing sulfhydryls are called thiols. In Chapter 5, you will learn how sulfhydryl groups can interact to help stabilize the intricate structure of a protein.

The Phosphate Group

Phosphate is an anion formed by dissociation of an inorganic acid called phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The loss of hydrogen ions by dissociation leaves the phosphate with two negative charges. Organic compounds containing a phosphate group () have a phosphate ion covalently attached by one of its oxygen atoms to the carbon skeleton (see TABLE 4.1). One function of phosphate groups is the transfer of energy between organic molecules. In Chapter 6, you will learn how cells harness the transfer of phosphate groups to perform work, such as the contraction of muscle cells.





 The chemical elements of life: a review

Living matter, as you have learned, consists mainly of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, with smaller amounts of sulfur and phosphorus. These elements share the characteristic of forming strong covalent bonds, a quality that is essential in the architecture of complex organic molecules. Of all these elements, carbon is the virtuoso of the covalent bond. The chemical behavior of carbon makes it exceptionally versatile as a building block in molecular architecture: It can form four covalent bonds, link together into intricate molecular skeletons, and join with several other elements. The versatility of carbon makes possible the great diversity of organic molecules, each with special properties that emerge from the unique arrangement of its carbon skeleton and the functional groups appended to that skeleton. At the foundation of all biological diversity lies this variation at the molecular level.

Now that we have examined the basic architectural principles of organic compounds, we can move on to the next chapter, where we will explore the specific structures and functions of the large and complex molecules made by living cells: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

   A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides

   Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix

   We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution

We have applied the concept of emergent properties to our study of water and relatively simple organic molecules. These substances are central to life, each one having unique behavior arising from the orderly arrangement of its atoms. Another level in the hierarchy of biological organization is reached when cells join small organic molecules together to form larger molecules. The four main classes of large biological molecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Many of these cellular molecules are, on the molecular scale, huge. For example, a protein may consist of thousands of covalently connected atoms that form a molecular colossus weighing over 100,000 daltons. Biologists use the term macromolecule for such giant molecules.

Considering the size and complexity of macromolecules, it is remarkable that biochemists have determined the detailed structures of so many of them (FIGURE 5.1). The architecture of a macromolecule helps explain how that molecule works. For example, the pleated structure of the silk protein from which the orb spider in the photo on this page weaves its web gives the fibers their strength and springiness. Proteins and the other large molecules of life are the main subject of this chapter. For these molecules, as at all levels in the biological hierarchy, form and function are inseparable.

In the 1950s, Pauling discovered several of the basic structural features of proteins, which he demonstrated by building physical models. (b) Today, scientists use computers to help build molecular models, but the goal remains the same: to correlate the structure of macromolecules with their functions.





POLYMER PRINCIPLES

 

 Most macromolecules are polymers



 

 An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers



In examining the relationship between the structure and function of life's macromolecules, we begin with a key generalization about how cells build these large molecules from smaller ones.





CARBOHYDRATES--FUEL AND BUILDING MATERIAL

 

 Sugars, the smallest carbohydrates, serve as fuel and carbon sources



 

 Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles



Carbohydrates include both sugars and their polymers. The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, or single sugars, also known as simple sugars. Disaccharides are double sugars, consisting of two monosaccharides joined by condensation. The carbohydrates that are macromolecules are polysaccharides, polymers of many sugars.





LIPIDS--DIVERSE HYDROPHOBIC MOLECULES

 

 Fats store large amounts of energy



 

 Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes



 

 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones



Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that does not include polymers. The compounds called lipids are grouped together because they share one important trait: They have little or no affinity for water. The hydrophobic behavior of lipids is based on their molecular structure. Although they may have some polar bonds associated with oxygen, lipids consist mostly of hydrocarbons. Smaller than true (polymeric) macromolecules, lipids are a highly varied group in both form and function. Lipids include waxes and certain pigments, but we will focus on the most important families of lipids: the fats, phospholipids, and steroids.





PROTEINS--MANY STRUCTURES, MANY FUNCTIONS

 

 A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids connected in a specific sequence



 

 A protein's function depends on its specific conformation



The importance of proteins is implied by their name, which comes from the Greek word proteios, meaning "first place." Proteins account for more than 50%  of the dry weight of most cells, and they are instrumental in almost everything organisms do (TABLE 5.1, p. 72). Proteins are used for structural support, storage, transport of other substances, signaling from one part of the organism to another, movement, and defense against foreign substances. In addition, as enzymes, proteins regulate metabolism by selectively accelerating chemical reactions in the cell. A human has tens of thousands of different proteins, each with a specific structure and function.

Consistent with their diverse functions, they vary extensively in structure, each type of protein having a unique three-dimensional shape, or conformation. Diverse though proteins may be, they are all polymers constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids. Polymers of amino acids are called polypeptides. A protein consists of one or more polypeptides folded and coiled into specific conformations.





NUCLEIC ACIDS--INFORMATIONAL POLYMERS

 

 Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information



 

 A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides



 

 Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix



 

 We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution



If the primary structure of polypeptides determines the conformation of a protein, what determines primary structure? The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a unit of inheritance known as a gene. Genes consist of DNA, which is a polymer belonging to the class of compounds known as nucleic acids.





 Most macromolecules are polymers

The large molecules in three of the four classes of life's organic compounds--carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids--are chainlike molecules called polymers (from the Greek polys, many, and meris, part). A polymer is a long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by covalent bonds, much as a train consists of a chain of cars. The repeating units that serve as the building blocks of a polymer are small molecules called monomers. Some of the molecules that serve as monomers also have other functions of their own.

The classes of polymeric macromolecules differ in the nature of their monomers, but the chemical mechanisms that cells use to make and break polymers are basically the same in all cases (FIGURE 5.2). Monomers are connected by a reaction in which two molecules are covalently bonded to each other through loss of a water molecule; this is called a condensation reaction, specifically a dehydration reaction, because the molecule lost is water (FIGURE 5.2a). When a bond forms between two monomers, each monomer contributes part of the water molecule that is lost: One molecule provides a hydroxyl group (--OH), while the other provides a hydrogen (--H). To make a polymer, this reaction is repeated as monomers are added to the chain one by one. The cell must expend energy to carry out these dehydration reactions, and the process occurs only with the help of enzymes, specialized proteins that speed up chemical reactions in cells.

Fig 5-2. The synthesis and breakdown of polymers.

Polymers are disassembled to monomers by hydrolysis, a process that is essentially the reverse of the dehydration reaction (FIGURE 5.2b). Hydrolysis means to break with water (from the Greek hydro, water, and lysis, break). Bonds between monomers are broken by the addition of water molecules, a hydrogen from the water attaching to one monomer and a hydroxyl attaching to the adjacent monomer. An example of hydrolysis working in our bodies is the process of digestion. The bulk of the organic material in our food is in the form of polymers that are much too large to enter our cells. Within the digestive tract, various enzymes attack the polymers, speeding up hydrolysis. The released monomers are then absorbed into the bloodstream for distribution to all body cells. Those cells can then use dehydration reactions to assemble the monomers into new polymers that differ from the ones that were digested.





 An immense variety of polymers can be built from a small set of monomers

Each cell has thousands of different kinds of macromolecules; the collection varies from one type of cell to another in the same organism. The inherent differences between human siblings reflect variations in polymers, particularly DNA and proteins. Molecular differences between unrelated individuals are more extensive--and between species greater still. The diversity of macromolecules in the living world is vast, and the potential variety is effectively limitless.

What is the basis for such diversity in life's polymers? These molecules are constructed from only 40 to 50 common monomers and some others that occur rarely. Building an enormous variety of polymers from such a limited list of monomers is analogous to constructing hundreds of thousands of words from only 26 letters of the alphabet. The key is arrangement--variation in the linear sequence the units follow. However, this analogy falls far short of describing the great diversity of macromolecules, because most biological polymers are much longer than the longest word. Proteins, for example, are built from 20 kinds of amino acids arranged in chains that are typically hundreds of amino acids long. The molecular logic of life is simple but elegant: Small molecules common to all organisms are ordered into unique macromolecules.

We are now ready to investigate the specific structures and functions of the four major classes of organic compounds found in cells. For each class, we will see that the large molecules have emergent properties not found in their individual building blocks.





 Sugars, the smallest carbohydrates, serve as fuel and carbon sources

Monosaccharides (from the Greek monos, single, and sacchar, sugar) generally have molecular formulas that are some multiple of CH2O (FIGURE 5.3). Glucose (C6H12O6), the most common monosaccharide, is of central importance in the chemistry of life. In the structure of glucose, we can see the trademarks of a sugar: The molecule has a carbonyl group () and multiple hydroxyl groups. Depending on the location of the carbonyl group, a sugar is either an aldose (aldehyde sugar) or a ketose (ketone sugar). Glucose, for example, is an aldose; fructose, a structural isomer of glucose, is a ketose. (Most names for sugars end in -ose.) Another criterion for classifying sugars is the size of the carbon skeleton, which ranges from three to seven carbons long. Glucose, fructose, and other sugars that have six carbons are called hexoses. Trioses (three-carbon sugars) and pentoses (five-carbon sugars) are also common.

Still another source of diversity for simple sugars is in the spatial arrangement of their parts around asymmetric carbons. (Recall from Chapter 4 that an asymmetric carbon is one attached to four different kinds of covalent partners.) Glucose and galactose, for example, differ only in the placement of parts around one asymmetric carbon (see the gray boxes in FIGURE 5.3). What may seem at first a small difference is significant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes and behaviors.

Although it is convenient to draw glucose with a linear carbon skeleton, this representation is not accurate. In aqueous solutions, glucose molecules, as well as most other sugars, form rings (FIGURE 5.4).

Fig 5-4. Linear and ring forms of glucose.

Monosaccharides, particularly glucose, are major nutrients for cells. In the process known as cellular respiration, cells extract the energy stored in glucose molecules. Not only are simple sugar molecules a major fuel for cellular work, but their carbon skeletons serve as raw material for the synthesis of other types of small organic molecules, such as amino acids and fatty acids. Sugar molecules that are not immediately used in these ways are generally incorporated as monomers into disaccharides or polysaccharides.

A disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage, a covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction. For example, maltose is a disaccharide formed by the linking of two molecules of glucose (FIGURE 5.5a). Also known as malt sugar, maltose is an ingredient for brewing beer. The most prevalent disaccharide is sucrose, which is table sugar. Its two monomers are glucose and fructose (FIGURE 5.5b). Plants generally transport carbohydrates from leaves to roots and other nonphotosynthetic organs in the form of sucrose. Lactose, the sugar present in milk, is another disaccharide, consisting of a glucose molecule joined to a galactose molecule.

Fig 5-5. Examples of disaccharide synthesis.





 Polysaccharides, the polymers of sugars, have storage and structural roles

Polysaccharides are macromolecules, polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages. Some polysaccharides serve as storage material, hydrolyzed as needed to provide sugar for cells. Other polysaccharides serve as building material for structures that protect the cell or the whole organism. The architecture and function of a polysaccharide are determined by its sugar monomers and by the positions of its glycosidic linkages.

Storage Polysaccharides

Starch, a storage polysaccharide of plants, is a polymer consisting entirely of glucose monomers (FIGURE 5.6a). Most of these monomers are joined by 1-4 linkages (number 1 carbon to number 4 carbon), like the glucose units in maltose (see FIGURE 5.5a). The angle of these bonds makes the polymer helical. The simplest form of starch, amylose, is unbranched. Amylopectin, a more complex form of starch, is a branched polymer with 1-6 linkages at the branch points.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 5-6. Storage polysaccharides. These examples, starch and glycogen, are composed entirely of glucose monomers, abbreviated here as hexagons. The polymer chains tend to spiral to form helices.

Plants store starch as granules within cellular structures called plastids, including chloroplasts (see FIGURE 5.6a). By synthesizing starch, the plant can stockpile surplus glucose. Because glucose is a major cellular fuel, starch represents stored energy. The sugar can later be withdrawn from this carbohydrate bank by hydrolysis, which breaks the bonds between the glucose monomers. Most animals, including humans, also have enzymes that can hydrolyze plant starch, making glucose available as a nutrient for cells. Potato tubers and grains--the fruits of wheat, corn, rice, and other grasses--are the major sources of starch in the human diet.

Animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen, a polymer of glucose that is like amylopectin but more extensively branched (see FIGURE 5.6b). Humans and other vertebrates store glycogen mainly in liver and muscle cells. Hydrolysis of glycogen in these cells releases glucose when the demand for sugar increases. This stored fuel cannot sustain an animal for long, however. In humans, for example, the glycogen bank is depleted in about a day unless it is replenished by consumption of food.

Structural Polysaccharides

Organisms build strong materials from structural polysaccharides. For example, the polysaccharide called cellulose is a major component of the tough walls that enclose plant cells. On a global scale, plants produce almost 1011 (100 billion) tons of cellulose per year; it is the most abundant organic compound on Earth. Like starch, cellulose is a polymer of glucose, but the glycosidic linkages in these two polymers differ. The difference is based on the fact that there are actually two slightly different ring structures for glucose (FIGURE 5.7a). When glucose forms a ring, the hydroxyl group attached to the number 1 carbon is locked into one of two alternative positions: either below or above the plane of the ring. These two ring forms for glucose are called alpha (a) and beta (b), respectively. In starch, all the glucose monomers are in the a configuration (FIGURE 5.7b), the arrangement we saw in FIGURES 5.4 and 5.5. In contrast, the glucose monomers of cellulose are all in the b configuration, making every other glucose monomer upside down with respect to the others (FIGURE 5.7c).

Fig 5-7. Starch and cellulose structures.

The differing glycosidic links in starch and cellulose give the two molecules distinct three-dimensional shapes. Whereas a starch molecule is mostly helical, a cellulose molecule is straight (and never branched), and its hydroxyl groups are free to hydrogen-bond with the hydroxyls of other cellulose molecules lying parallel to it. In plant cell walls, parallel cellulose molecules held together in this way are grouped into units called microfibrils (FIGURE 5.8, p. 68). These cables are a strong building material for plants--as well as for humans, who use wood, which is rich in cellulose, for lumber.

Fig 5-8. The arrangement of cellulose in plant cell walls.

Enzymes that digest starch by hydrolyzing its a linkages are unable to hydrolyze the b linkages of cellulose. In fact, few organisms possess enzymes that can digest cellulose. Humans do not; the cellulose fibrils in our food pass through the digestive tract and are eliminated with the feces. Along the way, the fibrils abrade the wall of the digestive tract and stimulate the lining to secrete mucus, which aids in the smooth passage of food through the tract. Thus, although cellulose is not a nutrient for humans, it is an important part of a healthful diet. Most fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains are rich in cellulose. On food packages, "insoluble fiber" refers mainly to cellulose.

Some microbes can digest cellulose, breaking it down to glucose monomers. A cow harbors cellulose-digesting bacteria in the rumen, the first compartment in its stomach. The bacteria hydrolyze the cellulose of hay and grass and convert the glucose to other nutrients that nourish the cow. Similarly, a termite, which is unable to digest cellulose for itself, has microbes living in its gut that can make a meal of wood. Some fungi can also digest cellulose, thereby helping recycle chemical elements within Earth's ecosystems.

Another important structural polysaccharide is chitin, the carbohydrate used by arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans, and related animals) to build their exoskeletons (FIGURE 5.9). An exoskeleton is a hard case that surrounds the soft parts of an animal. Pure chitin is leathery, but it becomes hardened when encrusted with calcium carbonate, a salt. Chitin is also found in many fungi, which use this polysaccharide rather than cellulose as the building material for their cell walls. Chitin is similar to cellulose, except that the glucose monomer of chitin has a nitrogen-containing appendage:

 Fats store large amounts of energy

Although fats are not polymers, they are large molecules, and they are assembled from smaller molecules by dehydration reactions. A fat is constructed from two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids (FIGURE 5.10). Glycerol is an alcohol with three carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl group. A fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. At one end of the fatty acid is a carboxyl group, the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acids. Attached to the carboxyl group is a long hydrocarbon chain. The nonpolar C--H bonds in the hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids are the reason fats are hydrophobic. Fats separate from water because the water molecules hydrogen-bond to one another and exclude the fats. A common example of this phenomenon is the separation of vegetable oil (a liquid fat) from the aqueous vinegar solution in a bottle of salad dressing.

Fig 5-10. The synthesis and structure of a fat, or triacylglycerol. The molecular building blocks of a fat are one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. (a) One water molecule is removed for each fatty acid joined to the glycerol. (b) The result is a fat. Although the fat shown here has three identical fatty acid units, other fats have two or even three different kinds of fatty acids. The carbons of the fatty acid chains are arranged zig-zag to suggest the actual orientations of the four single bonds extending from each carbon (see FIGURE 4.2).

In making a fat, three fatty acids each join to glycerol by an ester linkage, a bond between a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group. The resulting fat, also called a triacylglycerol, thus consists of three fatty acids ("tails") linked to one glycerol molecule (the "head"). (Still another name for a fat is triglyceride, a word often found in the list of ingredients on packaged foods.) The fatty acids in a fat can be the same, as in FIGURE 5.10b, or they can be of two or three different kinds.

Fatty acids vary in length and in the number and locations of double bonds. The terms saturated fats and unsaturated fats are commonly used in the context of nutrition (FIGURE 5.11). These terms refer to the structure of the hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acids. If there are no double bonds between the carbon atoms composing the chain, then as many hydrogen atoms as possible are bonded to the carbon skeleton. Such a structure is described as being saturated with hydrogen, so the resulting fatty acid is called a saturated fatty acid (see FIGURE 5.11a). An unsaturated fatty acid has one or more double bonds, formed by the removal of hydrogen atoms from the carbon skeleton. The fatty acid will have a kink in its tail wherever a double bond occurs (FIGURE 5.11b).

Fig 5-11. Examples of saturated and unsaturated fats and fatty acids.

A fat made from saturated fatty acids is called a saturated fat. Most animal fats are saturated: The "tails" of their fatty acids lack double bonds. Saturated animal fats--such as lard and butter--are solid at room temperature. In contrast, the fats of plants and fishes are generally unsaturated, meaning that they are built of one or more types of unsaturated fatty acids. Usually liquid at room temperature, plant and fish fats are referred to as oils--for instance, corn oil and cod liver oil. The kinks where the double bonds are located prevent the molecules from packing together closely enough to solidify at room temperature. The phrase "hydrogenated vegetable oils" on food labels means that unsaturated fats have been synthetically converted to saturated fats by adding hydrogen. Peanut butter, margarine, and many other products are hydrogenated to prevent lipids from separating out in liquid (oil) form.

A diet rich in saturated fats is one of several factors that may contribute to the cardiovascular disease known as atherosclerosis. In this condition, deposits called plaques develop on the internal lining of blood vessels, impeding blood flow and reducing the resilience of the vessels.

Fat has come to have such a negative connotation in our culture that you might wonder whether fats serve any useful purpose. The major function of fats is energy storage. The hydrocarbon chains of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and are just as rich in energy. A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide, such as starch. Because plants are relatively immobile, they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch. (Vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds, where more compact storage is an asset to the plant.) Animals, on the other hand, must carry their energy stores with them, so there is an advantage to having a more compact reservoir of fuel--fat. Humans and other mammals stock their long-term food reserves in adipose cells (see FIGURE 4.5), which swell and shrink as fat is deposited and withdrawn from storage. In addition to storing energy, adipose tissue also cushions such vital organs as the kidneys, and a layer of fat beneath the skin insulates the body. This subcutaneous layer is especially thick in whales, seals, and most other marine mammals.





 Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes

Phospholipids are similar to fats, but they have only two fatty acid tails rather than three. The third hydroxyl group of glycerol is joined to a phosphate group, which is negative in electrical charge. Additional small molecules, usually charged or polar, can be linked to the phosphate group to form a variety of phospholipids (FIGURE 5.12).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 5-12. The structure of a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a hydrophilic (polar) head and two hydrophobic tails. Phospholipid diversity is based on differences in the two fatty acid tails and in the groups attached to the phosphate group of the head. This particular phospholipid, called a phosphatidylcholine, has an attached choline group. The kink in one of its tails is due to a double bond. (a) The structural formula follows a common chemical convention of omitting the carbons and attached hydrogens of the hydrocarbon tails. (b) In the space-filling model, black = carbon, gray = hydrogen, red = oxygen, yellow = phosphorus, and blue = nitrogen. (c) This symbol for a phospholipid will appear throughout the book.

Phospholipids show ambivalent behavior toward water. Their tails, which consist of hydrocarbons, are hydrophobic and are excluded from water. However, the phosphate group and its attachments form a hydrophilic head that has an affinity for water.

When phospholipids are added to water, they self-assemble into aggregates that shield their hydrophobic portions from water. One kind of cluster is a micelle, a phospholipid droplet with the phosphate heads on the outside, in contact with water. The hydrocarbon tails are restricted to the water-free interior of the micelle (FIGURE 5.13a).

The hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids are in contact with water, whereas the hydrophobic tails are in contact with each other and remote from water. (a) A micelle, in cross section. (b) A cross section of a phospholipid bilayer between two aqueous compartments. Such bilayers are the main fabric of biological membranes.

At the surface of a cell, phospholipids are arranged in a bilayer, or double layer (FIGURE 5.13b). The hydrophilic heads of the molecules are on the outside of the bilayer, in contact with the aqueous solutions inside and outside the cell. The hydrophobic tails point toward the interior of the membrane, away from the water. The phospholipid bilayer forms a boundary between the cell and its external environment; in fact, phospholipids are major components of cell membranes. This behavior provides another example of how form fits function at the molecular level.





 Steroids include cholesterol and certain hormones

Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings (FIGURE 5.14). Different steroids vary in the functional groups attached to this ensemble of rings. One steroid, cholesterol, is a common component of animal cell membranes and is also the precursor from which other steroids are synthesized. Many hormones, including vertebrate sex hormones, are steroids produced from cholesterol (see FIGURE 4.8). Thus, cholesterol is a crucial molecule in animals, although a high level of it in the blood may contribute to atherosclerosis.

 A polypeptide is a polymer of amino acids connected in a specific sequence

As mentioned in Chapter 4, amino acids are organic molecules possessing both carboxyl and amino groups. The figure at the right shows the general formula for an amino acid. At the center of the amino acid is an asymmetric carbon atom called the alpha (a) carbon. Its four different partners are an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable group symbolized by R. The R group, also called the side chain, differs with the amino acid. FIGURE 5.15 shows the 20 amino acids that cells use to build their thousands of proteins. Here the amino and carboxyl groups are all depicted in ionized form, as they usually exist at the neutral pH inside a cell. The R group may be as simple as a hydrogen atom, as in the amino acid glycine (the one amino acid lacking an asymmetric carbon, since two of its a carbon's partners are hydrogen atoms), or it may be a carbon skeleton with various functional groups attached, as in glutamine. (Organisms have some other amino acids, not shown in FIGURE 5.15, but these are not incorporated into proteins.)

Fig 5-15. The 20 amino acids of proteins. The amino acids are grouped here according to the properties of their side chains (R groups), highlighted in white. (One group is shown above; the other groups are on page 73.) The amino acids are shown in their prevailing ionic forms at pH 7, the approximate pH within a cell. In parentheses are the three-letter abbreviations for the amino acids. All the amino acids used in proteins are the same enantiomer, called the L form (see FIGURE 4.6).

The physical and chemical properties of the side chain determine the unique characteristics of a particular amino acid. In FIGURE 5.15, the amino acids are grouped according to the properties of their side chains. One group consists of amino acids with nonpolar side chains, which are hydrophobic. Another group consists of amino acids with polar side chains, which are hydrophilic. Acidic amino acids are those with side chains that are generally negative in charge owing to the presence of a carboxyl group, which is usually dissociated (ionized) at cellular pH. Basic amino acids have amino groups in their side chains that are generally positive in charge. (Notice that all amino acids have carboxyl groups and amino groups; the terms acidic and basic in this context refer only to the side chains.) Because they are charged, acidic and basic side chains are also hydrophilic.

Now that we have examined amino acids, let's see how they are linked to form polymers (FIGURE 5.16). When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other, an enzyme can cause them to join by catalyzing a dehydration reaction. The resulting covalent bond is called a peptide bond. Repeated over and over, this process yields a polypeptide, a polymer of many amino acids linked by peptide bonds (FIGURE 5.16). At one end of the polypeptide chain is a free amino group, and at the opposite end is a free carboxyl group. Thus, the chain has an amino end (N-terminus) and a carboxyl end (C-terminus). The repeating sequence of atoms highlighted in purple in FIGURE 5.16b is called the polypeptide backbone. Attached to this backbone are different kinds of appendages, the side chains of the amino acids. Polypeptides range in length from a few monomers to a thousand or more. Each specific polypeptide has a unique linear sequence of amino acids. The immense variety of polypeptides in nature illustrates an important concept introduced earlier--that cells can make many different polymers by linking a limited set of monomers into diverse sequences.

(b) The peptide bonds are formed one at a time, starting with the amino acid at the amino end (N-terminus). The polypeptide has a repetitive backbone (purple) to which the amino acid side chains are attached.





 A protein's function depends on its specific conformation

The term polypeptide is not quite synonymous with protein. The relationship is somewhat analogous to that between a long strand of yarn and a sweater of particular size and shape that one can knit from the yarn. A functional protein is not just a polypeptide chain, but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape (FIGURE 5.17). It is the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide that determines what three-dimensional conformation the protein will take. Many proteins are globular (roughly spherical), while others are fibrous in shape. However, within these broad categories, countless variations are possible.

Fig 5-17. Conformation of a protein, the enzyme lysozyme. Present in our sweat, tears, and saliva, lysozyme is an enzyme that helps prevent infection by binding to and destroying specific molecules on the surface of many kinds of bacteria. The groove is the part of the protein that recognizes and binds to the target molecules on bacterial walls. (In the ribbon model, the yellow lines represent one type of chemical bond that stabilizes the protein's shape.)

A protein's specific conformation determines how it works. In almost every case, the function of a protein depends on its ability to recognize and bind to some other molecule. For instance, an antibody binds to a particular foreign substance that has invaded the body, and an enzyme recognizes and binds to its substrate, the substance the enzyme works on. In Chapter 2, you learned that one nerve cell in the brain signals another by dispatching specific molecules that have a unique shape. The receptor molecules on the surface of the receiving cell are proteins that fit the signal molecules something like a lock and key (see FIGURE 2.18).

Four Levels of Protein Structure

When a cell synthesizes a polypeptide, the chain generally folds spontaneously to assume the functional conformation for that protein. This folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of a variety of bonds between parts of the chain. Thus, the function of a protein--the ability of a receptor protein to identify and associate with a particular chemical messenger, for instance--is an emergent property resulting from exquisite molecular order. In the complex architecture of a protein, we can recognize three superimposed levels of structure, known as primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. A fourth level, quaternary structure, arises when a protein consists of two or more polypeptide chains.

Primary Structure. The primary structure of a protein is its unique sequence of amino acids. As an example, we will examine the primary structure of lysozyme, the antibacterial enzyme illustrated in its three-dimensional form in FIGURE 5.17. Lysozyme is a relatively small protein, its single polypeptide chain only 129 amino acids long. In FIGURE 5.18, the polypeptide chain is unraveled for a closer look at its primary structure. A specific one of the 20 amino acids occupies each of the 129 positions along the chain. The primary structure is like the order of letters in a very long word. If left to chance, there would be 20129 different ways of arranging amino acids into a polypeptide chain of this length. However, the precise primary structure of a protein is determined not by the random linking of amino acids, but by inherited genetic information.

Fig 5-18. The primary structure of a protein. This is the unique amino acid sequence, or primary structure, of the enzyme lysozyme. The names of the amino acids are given as their three-letter abbreviations. The chain was drawn in this serpentine fashion to make the entire sequence readily visible. The actual shape of lysozyme is shown in FIGURE 5.17.

Even a slight change in primary structure can affect a protein's conformation and ability to function. For instance, the substitution of one amino acid for another at a particular position in the primary structure of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells, causes sickle-cell disease, an inherited blood disorder. Normal red blood cells are disk-shaped, but in sickle-cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to crystallize, deforming some of the cells into a sickle shape (FIGURE 5.19). The life of someone with the disease is punctuated by "sickle-cell crises," which occur when the angular cells clog tiny blood vessels, impeding blood flow.

Fig 5-19. A single amino acid substitution in a protein causes sickle-cell disease.

The pioneer in determining the primary structure of proteins was Frederick Sanger, who, with his colleagues at Cambridge University in England, worked out the amino acid sequence of the hormone insulin in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His approach was to use protein-digesting enzymes and other catalysts that break polypeptides at specific places rather than completely hydrolyzing the chains. Treatment with one of these agents cleaves a polypeptide into fragments that can be separated by a technique called chromatography. Hydrolysis with another agent breaks the polypeptide at different sites, yielding a second group of fragments. Sanger used chemical methods to determine the sequence of amino acids in these small fragments. Then he searched for overlapping regions among the pieces obtained by hydrolyzing with the different agents. Consider, for instance, two fragments with the following sequences:
We can deduce from the overlapping regions that the intact polypeptide contains in its primary structure the following segment:

Just as we could reconstruct this sentence from a collection of fragments with overlapping sequences of letters, Sanger and his co-workers were able, after years of effort, to reconstruct the complete primary structure of insulin. Since then, most of the steps involved in sequencing a polypeptide have been automated. However, it was Sanger's analysis of insulin that first demonstrated what is now a fundamental axiom of molecular biology: A protein has a unique primary structure, a precise sequence of amino acids.

Secondary Structure. Most proteins have segments of their polypeptide chain repeatedly coiled or folded in patterns that contribute to the protein's overall conformation. These coils and folds, collectively referred to as secondary structure, are the result of hydrogen bonds at regular intervals along the polypeptide backbone (FIGURE 5.20). Only the atoms of the backbone are involved, not the amino acid side chains. Both the oxygen and the nitrogen atoms of the backbone are electronegative, with partial negative charges (see Chapter 2). The weakly positive hydrogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom has an affinity for the oxygen atom of a nearby peptide bond. Individually, these hydrogen bonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein. One such secondary structure is the a helix, a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid. The regions of a helix in the enzyme lysozyme are evident in FIGURE 5.20, where one a helix is enlarged to show the hydrogen bonds. Lysozyme is fairly typical of a globular protein in that it has a few stretches of a helix separated by nonhelical regions. In contrast, some fibrous proteins, such as a-keratin, the structural protein of hair, have the a-helix formation over most of their length.

Fig 5-20. The secondary structure of a protein. Two types of secondary structure, the a helix and the b pleated sheet, can both be found in the protein lysozyme. Both patterns depend on hydrogen bonding between * groups along the polypeptide backbone. The R groups of the amino acids are omitted in these diagrams, as are the hydrogen atoms not involved in hydrogen bonding.

The other main type of secondary structure is the b pleated sheet, in which two or more regions of the polypeptide chain lie parallel to each other. Hydrogen bonds between the parts of the backbone in the parallel regions hold the structure together. Pleated sheets make up the core of many globular proteins, and we can see one such region in lysozyme in FIGURE 5.20. Also, pleated sheets dominate some fibrous proteins, including the silk produced by many insects and spiders (FIGURE 5.21). The silk protein of a spider's web contains many regions of b pleated sheet. The teamwork of so many hydrogen bonds makes each silk fiber stronger than steel.

Fig 5-21. Spider silk: a structural protein. The silk protein owes its strength and resilience largely to its secondary structure: It contains many regions of b pleated sheets. When an insect is unfortunate enough to fly into the web, the silk fibers first uncoil and stretch, absorbing the shock, and then rewind, trapping the prey.

Tertiary Structure. Superimposed on the patterns of secondary structure is a protein's tertiary structure, consisting of irregular contortions from interactions between side chains (R groups) of the various amino acids (FIGURE 5.22). One of the types of interaction that contributes to tertiary structure is--somewhat misleadingly--called a hydrophobic interaction. As a polypeptide folds into its functional conformation, amino acids with hydrophobic (nonpolar) side chains usually end up in clusters at the core of the protein, out of contact with water. Thus, what we call a hydrophobic interaction is actually caused by the action of water molecules, which exclude nonpolar substances as they hydrogen-bond to one another and to hydrophilic parts of the protein. Once nonpolar amino acid side chains are close together, van der Waals interactions help hold them together. Meanwhile, hydrogen bonds between polar side chains and ionic bonds between positively and negatively charged side chains also help stabilize tertiary structure. These are all weak interactions, but their cumulative effect helps give the protein a specific shape.

Fig 5-22. Examples of interactions contributing to the tertiary structure of a protein. Hydrophobic side chains usually end up in the interior of a protein, away from water. Along with this clustering of hydrophobic groups, misleadingly called hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals interactions are all weak interactions (weak bonds) between side chains that collectively hold the protein in a specific conformation. Much stronger are the disulfide bridges, covalent bonds between the side chains of two cysteine amino acids. This diagram shows only one small part of a hypothetical protein.

The conformation of a protein may be reinforced further by strong, covalent bonds called disulfide bridges. Disulfide bridges form where two cysteine monomers, amino acids with sulfhydryl groups (--SH) on their side chains, are brought close together by the folding of the protein. The sulfur of one cysteine bonds to the sulfur of the second, and the disulfide bridge (--S--S--) rivets parts of the protein together. (The yellow lines in FIGURES 5.17 and 5.20 represent disulfide bridges.) All of these different kinds of bonds can occur in one protein, as shown diagramatically in FIGURE 5.22.

Quaternary Structure. As mentioned previously, some proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains aggregated into one functional macromolecule. Quaternary structure is the overall protein structure that results from the aggregation of these polypeptide subunits. For example, collagen is a fibrous protein that has helical subunits supercoiled into a larger triple helix (FIGURE 5.23a). This supercoiled organization of collagen, which is similar to the construction of a rope, gives the long fibers great strength. This suits collagen fibers to their function as the girders of connective tissue in skin, bone, tendons, ligaments, and other body parts. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of red blood cells, is an example of a globular protein with quaternary structure (FIGURE 5.23b). It consists of two kinds of polypeptide chains, with two of each kind per hemoglobin molecule.

Fig 5-23. The quaternary structure of proteins. At this level of structure, two or more polypeptide subunits associate to form a functional protein. (a) Collagen is a fibrous protein consisting of three helical polypeptides that are supercoiled to form a ropelike structure of great strength. Accounting for 40%  of the protein in the human body, collagen strengthens connective tissue throughout the body. (b) Hemoglobin is a globular protein with four polypeptide subunits, two of one kind (a chains) and two of another kind (b chains). Both a and b subunits consist primarily of a-helical secondary structure, represented by the thicker cylindrical sections of the polypeptides in this model. (Each subunit has a nonpolypeptide component, called heme, with an iron atom that binds oxygen.)

We have taken the reductionist approach in dissecting proteins to their four levels of structural organization. However, it is the overall product, a macromolecule with a unique shape, that works in a cell. The specific function of a protein is an emergent property that arises from the architecture of the molecule. FIGURE 5.24 reviews the levels of protein structure.

What Determines Protein Conformation?

You've learned that unique conformation endows each protein with a specific function, but what are the key factors determining conformation? You already know most of the answer: A polypeptide chain of a given amino acid sequence can spontaneously arrange itself into a three-dimensional shape determined and maintained by the interactions responsible for secondary and tertiary structure. This normally occurs as the protein is being synthesized within the cell. However, protein conformation also depends on the physical and chemical conditions of the protein's environment. If the pH, salt concentration, temperature, or other aspects of its environment are altered, the protein may unravel and lose its native conformation, a change called denaturation (FIGURE 5.25). Because it is misshapen, the denatured protein is biologically inactive. Most proteins become denatured if they are transferred from an aqueous environment to an organic solvent, such as ether or chloroform; the protein turns inside out, its hydrophobic regions changing places with its hydrophilic portions. Other denaturation agents include chemicals that disrupt the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and disulfide bridges that maintain a protein's shape. Denaturation can also result from excessive heat, which agitates the polypeptide chain enough to overpower the weak interactions that stabilize conformation. The white of an egg becomes opaque during cooking because the denatured proteins are insoluble and solidify.

Fig 5-25. Denaturation and renaturation of a protein. High temperatures or various chemical treatments will denature a protein, causing it to lose its conformation and hence its ability to function. If the denatured protein remains dissolved, it can often renature when the chemical and physical aspects of its environment are restored to normal.

When a protein in a test-tube solution has been denatured by heat or chemicals, it will often return to its functional shape when the denaturing agent is removed. We can conclude that the information for building specific shape is intrinsic in the protein's primary structure. The sequence of amino acids determines conformation--where an a helix can form, where b pleated sheets can occur, where disulfide bridges are located, where ionic bonds can form, and so on. However, in the crowded environment inside a cell, correct folding may be more of a problem than it is in a test tube.

The Protein-Folding Problem

Biochemists now know the amino acid sequences of more than 100,000 proteins and the three-dimensional shapes of about 10,000. One would think that by correlating the primary structures of many proteins with their conformations, it would be relatively easy to discover the rules of protein folding. Unfortunately, the protein-folding problem is not that simple. Most proteins probably go through several intermediate states on their way to a stable conformation, and looking at the "mature" conformation does not reveal the stages of folding that are required to achieve that form. However, biochemists have developed methods for tracking a protein through its intermediate stages of folding. Researchers have also discovered chaperonins (also called chaperone proteins), protein molecules that assist the proper folding of other proteins. Chaperonins do not actually specify the correct final structure of a polypeptide. Instead they work by keeping the new polypeptide segregated from "bad influences" in the cytoplasmic environment while it folds spontaneously. One well-studied chaperonin, from the bacterium E. coli, is a giant multiprotein complex shaped like a hollow cylinder. The cavity provides a shelter for folding polypeptides of various types (FIGURE 5.26).

Fig 5-26. A chaperonin in action. The computer graphic shows a large chaperonin protein "complex" with an interior space that provides a shelter for the proper folding of newly made polypeptides. The complex consists of two proteins, with a total of 21 polypeptide subunits and a mass of almost 900,000 daltons! One protein is a hollow cylinder; the other is a cap that can fit on either end.

Beyond the reach of today's computers, the simulation of protein folding is the goal of a five-year project at the IBM Corporation. Scientists at IBM aim to develop an extraordinarily powerful supercomputer, to be called Blue Gene, able to generate the three-dimensional structure of any protein starting from its amino acid sequence (or from the gene sequence that encodes the amino acid sequence). Among the practical benefits of this project may be the discovery of protein-folding principles that can be used to design custom proteins for medical and other uses.

Determining the Structure of a Protein

Even when scientists have an actual protein in hand, determining its exact three-dimensional structure is not simple, for a single protein molecule is built of thousands of atoms. FIGURE 5.27 describes X-ray crystallography, the main method used for the task. X-ray crystallography depends on the diffraction (deflection) of an X-ray beam by the individual atoms in a crystal of the protein. After the spatial coordinates of the atoms are determined in this way, a model of the protein is built. Linus Pauling and other pioneers of molecular biology built models from wood, wire, and plastic model sets. Computers have made it possible to build models much more quickly.

Fig 5-27. X-ray crystallography. This series of illustrations (from the Department of Biochemistry at the University of California, Riverside) shows how scientists determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein using X-ray crystallography. The protein here is an enzyme called ribonuclease, whose function involves binding to a nucleic acid molecule. Before X-ray crystallography can be carried out, the protein must be crystallized, in this case in combination with a short strand of nucleic acid. Computer analysis of the results of X-ray crystallography result in a map of all the atoms of the molecules in three-dimensional space. Finally, the scientists use other computer software to generate a three-dimensional model of the enzyme and nucleic acid.





 Nucleic acids store and transmit hereditary information

There are two types of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). These are the molecules that enable living organisms to reproduce their complex components from one generation to the next. Unique among molecules, DNA provides directions for its own replication. DNA also directs RNA synthesis and, through RNA, controls protein synthesis.

DNA is the genetic material that organisms inherit from their parents. A DNA molecule is very long and usually consists of hundreds or thousands of genes. When a cell reproduces itself by dividing, its DNA molecules (one per chromosome) are copied and passed along from one generation of cells to the next. Encoded in the structure of DNA is the information that programs all the cell's activities. The DNA, however, is not directly involved in running the operations of the cell, any more than computer software by itself can print a bank statement or read the bar code on a box of cereal. Just as a printer is needed to print out a statement and a scanner is needed to read a bar code, proteins are required to implement genetic programs. The molecular hardware of the cell--the tools for most biological functions--consists of proteins. For example, it is the protein hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood, not the DNA that specifies the structure of hemoglobin.

How does RNA, the other type of nucleic acid, fit into the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins? Each gene along the length of a DNA molecule directs the synthesis of a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA molecule then interacts with the cell's protein-synthesizing machinery to direct the production of a polypeptide. We can summarize the flow of genetic information as DN  RNA  protein (FIGURE 5.28, p. 82). The actual sites of protein synthesis are cellular structures called ribosomes. In a eukaryotic cell, ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm, but DNA resides in the nucleus. Messenger RNA conveys the genetic instructions for building proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells lack nuclei, but they still use RNA to send a message from the DNA to the ribosomes and other equipment of the cell that translate the coded information into amino acid sequences.

Fig 5-28. DN  RNA  protein: a diagrammatic overview of information flow in a cell. In a eukaryotic cell, DNA in the nucleus programs protein production in the cytoplasm by dictating the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), which travels to the cytoplasm and binds to ribosomes. As a ribosome (greatly enlarged in this drawing) moves along the mRNA, the genetic message is translated into a polypeptide of specific amino acid sequence.





 A nucleic acid strand is a polymer of nucleotides

Nucleic acids are polymers of monomers called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is itself composed of three parts: an organic molecule called a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group (FIGURE 5.29a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 5-29. The components of nucleic acids. (a) Nucleotides, the monomers of nucleic acids, are themselves composed of three smaller molecular building blocks: a nitrogenous base (either a purine or a pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, (either deoxyribose or ribose), and a phosphate group. RNA has ribose as its sugar, and DNA has deoxyribose. Also, RNA has uracil, and DNA has thymine. (b) The three components of a nucleotide are linked together as shown here. (c) In polynucleotides, each nucleotide monomer has its phosphate group bonded to the sugar of the next nucleotide. The polymer has a regular sugar-phosphate backbone with variable appendages, the four kinds of nitrogenous bases. RNA usually exists in the form of a single polynucleotide, like the one shown here.

There are two families of nitrogenous bases: pyrimidines and purines. A pyrimidine has a six-membered ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms. (The nitrogen atoms tend to take up H+ from solution, which explains the term nitrogenous base.) The members of the pyrimidine family are cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). Purines are larger, with the six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The purines are adenine (A) and guanine (G). The specific pyrimidines and purines differ in the functional groups attached to the rings. Adenine, guanine, and cytosine are found in both types of nucleic acid. Thymine is found only in DNA and uracil only in RNA.

The pentose connected to the nitrogenous base is ribose in the nucleotides of RNA and deoxyribose in DNA. The only difference between these two sugars is that deoxyribose lacks an oxygen atom on its number 2 carbon--hence its name.

So far, we have built a nucleoside, which is a nitrogenous base joined to a sugar. To complete the construction of a nucleotide, we attach a phosphate group to the number 5 carbon of the sugar (FIGURE 5.29b). The molecule is now a nucleoside monophosphate, better known as a nucleotide.

In a nucleic acid polymer, or polynucleotide, nucleotides are joined by covalent bonds called phosphodiester linkages between the phosphate of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next. This bonding results in a backbone with a repeating pattern of sugar-phosphate units (FIGURE 5.29c). All along this sugar-phosphate backbone are appendages consisting of the nitrogenous bases.

The sequence of bases along a DNA (or mRNA) polymer is unique for each gene. Because genes are hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long, the number of possible base sequences is effectively limitless. A gene's meaning to the cell is encoded in its specific sequence of the four DNA bases. For example, the sequence AGGTAACTT means one thing, whereas the sequence CGCTTTAAC has a different translation. (Real genes, of course, are much longer.) The linear order of bases in a gene specifies the amino acid sequence--the primary structure--of a protein, which in turn specifies that protein's three-dimensional conformation and function in the cell.





 Inheritance is based on replication of the DNA double helix

The RNA molecules of cells consist of a single polynucleotide chain like the one shown in FIGURE 5.29. In contrast, cellular DNA molecules have two polynucleotides that spiral around an imaginary axis to form a double helix (FIGURE 5.30, p. 84). James Watson and Francis Crick, working at Cambridge University, first proposed the double helix as the three-dimensional structure of DNA in 1953. The two sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix, and the nitrogenous bases are paired in the interior of the helix. The two polynucleotides, or strands, as they are called, are held together by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases and by van der Waals interactions between the stacked bases. Most DNA molecules are very long, with thousands or even millions of base pairs connecting the two chains. One long DNA double helix includes many genes, each one a particular segment of the molecule.

Fig 5-30. The DNA double helix and its replication. The DNA molecule is usually double-stranded, with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the polynucleotides (symbolized here by blue ribbons) on the outside of the helix. In the interior are pairs of nitrogenous bases, holding the two strands together by hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding between the bases is specific. As illustrated here with symbolic shapes for the bases, adenine (A) can pair only with thymine (T), and guanine (G) can pair only with cytosine (C). As a cell prepares to divide, the two strands of the double helix separate, and each serves as a template for the precise ordering of nucleotides into new complementary strands (orange). Each DNA strand in this figure is the structural equivalent of the polynucleotide diagrammed in FIGURE 5.29c.

Only certain bases in the double helix are compatible with each other. Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C). If we were to read the sequence of bases along one strand as we traveled the length of the double helix, we would know the sequence of bases along the other strand. If a stretch of one strand has the base sequence AGGTCCG, then the base-pairing rules tell us that the same stretch of the other strand must have the sequence TCCAGGC. The two strands of the double helix are complementary, each the predictable counterpart of the other. It is this feature of DNA that makes possible the precise copying of genes that is responsible for inheritance (FIGURE 5.30, p. 84). In preparation for cell division, each of the two strands of a DNA molecule serves as a template to order nucleotides into a new complementary strand. The result is two identical copies of the original double-stranded DNA molecule, which are then distributed to the two daughter cells. Thus, the structure of DNA accounts for its function in transmitting genetic information whenever a cell reproduces.





 We can use DNA and proteins as tape measures of evolution

Genes (DNA) and their products (proteins) document the hereditary background of an organism. The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA molecules are passed from parents to offspring, and these DNA sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins. Siblings have greater similarity in their DNA and proteins than do unrelated individuals of the same species. If the evolutionary view of life is valid, we should be able to extend this concept of "molecular genealogy" to relationships between species: We should expect two species that appear to be closely related based on fossil and anatomical evidence to also share a greater proportion of their DNA and protein sequences than do more distantly related species. That is the case. For example, TABLE 5.2 compares a polypeptide chain of human hemoglobin with the corresponding hemoglobin polypeptide in five other vertebrates. In this chain of 146 amino acids, humans and gorillas differ in just one amino acid. More distantly related species have chains that are less similar. Molecular biology has added a new tape measure to the toolkit biologists use to assess evolutionary kinship.

Chapter 6, the final chapter of this unit, will take us another step up the hierarchy of biological order by introducing the fundamental principles of metabolism.

   The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review

The living cell is a chemical industry in miniature, where thousands of reactions occur within a microscopic space. Sugars are converted to amino acids, and vice versa. Small molecules are assembled into polymers, which may be hydrolyzed later as the needs of the cell change. In plants and animals, many cells export chemical products that are used in other parts of the organism. The process known as cellular respiration drives the cellular economy by extracting the energy stored in sugars and other fuels. Cells apply this energy to perform various types of work, such as the synthesis of the macromolecules featured in Chapter 5. In a more exotic example, cells of the fungus in the photo above convert the energy stored in certain organic molecules to light, a process called bioluminescence. (The glow may attract insects that benefit the fungus by dispersing its spores.) Bioluminescence and all other metabolic activities carried out by a cell are precisely coordinated and controlled. In its complexity, its efficiency, its integration, and its responsiveness to subtle changes, the cell is peerless as a chemical institution. The concepts of metabolism you learn in this chapter will help you further understand the connections between chemistry and life.

 A cell's physical and chemical environment affects enzyme activity



The laws of thermodynamics tell us what can and cannot happen under given conditions but say nothing about the speed of these processes. A spontaneous chemical reaction may occur so slowly that it is imperceptible. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose (table sugar) to glucose and fructose (FIGURE 6.11) is exergonic, occurring spontaneously with a release of free energy (DG = - 7 kcal/mol). Yet a solution of sucrose dissolved in sterile water will sit for years at room temperature with no appreciable hydrolysis. But if we add a small amount of the enzyme sucrase to the solution, then all the sucrose may be hydrolyzed within seconds. How does an enzyme do this?

 The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review



Chemical chaos would result if all of a cell's metabolic pathways were open simultaneously. Imagine, for example, a substance synthesized by one pathway and immediately broken down by another. The cell would be spinning its metabolic wheels. Actually, a cell tightly regulates its metabolic pathways by controlling when and where its various enzymes are active. It does this either by switching on and off the genes that encode specific enzymes (as we will discuss in Unit Three) or, as we discuss here, by regulating the activity of enzymes once they are made.





 The chemistry of life is organized into metabolic pathways

We can think of a cell's metabolism as an elaborate road map of the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in that cell (FIGURE 6.1, p. 88). These reactions are arranged in intricately branched metabolic pathways that alter molecules by a series of steps. Enzymes route matter through the metabolic pathways by selectively accelerating each step. Analogous to the red, yellow, and green lights that control the flow of traffic and prevent snarls, mechanisms that regulate enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand, averting deficits and surpluses of chemicals.

Fig 6-1. The complexity of metabolism. This diagram traces only a few hundred of the thousands of metabolic reactions that occur in a cell. The dots represent molecules, and the lines represent the chemical reactions that transform them. The reactions proceed in stepwise sequences called metabolic pathways, in which each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. The inset shows the first two steps in the catabolic pathway that breaks down glucose. (You'll learn more about this pathway in Chapter 9.)

As a whole, metabolism is concerned with managing the material and energy resources of the cell. Some metabolic pathways release energy by breaking down complex molecules to simpler compounds. These degradative processes are called catabolic pathways. A major thoroughfare of catabolism is cellular respiration, in which the sugar glucose and other organic fuels are broken down to carbon dioxide and water. Energy that was stored in the organic molecules becomes available to do the work of the cell. Anabolic pathways, in contrast, consume energy to build complicated molecules from simpler ones. An example of anabolism is the synthesis of a protein from amino acids. Catabolic and anabolic pathways are the downhill and uphill avenues of the metabolic map. The metabolic pathways intersect in such a way that energy released from the "downhill" reactions of catabolism can be used to drive the "uphill" reactions of the anabolic pathways. This transfer of energy from catabolism to anabolism is called energy coupling.

In this chapter, we will focus on the mechanisms common to metabolic pathways. Because energy is fundamental to all metabolic processes, a basic knowledge of energy is necessary to understand how the living cell works. Although we will use some nonliving examples to study energy, keep in mind that the concepts demonstrated by these examples also apply to bioenergetics, the study of how organisms manage their energy resources. An understanding of energy is as important for students of biology as it is for students of physics, chemistry, and engineering.





 Organisms transform energy

Energy is the capacity to do work--that is, to move matter against opposing forces, such as gravity and friction. Put another way, energy is the ability to rearrange a collection of matter. For example, you expend energy to turn the pages of this book. Energy exists in various forms, and the work of life depends on the ability of cells to transform energy from one type into another.

Anything that moves possesses a form of energy called kinetic energy, the energy of motion. Moving objects perform work by imparting motion to other matter: A pool player uses the motion of the cue stick to push the cue ball, which in turn moves the other balls; water gushing through a dam turns turbines; electrons flowing along a wire run household appliances; the contraction of leg muscles pushes bicycle pedals. Light is also a type of kinetic energy that can be harnessed to perform work, such as powering photosynthesis in green plants. Heat, or thermal energy, is kinetic energy that results from the random movement of molecules.

A resting object not presently at work may still possess energy, which, remember, is the capacity to do work. Stored energy, or potential energy, is energy that matter possesses because of its location or structure. Water behind a dam, for instance, stores energy because of its altitude. Chemical energy, a form of potential energy especially important to biologists, is stored in molecules as a result of the arrangement of the atoms in those molecules.

How is energy converted from one form to another? Consider, for example, the playground scene in FIGURE 6.2. The girl at the bottom of the slide transformed kinetic energy to potential energy when she climbed the ladder up to the slide. This stored energy was converted back to kinetic energy as she slid down. It was another source of potential energy--the chemical energy in the food she ate for breakfast--that enabled the girl to climb the ladder in the first place.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 6-2. Transformations between kinetic and potential energy. The children have more potential energy at the top of the slide (because of the effect of gravity) than they do at the bottom.

Chemical energy can be tapped when chemical reactions rearrange the atoms of molecules in such a way that potential energy stored in the molecules is converted to kinetic energy. This transformation occurs, for example, in the engine of an automobile when the hydrocarbons of gasoline react explosively with oxygen, releasing the energy that pushes the pistons. Similarly, chemical energy fuels organisms. Cellular respiration and other catabolic pathways unleash energy stored in sugar and other complex molecules and make that energy available for cellular work. Each child who climbed the ladder in FIGURE 6.2 transformed some of the chemical energy that was stored in the organic molecules of food to the kinetic energy of his or her movements. The chemical energy stored in these fuel molecules had itself been derived from light energy by plants during photosynthesis. Organisms are energy transformers.





 The energy transformations of life are subject t+o two laws of thermodynamics

The study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called thermodynamics. Scientists use the word system to denote the matter under study and refer to the rest of the universe--everything outside the system--as the surroundings. A closed system, such as that approximated by liquid in a thermos bottle, is isolated from its surroundings. In an open system, energy (and often matter) can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. Organisms are open systems. They absorb energy--for instance, light energy or chemical energy in the form of organic molecules--and release heat and metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide, to the surroundings. Two laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations in organisms and all other collections of matter (FIGURE 6.3).

Fig 6-3. Two laws of thermodynamics. (a) The chemical (potential) energy in the gasoline will be converted to kinetic energy of the car's movement. (b) Disorder is added to the car's surrounding in the form of heat and the small molecules that are breakdown products of gasoline.

The First Law of Thermodynamics

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the universe is constant. Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The first law is also known as the principle of conservation of energy. The electric company does not manufacture energy, but merely converts it to a form that is convenient to use. By converting light to chemical energy, a green plant acts as an energy transformer, not an energy producer.

The car in FIGURE 6.3a will convert the chemical energy of gasoline fuels to kinetic and other forms of energy as it is driven away from the gas station. What happens to this energy after it has performed work in a machine or an organism? If energy cannot be destroyed, what prevents organisms from behaving like closed systems and recycling their energy? The second law answers these questions.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics can be stated many ways. Let's begin with the following statement of the second law: Every energy transfer or transformation makes the universe more disordered. Scientists use a quantity called entropy as a measure of disorder, or randomness. The more random a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy. We can therefore restate the second law as follows: Every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. Although order can increase locally, there is an unstoppable trend toward randomization of the universe as a whole.

In many cases, increased entropy is evident in the physical disintegration of a system's organized structure. For example, you can observe increasing entropy in the gradual decay of an unmaintained building. Much of the increasing entropy of the universe is less apparent, however, because it takes the form of an increasing amount of heat, which is the energy of random molecular motion. As the car in FIGURE 6.3b converts chemical energy to kinetic energy, it is also increasing the disorder of its surroundings in the form of heat and the small molecules that are the breakdown products of gasoline.

In most energy transformations, ordered forms of energy are at least partly converted to heat. Only about 25%  of the chemical energy stored in the fuel tank of an automobile is transformed into the motion of the car; the remaining 75%  is lost from the engine as heat, which dissipates rapidly through the surroundings. Similarly, the children in FIGURE 6.2 convert only a fraction of the energy stored in their food to the kinetic energy of ladder climbing and other play. In performing various kinds of work, living cells unavoidably convert organized forms of energy to heat. (This can make a room crowded with people uncomfortably warm.)

In machines and organisms, even energy that performs useful work is eventually converted to heat. The organized energy of an automobile's forward movement becomes heat when the friction of the brakes and tires stops the car. Conversion to heat is the fate of all the chemical energy a child uses to climb a slide: Metabolic breakdown of food generates heat during the climb, and the fraction of energy temporarily stored as gravitational potential energy is converted to heat on the way down, as friction warms the surrounding air.

Conversion of other forms of energy to heat does not violate the first law of thermodynamics. Energy has been conserved, because heat is a form of energy, though energy in its most random state. By combining the first and second laws of thermodynamics, we can conclude that the quantity of energy in the universe is constant, but its quality is not. In a sense, heat is the lowest grade of energy, as uncoordinated movement of molecules. A system can put heat to work only when there is a temperature difference that results in the heat flowing from a warmer location to a cooler one. If temperature is uniform, as it is in a living cell, then the only use for heat energy is to warm a body of matter, such as an organism.

How can we reconcile the second law of thermodynamics--the unstoppable increase in the entropy of the universe--with the orderliness of life (FIGURE 6.4), which is one of this book's themes? The key is to remember another theme: Organisms are open systems that exchange energy and materials with their surroundings. It is true that cells create ordered structures from less organized starting materials. For example, amino acids are ordered into the specific sequences of polypeptide chains. But an organism also takes in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replaces them with less ordered forms. For example, an animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases carbon dioxide and water--small, simple molecules that store less chemical energy than the food did. The depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism. On a larger scale, energy flows into an ecosystem in the form of light and leaves in the form of heat. Living systems increase the entropy of their surroundings, as predicted by thermodynamic law.

Fig 6-4. Order as a characteristic of life. Order is evident in the detailed anatomy of this root tissue from a buttercup plant (the micrograph shows a cross section). As open systems, organisms can increase their order at the expense of the order of their surroundings.

During the early history of life, complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors. For example, we can trace the ancestry of the plant kingdom to much simpler organisms called green algae. However, this increase in organization over time in no way violates the second law. The entropy of a particular system, such as an organism, may actually decrease, so long as the total entropy of the universe--the system plus its surroundings--increases. Thus, organisms are islands of low entropy in an increasingly random universe. The evolution of biological order is perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.





 Organisms live at the expense of free energy

How can we predict what can and cannot occur in nature? How can we distinguish the possible from the impossible? We know from experience that certain events occur spontaneously and others do not. For instance, we know that water flows downhill, that objects of opposite charge move toward each other, that an ice cube melts at room temperature, and that a sugar cube dissolves in water. Explaining why these processes occur spontaneously is tricky.

Let's begin by defining a spontaneous process as a change that can occur without outside help. A spontaneous change can be harnessed to perform work. The downhill flow of water can be used to turn a turbine in a power plant, for example. A process that cannot occur on its own is said to be nonspontaneous; it will happen only if energy is added to the system. Water moves uphill only when a windmill or some other machine pumps the water against gravity, and a cell must expend energy to synthesize a protein from amino acids.

When a spontaneous process occurs in a system, the stability of that system increases. Unstable systems tend to change in such a way that they become more stable. A body of elevated water, such as a reservoir, is less stable than the same water at sea level. A system of charged particles is less stable when opposite charges are apart than when they are together. A compressed spring is less stable than a relaxed one. In all of these examples, the system moves toward greater stability when nothing prevents such a change: The water falls, the opposite charges come together, the spring relaxes. In situations less familiar to us, how can we predict which changes lead to greater stability in a system--that is, which changes are spontaneous? You have already learned that a process can occur spontaneously only if it increases the disorder (entropy) of the universe. This principle is helpful in theory, but it does not give us a practical criterion to apply to biological systems because it requires that we measure changes in both the system and the surroundings. We need some standard for spontaneity that is based on the system alone. That criterion is called free energy.

Free Energy: A Criterion for Spontaneous Change

The concept of free energy is not easy to grasp, but the effort is worthwhile because we can apply the idea to many biological problems. Free energy is the portion of a system's energy that can perform work when temperature is uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell. It is called free energy because it is available for work, not because it can be spent without cost to the universe. In fact, you will soon understand that organisms can live only at the expense of free energy acquired from the surroundings. FIGURE 6.5 illustrates the relationship of free energy to spontaneity, stability, and work.

Fig 6-5. The relationship of free energy to stability, work capacity, and spontaneous change. Unstable systems (top diagrams) are rich in free energy. They have a tendency to change spontaneously to a more stable state (bottom), and it is possible to harness this "downhill" change to perform work. (a) In this case, free energy is proportional to the girl's altitude. (b) The free-energy concept also applies on the molecular scale, in this case to the movement of molecules known as diffusion. Here, molecules of a solute are distributed unequally across a membrane separating two aqueous compartments. This ordered state is unstable; it is rich in free energy. If the solute molecules can cross the membrane, there will be a net movement (diffusion) of the molecules until they are equally concentrated in the two compartments. (c) Chemical reactions also involve free energy. The sugar molecule on top is less stable than the simpler molecules below. When catabolic pathways break down complex organic molecules, a cell can perform work using the free energy that was stored in the more complex molecules.

A system's quantity of free energy is symbolized by the letter G. There are two components to G: the system's total energy (symbolized by H) and its entropy (symbolized by S). Free energy is related to these factors in the following way: 

where T stands for absolute temperature in Kelvin (K) units (K = &#176;C +273; see Appendix 2). Notice that temperature amplifies the entropy term of the equation. This makes sense if you remember that temperature measures the intensity of random molecular motion (heat), which tends to disrupt order. What does this equation tell us about free energy? Not all the energy stored in a system (H) is available for work. The system's disorder, the entropy factor, is subtracted from total energy in computing the maximum capacity of the system to perform useful work. We are then left with free energy, which is somewhat less than the system's total energy.

How does the concept of free energy help us determine whether a particular process can occur spontaneously? Think of free energy G as a measure of a system's instability--its tendency to change to a more stable state. Systems that are rich in energy, such as compressed springs or separated charges, are unstable; so are highly ordered systems, such as complex molecules. In other words, systems that tend to change spontaneously to a more stable state have high energy, low entropy, or both. The free-energy equation weighs these two factors, which are consolidated in the system's G content. Now we can state a versatile criterion for spontaneous change: In any spontaneous process, the free energy of a system decreases.

The change in free energy as a system goes from a starting state to a different state is represented by DG: 

Or, put another way:  For a process to occur spontaneously, the system must either give up energy (a decrease in H), give up order (an increase in S), or both. When these changes in H and S are tallied, DG must have a negative value (DG &lt; 0). The greater this decrease in free energy, the greater the maximum amount of work the spontaneous process can perform. This is a formal, mathematical way of stating the obvious: Nature runs "downhill" in the sense of a loss in useful energy, the capacity to perform work.

Free Energy and Equilibrium

Another term for a state of maximum stability is equilibrium, which you learned about in Chapter 2 in connection with chemical reactions. There is an important relationship between free energy and equilibrium, including chemical equilibrium. Recall that most chemical reactions are reversible and proceed until the forward and backward reactions occur at the same rate. The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further change in the concentration of products or reactants. As a reaction proceeds toward equilibrium, the free energy of the mixture of reactants and products decreases. Free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium. For a reaction at equilibrium, DG = 0, because there is no net change in the system. We can think of equilibrium as an energy valley. A chemical reaction or physical process at equilibrium performs no work. A process is spontaneous and can perform work when sliding toward equilibrium. Movement away from equilibrium is nonspontaneous; it can occur only with the help of an outside energy source. We can now apply the free-energy concept more specifically to the chemistry of life.

Free Energy and Metabolism

Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions in Metabolism. Based on their free-energy changes, chemical reactions can be classified as either exergonic ("energy outward") or endergonic ("energy inward"). An exergonic reaction proceeds with a net release of free energy (FIGURE 6.6a). Because the chemical mixture loses free energy, DG is negative for an exergonic reaction. In other words, exergonic reactions are those that occur spontaneously. The magnitude of DG for an exergonic reaction is the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform. We can use the overall reaction for cellular respiration as an example:

Fig 6-6. Energy changes in exergonic and endergonic reactions.

For each mole (180 g) of glucose broken down by respiration, 686 kcal (or 2,870 kJ) of energy are made available for work (under what scientists call standard conditions). Because energy must be conserved, the chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy than the reactants. The products are, in a sense, the spent exhaust of a process that tapped most of the free energy stored in the sugar molecules.

An endergonic reaction is one that absorbs free energy from its surroundings (FIGURE 6.6b). Because this kind of reaction stores free energy in molecules, DG is positive. Such reactions are nonspontaneous, and the magnitude of DG is the quantity of energy required to drive the reaction. If a chemical process is exergonic (downhill) in one direction, then the reverse process must be endergonic (uphill). A reversible process cannot be downhill in both directions. If DG = - 686 kcal/mol for respiration, then for photosynthesis to produce sugar from carbon dioxide and water, DG = +686 kcal/mol. Sugar production in the leaf cells of a plant is steeply endergonic, an uphill process powered by the absorption of light energy.

Metabolic Disequilibrium. Reactions in a closed system eventually reach equilibrium and can do no work, as illustrated by the closed hydroelectric system in FIGURE 6.7a. The chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, and they, too, would reach equilibrium if they occurred in the isolation of a test tube. Because systems at equilibrium have a DG of zero and can do no work, a cell that has reached metabolic equilibrium is dead! In fact, metabolic disequilibrium is one of the defining features of life.

Fig 6-7. Disequilibrium and work in closed and open systems.

A cell can maintain disequilibrium because it is an open system. The constant flow of materials in and out of the cell keeps the metabolic pathways from ever reaching equilibrium, and the cell continues to do work throughout its life. This principle is illustrated by the open (and more realistic) hydroelectric system in FIGURE 6.7b. However, unlike this simple single-step system, a catabolic pathway in a cell releases free energy in a series of reactions. An example is cellular respiration, illustrated by analogy in FIGURE 6.7c. Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly "pulled" in one direction--that is, they are kept out of equilibrium. The key to sustaining this disequilibrium is that the product of one reaction does not accumulate, but instead becomes a reactant in the next step. The overall sequence of reactions is kept going by the huge free-energy difference between glucose at the "uphill" end of the pathway and carbon dioxide and water at the "downhill" end. As long as the cell has a steady supply of glucose or other fuels and is able to expel waste products to the surroundings, its metabolic pathways never reach equilibrium and continue to do the work of life.

We see once again how important it is to think of organisms as open systems. Sunlight provides a daily source of free energy for an ecosystem's plants and other photosynthetic organisms. Animals and other nonphotosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem depend on free-energy transfusions in the form of the organic products of photosynthesis.

Now that we have applied the free-energy concept to metabolism, we are ready to see how a cell actually performs the work of life. A key feature of bioenergetics is energy coupling, the use of an exergonic process to drive an endergonic one. A molecule called ATP is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells.





 ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions

A cell does three main kinds of work:

Mechanical work, such as the beating of cilia, the contraction of muscle cells, and the movement of chromosomes during cellular reproduction

Transport work, the pumping of substances across membranes against the direction of spontaneous movement

Chemical work, the pushing of endergonic reactions that would not occur spontaneously, such as the synthesis of polymers from monomers

In most cases, the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work is ATP.

The Structure and Hydrolysis of ATP

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is closely related to one type of nucleotide found in nucleic acids. ATP has the nitrogenous base adenine bonded to ribose, as in an adenine nucleotide of RNA. In RNA, however, only one phosphate group is attached to the ribose (see FIGURE 5.29b), whereas adenosine triphosphate has a chain of three phosphate groups attached to the ribose (FIGURE 6.8a).

Fig 6-8. The structure and hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP yields inorganic phosphate and ADP. In the cell, most hydroxyl groups of phosphates are ionized (--O-).

The bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP's tail can be broken by hydrolysis. When the terminal phosphate bond is broken, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (abbreviated 



 throughout this book) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP (FIGURE 6.8b). The reaction is exergonic and under laboratory conditions releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed: 

This is the free-energy change measured under what are called standard conditions. However, the chemical and physical conditions in the cell do not conform to standard conditions. When the reaction occurs in the cellular environment rather than in a test tube, the actual DG is about - 13 kcal/mol, 78%  greater than the energy released by ATP hydrolysis under standard conditions.

Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as high-energy phosphate bonds, but the term is misleading. The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as "high-energy" may imply. In fact, compared to most bonds in organic molecules, these bonds are relatively weak, and it is because they are somewhat unstable that their hydrolysis yields energy. The products of hydrolysis (ADP and 



) are more stable than ATP. When a system changes in the direction of greater stability--when a compressed spring relaxes, for instance--the change is exergonic. Thus, the release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a more stable condition, not from the phosphate bonds themselves.

Why are the phosphate bonds so fragile? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in FIGURE 6.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged. These like charges are crowded together, and their repulsion contributes to the instability of this region of the ATP molecule. The triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a loaded spring.

How ATP Performs Work

When ATP is hydrolyzed in a test tube, the release of free energy merely heats the surrounding water. In the cell, that would be an inefficient and dangerous use of a valuable energy resource. With the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis directly to endergonic processes by transferring a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule. The recipient of the phosphate group is then said to be phosphorylated. The key to the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions is the formation of this phosphorylated intermediate, which is more reactive (less stable) than the original molecule. FIGURE 6.9 shows a cellular process that exemplifies this mechanism: the synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid (another amino acid) and ammonia.

Fig 6-9. Energy coupling by phosphate transfer. In this example, ATP hydrolysis drives the conversion of the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) to another amino acid, glutamine (Glu--NH2).

Nearly all cellular work depends on ATP's energizing of other molecules by transferring phosphate groups. For instance, when ATP powers the movement of muscles, it transfers phosphate groups to contractile proteins.

The Regeneration of ATP

An organism at work uses ATP continuously, but ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP (FIGURE 6.10). The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle, and it couples the cell's energy-yielding processes to the energy-producing ones. The ATP cycle moves at an astonishing pace. For example, a working muscle cell recycles its entire pool of ATP about once each minute. That turnover represents 10 million molecules of ATP consumed and regenerated per second per cell. If ATP could not be regenerated by the phosphorylation of ADP, humans would consume nearly their body weight in ATP each day.

Fig 6-10. The ATP cycle. Energy released by breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell is used to phosphorylate ADP, regenerating ATP. Energy stored in ATP drives most cellular work. Thus, ATP couples the cell's energy-yielding processes to the energy-consuming ones.

Because a reversible process cannot go downhill both ways, the regeneration of ATP from ADP is necessarily endergonic:  Catabolic (exergonic) pathways, especially cellular respiration, provide the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP. Plants also use light energy to produce ATP.

Thus, the ATP cycle is a turnstile through which energy passes during its transfer from catabolic to anabolic pathways. In fact, the energy temporarily stored in ATP drives most cellular work.





 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers

A catalyst is a chemical agent that changes the rate of a reaction without being consumed by the reaction; an enzyme is a catalytic protein. (Another class of biological catalysts, ribozymes, made of RNA, is discussed in Chapters 17 and 26.) In the absence of enzymes, chemical traffic through the pathways of metabolism would become hopelessly congested. In the next two sections, we will see what impedes a spontaneous reaction and how an enzyme changes the situation.

The Activation Energy Barrier

Every chemical reaction between molecules involves both bond breaking and bond forming. For example, the hydrolysis of sucrose involves first breaking the bond between glucose and fructose and then forming new bonds with a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group from water (see FIGURE 6.11). Whenever a reaction rearranges the atoms of molecules, existing bonds in the reactants must be broken and the new bonds of the products formed. The reactant molecules must absorb energy from their surroundings for their bonds to break, and energy is released when the new bonds of the product molecules are formed.

The initial investment of energy for starting a reaction--the energy required to break bonds in the reactant molecules--is known as the free energy of activation, or activation energy, abbreviated EA in this book. It is usually provided in the form of heat that the reactant molecules absorb from the surroundings. The bonds of the reactants break only when the molecules have absorbed enough energy to become unstable. (Recall that systems rich in free energy are unstable, and unstable systems are reactive.) The absorption of thermal energy increases the speed of the reactant molecules, so they are colliding more often and more forcefully. Also, thermal agitation of the atoms in the molecules makes the bonds more likely to break. As the molecules settle into their new, more stable bonding arrangements, energy is released to the surroundings. If the reaction is exergonic, EA will be repaid with dividends, as the formation of new bonds releases more energy than was invested in the breaking of old bonds.

We can think of activation energy as the amount of energy needed to push the reactants over an energy barrier, or hill, so that the "downhill" part of the reaction can begin. FIGURE 6.12 graphs the energy changes for a hypothetical exergonic reaction that swaps portions of two reactant molecules:  The energizing, or activation, of the reactants is represented by the uphill portion of the graph, with the free-energy content of the reactant molecules increasing. At the summit, the reactants are in an unstable condition known as the transition state: They are activated, and the breaking and making of bonds can occur. The bond-forming phase of the reaction corresponds to the downhill part of the curve, which shows the loss of free energy by the molecules. The difference between the free energy of the products and the free energy of the reactants is DG for the overall reaction. Because this is an exergonic reaction, DG is negative.

Fig 6-12. Energy profile of an exergonic reaction. The "molecules" are hypothetical, with A, B, C, and D representing parts of actual molecules. Using the reaction in FIGURE 6.11 as an example, you can imagine that AB = sucrose (glucose monomer--fructose monomer), CD = water (with C = hydroxyl group and D = hydrogen), AC = glucose, and BD = fructose.

As FIGURE 6.12 shows, even for an exergonic reaction, which is energetically downhill overall, the barrier of activation energy must be scaled before the reaction can occur. For some reactions, EA is modest enough that even at room temperature there is sufficient thermal energy for many of the reactants to reach the transition state. In most cases, however, the EA barrier is loftier, and the reaction will occur at a noticeable rate only if the reactants are heated. The spark plugs in an automobile engine energize the gasoline-oxygen mixture so that the molecules reach the transition state and react; only then can there be the explosive release of energy that pushes the pistons. Without a spark, the hydrocarbons of gasoline are too stable to react with oxygen.

Enzymes and Activation Energy

The barrier of activation energy is essential to life. Proteins, DNA, and other complex molecules of the cell are rich in free energy and have the potential to decompose spontaneously; that is, the laws of thermodynamics favor their breakdown. These molecules exist only because at temperatures typical for cells, few molecules can make it over the hump of activation energy. Occasionally, however, the barrier for selected reactions must be surmounted, or else the cell would be metabolically stagnant. Heat speeds a reaction, but high temperature denatures proteins and kills cells. Organisms must therefore use an alternative: a catalyst.

An enzyme speeds a reaction by lowering the EA barrier (FIGURE 6.13), so that the precipice of the transition state is within reach even at moderate temperatures. An enzyme cannot change the DG for a reaction; it cannot make an endergonic reaction exergonic. Enzymes can only hasten reactions that would occur eventually anyway, but this function makes it possible for the cell to have a dynamic metabolism. And because enzymes are very selective in the reactions they catalyze, they determine which chemical processes will be going on in the cell at any particular time.

Fig 6-13. Enzymes lower the barrier of activation energy. Without affecting the free-energy change (DG) for the reaction, an enzyme speeds the reaction by reducing the uphill climb to the transition state. The black curve shows the course of the reaction without an enzyme; the red curve shows the course of the reaction with an enzyme.





 Enzymes are substrate specific

The reactant an enzyme acts on is referred to as the enzyme's substrate. The enzyme binds to its substrate (or substrates, when there are two or more reactants). While enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product (or products) of the reaction. The overall process can be summarized as follows, with the name of the enzyme written above the reaction arrow:  For example, the enzyme sucrase (most enzyme names end in -ase) breaks the disaccharide sucrose into its two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose (see FIGURE 6.11):  An enzyme can distinguish its substrate from even closely related compounds, such as isomers, so that each type of enzyme catalyzes a particular reaction. For instance, sucrase will act only on sucrose and will reject other disaccharides, such as maltose. What accounts for this molecular recognition? Recall that enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional conformations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape.

Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the protein (FIGURE 6.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that reinforces the configuration of the active site. The specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate. The active site, however, is not a rigid receptacle for the substrate. As the substrate enters the active site, it induces the enzyme to change its shape slightly so that the active site fits even more snugly around the substrate (FIGURE 6.14b). This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.

Fig 6-14. The induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. (a) The active site of this enzyme (hexokinase) can be seen in this computer graphic model as a groove on the surface of the protein (blue). (b) On entering the active site, the substrate, which is glucose (red), induces a change in the shape of the protein that causes the active site to embrace the substrate.





 The active site is an enzyme's catalytic center

In an enzymatic reaction, the substrate binds to the active site to form an enzyme-substrate complex (FIGURE 6.15). In most cases, the substrate is held in the active site by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. Side chains (R groups) of a few of the amino acids that make up the active site catalyze the conversion of substrate to product, and the product departs from the active site. The enzyme is then free to take another substrate molecule into its active site. The entire cycle happens so fast that a single enzyme molecule typically acts on about a thousand substrate molecules per second. Some enzymes are much faster. Enzymes, like other catalysts, emerge from the reaction in their original form. Therefore, very small amounts of enzyme can have a huge metabolic impact by functioning over and over again in catalytic cycles.

Fig 6-15. The catalytic cycle of an enzyme. In this example, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose.

Most metabolic reactions are reversible, and an enzyme can catalyze both the forward and the reverse reactions. Which reaction prevails depends mainly on the relative concentrations of reactants and products; that is, the enzyme catalyzes the reaction in the direction of equilibrium.

Enzymes use a variety of mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up a reaction. In reactions involving two or more reactants, the active site provides a template for the substrates to come together in the proper orientation for a reaction to occur between them. As the active site clutches the substrates with an induced fit, the enzyme may stress the substrate molecules, stretching and bending critical chemical bonds that must be broken during the reaction. Because EA is proportional to the difficulty of breaking bonds, distorting the substrate reduces the amount of thermal energy that must be absorbed to achieve a transition state.

The active site may also provide a microenvironment that is conducive to a particular type of reaction. For example, if the active site has amino acids with acidic side chains (R groups), the active site may be a pocket of low pH in an otherwise neutral cell. In such cases, an acidic amino acid may facilitate H+ transfer to the substrate as a key step in catalyzing the reaction. Still another mechanism of catalysis is the direct participation of the active site in the chemical reaction. Sometimes this process even involves brief covalent bonding between the substrate and a side chain of an amino acid of the enzyme. Subsequent steps of the reaction restore the side chains to their original states, so the active site is the same after the reaction as it was before.

The rate at which a given amount of enzyme converts substrate to product is partly a function of the initial concentration of the substrate: The more substrate molecules available, the more frequently they access the active sites of the enzyme molecules. However, there is a limit to how fast the reaction can be pushed by adding more substrate to a fixed concentration of enzyme. At some point, the concentration of substrate will be high enough that all enzyme molecules have their active sites engaged. As soon as the product exits an active site, another substrate molecule enters. At this substrate concentration, the enzyme is said to be saturated, and the rate of the reaction is determined by the speed at which the active site can convert substrate to product. When an enzyme population is saturated, the only way to increase productivity is to add more enzyme. Cells sometimes do this by making more enzyme molecules.





 A cell's physical and chemical environment affects enzyme activity

The activity of an enzyme is affected by general environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, and also by particular chemicals that specifically influence that enzyme.

Effects of Temperature and pH

Recall from Chapter 5 that the three-dimensional structures of proteins are sensitive to their environment. As a protein, an enzyme has conditions under which it works optimally, because that environment favors the most active conformation for the enzyme molecule.

Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the velocity of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Beyond that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active conformation, and the protein molecule denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is fastest. This temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions without denaturing the enzyme. Most human enzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40&#176;C (close to human body temperature). Bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70&#176;C or higher (FIGURE 6.16a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 6-16. Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the active conformation of the protein molecule.

Just as each enzyme has an optimal temperature, it also has a pH at which it is most active. The optimal pH values for most enzymes fall in the range of pH 6-8, but there are exceptions. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, works best at pH 2. Such an acidic environment denatures most enzymes, but the active conformation of pepsin is adapted to the acidic environment of the stomach. In contrast, trypsin, a digestive enzyme residing in the alkaline environment of the intestine, has an optimal pH of 8 (FIGURE 6.16b).

Cofactors

Many enzymes require nonprotein helpers for catalytic activity. These adjuncts, called cofactors, may be bound tightly to the active site as permanent residents, or they may bind loosely and reversibly along with the substrate. The cofactors of some enzymes are inorganic, such as the metal atoms zinc, iron, and copper in ionic form. If the cofactor is an organic molecule, it is more specifically called a coenzyme. Most vitamins are coenzymes or raw materials from which coenzymes are made. Cofactors function in various ways, but in all cases they are necessary for catalysis to take place. You'll encounter examples of cofactors later in the book.

Enzyme Inhibitors

Certain chemicals selectively inhibit the action of specific enzymes (FIGURE 6.17). If the inhibitor attaches to the enzyme by covalent bonds, inhibition is usually irreversible. It is reversible, however, if the inhibitor binds by weak bonds.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 6-17. Inhibition of enzyme activity.

Some reversible inhibitors resemble the normal substrate molecule and compete for admission into the active site. These mimics, called competitive inhibitors, reduce the productivity of enzymes by blocking substrates from entering active sites. This kind of inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate so that as active sites become available, more substrate molecules than inhibitor molecules are around to gain entry to the sites.

So-called noncompetitive inhibitors do not directly compete with the substrate at the active site. Instead, they impede enzymatic reactions by binding to another part of the enzyme. This interaction causes the enzyme molecule to change its shape, rendering the active site unreceptive to substrate or leaving the enzyme less effective at catalyzing the conversion of substrate to product.

Some poisons absorbed from an organism's environment act by inhibiting enzymes. For example, the pesticides DDT and parathion are inhibitors of key enzymes in the nervous system. Many antibiotics are inhibitors of specific enzymes in bacteria. For instance, penicillin blocks the active site of an enzyme that many bacteria use to make their cell walls.

Mentioning enzyme inhibitors that are metabolic poisons may give the impression that enzyme inhibition is generally abnormal and harmful. In fact, selective inhibition and activation of enzymes by molecules naturally present in the cell are essential mechanisms in metabolic control, as we discuss next.





 Metabolic control often dependson allosteric regulation

In many cases, the molecules that naturally regulate enzyme activity in a cell behave something like reversible noncompetitive inhibitors (see FIGURE 6.17c): These regulatory molecules change an enzyme's shape and function by binding weakly to an allosteric site, a specific receptor site on some part of the enzyme molecule remote from the active site. The effect of this allosteric regulation may be either inhibition or stimulation of the enzyme's activity.

Allosteric Regulation

Most allosterically regulated enzymes are constructed from two or more polypeptide chains, or subunits (FIGURE 6.18). Each subunit has its own active site, and allosteric sites are often located where subunits are joined. The entire complex oscillates between two conformational states, one catalytically active and the other inactive. The binding of an activator to an allosteric site stabilizes the conformation that has a functional active site, whereas the binding of an allosteric inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form of the enzyme. The areas of contact between the subunits of an allosteric enzyme fit together in such a way that a conformational change in one subunit is transmitted to all others. Through this interaction of subunits, a single activator or inhibitor molecule that binds to one allosteric site will affect the active sites of all subunits.

Fig 6-18. Allosteric regulation of enzyme activity.

The activity of an allosteric enzyme changes in response to fluctuating concentrations of the regulators. In some cases, an inhibitor and an activator are similar enough in shape to compete for the same allosteric site. For example, some enzymes of catabolic pathways may have an allosteric site that fits both ATP and AMP (adenosine monophosphate), which the cell routinely derives from ADP. Such enzymes are inhibited by ATP and activated by AMP. This is logical because a major function of catabolism is to regenerate ATP. If ATP production lags behind its use, AMP accumulates and activates key enzymes that speed up catabolism. If the supply of ATP exceeds demand, then catabolism slows down as ATP molecules accumulate and compete for allosteric sites. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of key reactions in metabolic pathways.

Feedback Inhibition

The inhibition of an ATP-generating catabolic pathway by the allosteric binding of ATP to an enzyme in the pathway is an example of feedback inhibition, one of the most common methods of metabolic control. Feedback inhibition is the switching off of a metabolic pathway by its end product, which acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme within the pathway. FIGURE 6.19 shows an example of this control mechanism operating on an anabolic pathway. Some cells use this pathway of five steps to synthesize the amino acid isoleucine from threonine, another amino acid. As isoleucine, the end product of the pathway, accumulates, it slows down its own synthesis by allosterically inhibiting the enzyme for the very first step of the pathway. Feedback inhibition thereby prevents the cell from wasting chemical resources to synthesize more isoleucine than is necessary.

Fig 6-19. Feedback inhibition. Many metabolic pathways are switched off by an end product, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of an enzyme earlier in the pathway. This example is the pathway for synthesizing the amino acid isoleucine. (Enzyme 1 is actually a tetramer of four identical subunits, like the hypothetical enzyme in FIGURE 6.18.)

Cooperativity

By a mechanism that resembles allosteric activation, substrate molecules may stimulate the catalytic powers of an enzyme (FIGURE 6.20). Recall that the binding of a substrate to an enzyme can induce a favorable change in the shape of the enzyme's active site (induced fit). If an enzyme has two or more subunits, such an interaction with one substrate molecule can trigger the same favorable conformational change in all other subunits of the enzyme. Called cooperativity, this mechanism amplifies the response of enzymes to substrates: One substrate molecule primes an enzyme to accept additional substrate molecules more readily.

Fig 6-20. Cooperativity. In an enzyme molecule with multiple subunits, the binding of one substrate molecule to the active site of one subunit causes all the subunits to assume their active conformation.





 The localization of enzymes withina cell helps order metabolism

The cell is not just a bag of chemicals with thousands of different kinds of enzymes and substrates wandering about randomly. Structures within the cell help bring order to metabolic pathways. In some cases, a team of enzymes for several steps of a metabolic pathway is assembled together as a multienzyme complex. The arrangement controls the sequence of reactions, as the product from the first enzyme becomes substrate for the adjacent enzyme in the complex, and so on, until the end product is released. Some enzymes and enzyme complexes have fixed locations within the cell as structural components of particular membranes. Others are in solution within specific membrane-enclosed eukaryotic organelles, each with its own internal chemical environment. For example, in eukaryotic cells the enzymes for cellular respiration reside within mitochondria (FIGURE 6.21). If the cell had the same number of enzyme molecules for respiration but they were diluted throughout the entire volume of the cell, respiration would be very inefficient.

Fig 6-21. Organelles and structural order in metabolism. Membranes partition a eukaryotic cell into various metabolic compartments, or organelles, each with a corps of enzymes that carry out specific functions. The organelles shown in this micrograph are mitochondria, the sites of cellular respiration.

The structural basis of metabolic order brings us back to the theme with which this unit of chapters began.





 The theme of emergent properties is manifest in the chemistry of life: a review

Recall that life is organized along a hierarchy of structural levels. With each increase in the level of order, new properties emerge in addition to those of the component parts. In Chapters 2-6, we have dissected the chemistry of life using the strategy of the reductionist. But we have also begun to develop a more integrated view of life as we have seen how properties emerge with increasing order.

We have seen that the unusual behavior of water, so essential to life on Earth, results from interactions of the water molecules, themselves an ordered arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. We reduced the great complexity and diversity of organic compounds to the chemical characteristics of carbon, but we also saw that the unique properties of organic compounds are related to the specific structural arrangements of carbon skeletons and their appended functional groups. We learned that small organic molecules are often assembled into giant molecules, but we also discovered that a macromolecule does not behave like a simple composite of its monomers. For example, the unique form and function of a protein are consequences of a hierarchy of primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. And in this chapter we have learned that metabolism, that orderly chemistry that characterizes life, is a concerted interplay of thousands of different kinds of molecules in an organized cell.

By completing our overview of metabolism with an introduction to its structural basis in the compartmentalized cell, we have built a bridge to Unit Two, where we will study the cell's structure and function in more depth. We will maintain our balance between the need to reduce life to a conglomerate of simpler processes and the ultimate satisfaction of viewing those processes in their integrated context.

The cell is as fundamental to biology as the atom is to chemistry: All organisms are made of cells. In the hierarchy of biological organization, the cell is the simplest collection of matter that can live. Indeed, there are diverse forms of life existing as single-celled organisms. More complex organisms, including plants and animals, are multicellular; their bodies are cooperatives of many kinds of specialized cells that could not survive for long on their own. However, even when they are arranged into higher levels of organization, such as tissues and organs, cells can be singled out as the organism's basic units of structure and function. The contraction of muscle cells moves your eyes as you read this sentence; when you decide to turn the next page, nerve cells will transmit that decision from your brain to the muscle cells of your hand. Everything an organism does occurs fundamentally at the cellular level. This chapter introduces the microscopic world of the cell.

This book takes a thematic approach to the study of life, and the cell is a microcosm that demonstrates most of the themes introduced in Chapter 1. We will see that life at the cellular level arises from structural order, reinforcing the themes of emergent properties and the correlation between structure and function. For example, the movement of an animal cell depends on an intricate interplay of structures that make up a cellular skeleton (green in the micrograph above). Another recurring theme in biology is the interaction of organisms with their environment. Cells sense and respond to environmental fluctuations. As open systems, they continuously exchange both materials and energy with their surroundings. And keep in mind the one biological theme that unifies all others: evolution. All cells are related by their descent from earlier cells, but they have been modified in various ways during the long evolutionary history of life on Earth.





HOW WE STUDY CELLS

 

 Microscopes provide windows to the world of the cell



 

 Cell biologists can isolate organelles to study their functions



It can be difficult to understand how a cell, usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye, can be so complex. How can cell biologists possibly investigate the inner workings of such tiny entities? Before we actually tour the cell, it will be helpful to learn how cells are studied.





A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE CELL

 

 Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in size and complexity



 

 Internal membranes compartmentalize the functions of a eukaryotic cell



Every organism is composed of one of two structurally different types of cells: prokaryotic cells or eukaryotic cells. Only the bacteria and archaea have prokaryotic cells. Protists, plants, fungi, and animals all have eukaryotic cells.





THE NUCLEUS AND RIBOSOMES

 

 The nucleus contains a eukaryotic cell's genetic library



 

 Ribosomes build a cell's proteins



At the first stop of our detailed tour of the cell are two organelles involved in the genetic control of the cell: the nucleus, which houses most of the cell's DNA, and the ribosomes, which use information from the DNA to make proteins.





THE ENDOMEMBRANE SYSTEM

 

 The endoplasmic reticulum manufactures membranes and performs many other biosynthetic functions



 

 The Golgi apparatus finishes, sorts, and ships cell products



 

 Lysosomes are digestive compartments



 

 Vacuoles have diverse functions in cell maintenance



Many of the different membranes of the eukaryotic cell are part of an endomembrane system. These membranes are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane segments as tiny vesicles (sacs made of membrane). Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. Moreover, the thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, but may be modified several times during the membrane's life. The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, various kinds of vacuoles, and the plasma membrane (not actually an endomembrane in physical location, but nevertheless related to the endoplasmic reticulum and other internal membranes). We have already discussed the nuclear envelope and will now focus on the endoplasmic reticulum and the other endomembranes to which it gives rise.





OTHER MEMBRANOUS ORGANELLES

 

 Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the main energy transformers of cells



 

 Peroxisomes generate and degrade H2O2 in performing various metabolic functions







THE CYTOSKELETON

 

 Providing structural support to the cell, the cytoskeleton also functions in cell motility and regulation



In the early days of electron microscopy, biologists thought that the organelles of a eukaryotic cell floated freely in the cytosol. But improvements in both light microscopy and electron microscopy have revealed the cytoskeleton, a network of fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm (FIGURE 7.20). The cytoskeleton plays a major role in organizing the structures and activities of the cell.

Fig 7-20. The cytoskeleton. In this TEM, prepared by a method known as deep-etching, microtubules and microfilaments are visible. A third component of the cytoskeleton, intermediate filaments, is not evident here.





CELL SURFACES AND JUNCTIONS

 

 Plant cells are encased by cell walls



 

 The extracellular matrix (ECM) of animal cells functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation



 

 Intercellular junctions help integrate cells into higher levels of structure and function



 

 The cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts



Having crisscrossed the interior of the cell to explore various organelles, we complete our tour of the cell by returning to the surface of this microscopic world, where there are additional structures with important functions. Although the plasma membrane is usually regarded as the boundary of the living cell, most cells synthesize and secrete coats of one kind or another that are external to the plasma membrane.





 Microscopes provide windows to the world of the cell

The evolution of a science often parallels the invention of instruments that extend human senses to new limits. The discovery and early study of cells progressed with the invention and improvement of microscopes in the 17th century. Microscopes of various types are still indispensable tools for the study of cells.

The microscopes first used by Renaissance scientists, as well as the microscopes you are likely to use in the laboratory, are all light microscopes (LMs). Visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses. The lenses refract (bend) the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified as it is projected into the eye, onto photograph film, or onto a video screen. (See the appendix at the back of the book that diagrams microscope structure.)

Two important parameters in microscopy are magnification and resolving power, or resolution. Magnification in microscopy is the ratio of an object's image to its real size. Resolving power is a measure of the clarity of the image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as two separate points. For example, what appears to the unaided eye as one star in the sky may be resolved as twin stars with a telescope.

Just as the resolving power of the human eye is limited, the resolving power of telescopes and microscopes is limited. Microscopes can be designed to magnify objects as much as desired, but the light microscope can never resolve detail finer than about 0.2 micrometer (mm), the size of a small bacterium (FIGURE 7.1). This resolution is limited by the shortest wavelength of light used to illuminate the specimen. Light microscopes can magnify effectively to about 1,000 times the size of the actual specimen; at greater magnifications, the image becomes increasingly blurry. Most of the improvements in light microscopy since the beginning of the 20th century have involved new methods for enhancing contrast, which clarifies the details that can be resolved (TABLE 7.1, p. 110). In addition, scientists have developed methods for labeling particular cell components so that they stand out visually.

Fig 7-1. The size range of cells. Most cells (yellow region of chart) are between 1 and 100 mm in diameter and are therefore visible only under a microscope. Notice that the scale along the left side is logarithmic to accommodate the range of sizes shown. Starting at the top of the scale with 10 m and going down, each reference measurement marks a tenfold decrease in diameter or length.

Table 7-1. Different Types of Light Microscopy: A Comparison

Type of MicroscopyLight Micrographs of Human Cheek Epithelial CellsType of MicroscopyBrightfield (unstained specimen). Passes light directly through specimen; unless cell is naturally image has little contrast.



Phase-contrast. Enhances contrast in unstained cells by amplifying variations in density within specimen; especially useful for examining living, unpigmented cells.Brightfield (stained specimen). Staining with various dyes enhances contrast, but most staining procedures require that cells be fixed (preserved).



Differential-interference-contrast (Nomarski). Like phase-contrast microscopy, it uses optical modifications to exaggerate differences in density.Fluorescence. Shows the locations of specific molecules in the cell. Fluorescent substances absorb short-wavelength, ultraviolet radiation and emit longer-wavelength, visible light. The fluorescing molecules may occur naturally in the specimen but more often are made by tagging the molecules of interest with fluorescent molecules.



Confocal. Uses lasers and special optics for "optical sectioning." Only those regions within a narrow depth of focus are imaged. Regions above and below the selected plane of view appear black rather than blurry. This microscope is typically used with fluorescently stained specimens, as in the example here.Although cells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, the geography of the cell was largely uncharted until the 1950s. Most subcellular structures, or organelles, are too small to be resolved by the light microscope. Cell biology advanced rapidly in the 1950s with the introduction of the electron microscope. Instead of using light, the electron microscope (EM) focuses a beam of electrons through the specimen or onto its surface. Resolving power is inversely related to the wavelength of radiation a microscope uses, and electron beams have wavelengths much shorter than the wavelengths of visible light. Modern electron microscopes can theoretically achieve a resolution of about 0.1 nanometer (nm), but the practical limit for biological structures is generally only about 2 nm--still a hundredfold improvement over the light microscope. Biologists use the term cell ultrastructure to refer to a cell's anatomy as revealed by an electron microscope.

There are two basic types of electron microscopes: the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Cell biologists use the TEM mainly to study the internal ultrastructure of cells. The TEM aims an electron beam through a thin section of the specimen, similar to the way a light microscope transmits light through a slide. However, instead of using glass lenses, the TEM uses electromagnets as lenses to focus and magnify the image by bending the paths of the electrons. The image is ultimately focused onto a screen for viewing or onto photographic film. To enhance contrast in the image, very thin sections of preserved cells are stained with atoms of heavy metals, which attach to certain cellular structures (FIGURE 7.2a).

Fig 7-2. Electron micrographs. (a) This micrograph, taken with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), profiles a thin section of part of a cell from a rabbit trachea (windpipe), revealing its ultrastructure. (b) A scanning electron microscope (SEM) produced this three-dimensional image of the surface of the same type of cell. Both micrographs show motile organelles called cilia. Beating of the cilia that line the windpipe helps move inhaled debris upward toward the pharynx (throat).

The SEM is especially useful for detailed study of the surface of the specimen (FIGURE 7.2b). The electron beam scans the surface of the sample, which is usually coated with a thin film of gold. The beam excites electrons on the sample's surface, and these secondary electrons are collected and focused onto a screen. The result is an image of the topography of the specimen. The SEM has great depth of field, which results in an image that appears three-dimensional.

Electron microscopes reveal many organelles that are impossible to resolve with the light microscope. But the light microscope offers advantages, especially for the study of live cells. A disadvantage of electron microscopy is that the methods used to prepare the specimen kill the cells. Also, these methods may introduce artifacts, structural features seen in micrographs that do not exist in the living cell. (Artifacts can occur in light microscopy, too.)

Microscopes are the most important tools of cytology, the study of cell structure. But simply describing the diverse organelles within the cell reveals little about their function. Modern cell biology developed from an integration of cytology with biochemistry, the study of the molecules and chemical processes of metabolism. A biochemical approach called cell fractionation has been particularly important in cell biology.





 Cell biologists can isolate organelles to study their functions

The goal of cell fractionation is to take cells apart, separating the major organelles so that their functions can be studied (FIGURE 7.3). The instrument used to fractionate cells is the centrifuge, a merry-go-round for test tubes that can spin at various speeds. The most powerful machines, called ultracentrifuges, can spin as fast as 130,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and apply forces on particles of more than 1 million times the force of gravity (1,000,000 g).

Fig 7-3. Cell fractionation. Disrupted cells are centrifuged at various speeds and durations to isolate (fractionate) components of different sizes. By determining which cell fractions are associated with particular metabolic processes, researchers can tie those functions to certain organelles.

Fractionation begins with homogenization, the disruption of cells. The objective is to break the cells apart without damaging their organelles. Spinning the soupy homogenate in a centrifuge at low speed separates the parts of the cell into two fractions: the pellet, consisting of the larger, heavier structures that become packed at the bottom of the test tube; and the supernatant, consisting of the smaller, lighter parts of the cell suspended in the liquid above the pellet. The supernatant is decanted into another tube and centrifuged again at a higher speed. The process is repeated, increasing the speed with each step, collecting smaller and smaller components of the homogenized cells in successive pellets.

Cell fractionation enables the researcher to prepare specific components of cells in bulk quantity in order to study their composition and functions. By following this approach, biologists have been able to assign various functions of the cell to the different organelles, a task that would be far more difficult with intact cells. For example, one cellular fraction collected by centrifugation has enzymes that function in the metabolic process known as cellular respiration. The electron microscope reveals this fraction to be very rich in the organelles called mitochondria. This evidence helped cell biologists determine that mitochondria are the sites of cellular respiration. Cytology and biochemistry complement each other in correlating cellular structure and function.





 Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in size and complexity

All cells have several basic features in common: They are all bounded by a membrane, called a plasma membrane. Within the membrane is a semifluid substance, cytosol, in which organelles are found. All cells contain chromosomes, carrying genes in the form of DNA. And all cells have ribosomes, tiny organelles that make proteins according to instructions from the genes.

A major difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, indicated by their names, is that the chromosomes of a eukaryotic cell are located in a membrane-enclosed organelle called the nucleus. The word prokaryotic is from the Greek pro, before, and karyon, kernel, referring here to the nucleus. In a prokaryotic cell (FIGURE 7.4), the DNA is concentrated in a region called the nucleoid, but no membrane separates this region from the rest of the cell. In contrast, the eukaryotic cell (Greek eu, true, and karyon) has a true nucleus, bounded by a membranous nuclear envelope (see FIGURES 7.7 and 7.8, pp. 114-115). The entire region between the nucleus and the plasma membrane is called the cytoplasm, a term also used for the interior of a prokaryotic cell. Within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell, suspended in cytosol, are a variety of membrane-bounded organelles of specialized form and function. These are absent in prokaryotic cells. Thus, the presence or absence of a true nucleus is just one example of the disparity in structural complexity between the two types of cells.

Fig 7-4. A prokaryotic cell. Lacking a true nucleus and the other membrane-enclosed organelles of the eukaryotic cell, the prokaryotic cell is much simpler in structure. Only organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea have prokaryotic cells.

Fig 7-7. Overview of an animal cell. This drawing of an animal cell incorporates the most common structures of animal cells (no cell actually looks just like this). The cell has a variety of organelles ("little organs"), many of which are bounded by membranes. The most prominent organelle in an animal cell is usually the nucleus. Most of the cell's metabolic activities occur in the cytoplasm, the entire region between the nucleus and the plasma membrane. The cytoplasm contains many organelles suspended in a semifluid medium, the cytosol. Pervading much of the cytoplasm is a labyrinth of membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Fig 7-8. Overview of a plant cell. This drawing of a generalized plant cell reveals the similarities and differences between an animal cell and a plant cell. In addition to most of the features seen in an animal cell, a plant cell has membrane-enclosed organelles called plastids. The most important type of plastid is the chloroplast, which carries out photosynthesis. Many plant cells have a large central vacuole. Outside a plant cell's plasma membrane is a thick cell wall, perforated by channels called plasmodesmata.

Eukaryotic cells are generally much bigger than prokaryotic cells (see FIGURE 7.1). Size is a general aspect of cell structure that relates to function. The logistics of carrying out metabolism set limits on cell size. At the lower limit, the smallest cells known are bacteria called mycoplasmas, which have diameters between 0.1 and 1.0 mm. These are perhaps the smallest packages with enough DNA to program metabolism and enough enzymes and other cellular equipment to carry out the activities necessary for a cell to sustain itself and reproduce. Most bacteria are 1-10 mm in diameter, a dimension about ten times bigger than that of mycoplasmas. Eukaryotic cells are typically 10-100 mm in diameter, ten times bigger than bacteria.

Metabolic requirements also impose upper limits on the size that is practical for a single cell. As an object of a particular shape increases in size, its volume grows proportionately more than its surface area. (Area is proportional to a linear dimension squared, whereas volume is proportional to the linear dimension cubed.) Thus, the smaller the object, the greater its ratio of surface area to volume (FIGURE 7.5).

Fig 7-5. Geometric relationships explain why most cells are microscopic. In this diagram, cells are represented as boxes. Using arbitrary units of length, we can calculate the cell's surface area (in square units), volume (in cubic units), and surface-to-volume ratio. A high surface-to-volume ratio facilitates the exchange of materials between a cell and its environment.

At the boundary of every cell, the plasma membrane functions as a selective barrier that allows sufficient passage of oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to service the entire volume of the cell (FIGURE 7.6). For each square micrometer of membrane, only so much of a particular substance can cross per second. Rates of chemical exchange with the extracellular environment might be inadequate to maintain a cell with a very large cytoplasm. The need for a surface sufficiently large to accommodate the volume helps explain the microscopic size of most cells. Larger organisms do not generally have larger cells than smaller organisms--simply more cells.

Fig 7-6. The plasma membrane. The plasma membrane and the membranes of organelles consist of a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids with various proteins attached to or embedded in it. The phospholipid tails in the interior of a membrane are hydrophobic; the phospholipid heads, the exterior proteins and parts of proteins, and any carbohydrate side chains are hydrophilic and in contact with the aqueous solution on either side of the membrane. Carbohydrate side chains are found only on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. The specific functions of a membrane depend on the kinds of phospholipids and proteins present.

Prokaryotic cells will be described in detail in Chapters 18 and 27, and the possible evolutionary relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells will be discussed in Chapter 28. Most of the discussion of cell structure that follows in this chapter applies to eukaryotic cells.





 Internal membranes compartmentalize the functions of a eukaryotic cell

In addition to the plasma membrane at its outer surface, a eukaryotic cell has extensive and elaborately arranged internal membranes, which partition the cell into compartments--the membranous organelles mentioned earlier. These membranes also participate directly in the cell's metabolism; many enzymes are built right into the membranes. Because the cell's compartments provide different local environments that facilitate specific metabolic functions, incompatible processes can go on simultaneously inside the same cell.

Membranes of various kinds are fundamental to the organization of the cell. In general, biological membranes consist of a double layer of phospholipids and other lipids. Embedded in this lipid bilayer or attached to its surfaces are diverse proteins (see FIGURE 7.6). However, each type of membrane has a unique composition of lipids and proteins suited to that membrane's specific functions. For example, enzymes embedded in the membranes of the organelles called mitochondria function in cellular respiration.

Before continuing with this chapter, examine the overviews of eukaryotic cells in FIGURES 7.7 and 7.8 on these two pages. These figures introduce the various organelles and provide a map of the cell for the detailed tour upon which we will now embark. FIGURES 7.7 and 7.8 also contrast animal and plant cells. As eukaryotic cells, they have much more in common than either has with any prokaryote. As you will see, however, there are important differences between plant and animal cells.





 The nucleus contains a eukaryotic cell's genetic library

The nucleus contains most of the genes in the eukaryotic cell (some genes are located in mitochondria and chloroplasts). It is generally the most conspicuous organelle in a eukaryotic cell, averaging about 5 mm in diameter. The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus (FIGURE 7.9), separating its contents from the cytoplasm.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 7-9. The nucleus and its envelope. Within the nucleus is chromatin, consisting of DNA and proteins. When a cell prepares to divide, individual chromosomes become visible as the chromatin condenses. The nucleolus functions in ribosome synthesis. The nuclear envelope, which consists of two membranes separated by a narrow space, is perforated with pores and lined by a nuclear lamina.

The nuclear envelope is a double membrane. The two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins, are separated by a space of about 20-40 nm. The envelope is perforated by pores that are about 100 nm in diameter. At the lip of each pore, the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are fused. An intricate protein structure called a pore complex lines each pore and regulates the entry and exit of certain large macromolecules and particles. Except at the pores, the nuclear side of the envelope is lined by the nuclear lamina, a netlike array of protein filaments (intermediate filaments) that maintains the shape of the nucleus. There is also much evidence for a nuclear matrix, a framework of fibers extending throughout the nuclear interior. (We will examine possible functions of the nuclear lamina and matrix in Chapter 19.)

Within the nucleus, the DNA is organized along with proteins into a fibrous material called chromatin. Stained chromatin usually appears through both light microscopes and electron microscopes as a diffuse mass. As a cell prepares to divide (reproduce), however, the thin chromatin fibers coil up (condense), becoming thick enough to be discerned as separate structures called chromosomes. Each eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. A typical human cell, for example, has 46 chromosomes in its nucleus; the exceptions are the sex cells (eggs and sperm), which have only 23 chromosomes in humans.

A prominent structure within the nondividing nucleus is the nucleolus, which appears through the electron microscope as a mass of densely stained granules and fibers adjoining part of the chromatin. Here a special type of RNA called ribosomal RNA is synthesized and assembled with proteins imported from the cytoplasm into the main components of ribosomes, called ribosomal subunits. These subunits then pass through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm, where they can combine to form ribosomes. Sometimes there are two or more nucleoli; the number depends on the species and the stage in the cell's reproductive cycle.

As we saw in FIGURE 5.28, the nucleus directs protein synthesis by synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) and sending it to the cytoplasm via the nuclear pores. The mRNA is made according to instructions provided by the DNA (as is ribosomal RNA). Once an mRNA molecule reaches the cytoplasm, ribosomes translate its genetic message into the primary structure of a specific polypeptide. This process of translating genetic information is described in detail in Chapter 17.





 Ribosomes build a cell's proteins

Ribosomes, particles made of ribosomal RNA and protein, are the organelles that carry out protein synthesis; each is composed of two subunits (FIGURE 7.10). Cells that have high rates of protein synthesis have a particularly large number of ribosomes. For example, a human pancreas cell has a few million ribosomes. Not surprisingly, cells active in protein synthesis also have prominent nucleoli. (Keep in mind that both nucleoli and ribosomes, unlike most other organelles, are not enclosed in membrane.)



Click image to enlarge



Fig 7-10. Ribosomes. (a) This electron micrograph of part of a pancreas cell shows many ribosomes, both free (in the cytosol) and bound (to the endoplasmic reticulum). The bound ribosomes of pancreas cells make a number of secretory proteins, including the hormone insulin and digestive enzymes. Bound ribosomes also make proteins destined for insertion into membranes or the interiors of other organelles. Free ribosomes mainly make proteins that remain dissolved in the cytosol. Bound and free ribosomes are identical and can alternate between these two roles. (b) This simplified diagram of a ribosome shows its two subunits.

Ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic locales (see FIGURE 7.10). Free ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol, while bound ribosomes are attached to the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope. Most of the proteins made by free ribosomes will function within the cytosol; examples are enzymes that catalyze the first steps of sugar breakdown. Bound ribosomes generally make proteins that are destined either for insertion into membranes, for packaging within certain organelles such as lysosomes, or for export from the cell (secretion). Cells that specialize in protein secretion--for instance, the cells of the pancreas and other glands that secrete digestive enzymes--frequently have a high proportion of bound ribosomes. Bound and free ribosomes are structurally identical and can alternate between the two roles; the cell adjusts the relative numbers of each as its metabolism changes. You will learn more about ribosome structure and function in Chapter 17.





 The endoplasmic reticulum manufactures membranes and performs many other biosynthetic functions

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membranous labyrinth so extensive that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in many eukaryotic cells. (The word endoplasmic means "within the cytoplasm," and reticulum is Latin for "little net.") The ER consists of a network of membranous tubules and sacs called cisternae (Latin, cisterna, a reservoir for a liquid). The ER membrane separates the internal compartment of the ER, called the cisternal space, from the cytosol. And because the ER membrane is continuous with the nuclear envelope, the space between the two membranes of the envelope is continuous with the cisternal space of the ER (FIGURE 7.11).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 7-11. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A membranous system of interconnected tubules and flattened sacs called cisternae, the ER is also continuous with the nuclear envelope. (The drawing is a cutaway view.) The membrane of the ER encloses a compartment called the cisternal space. Rough ER, which is studded on its outer surface with ribosomes, can be distinguished from smooth ER in the electron micrograph (TEM).

There are two distinct, though connected, regions of ER that differ in structure and function: smooth ER and rough ER. Smooth ER is so named because its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes. Rough ER appears rough through the electron microscope because ribosomes stud the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. As already mentioned, ribosomes are also attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope's outer membrane, which is confluent with rough ER.

Functions of Smooth ER

The smooth ER of various cell types functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.

Enzymes of the smooth ER are important to the synthesis of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells are the sex hormones of vertebrates and the various steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands. The cells that actually synthesize and secrete these hormones--in the testes and ovaries, for example--are rich in smooth ER, a structural feature that fits the function of these cells.

Liver cells provide one example of the role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrate in the form of glycogen, a polysaccharide. The hydrolysis of glycogen leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the first product of glycogen hydrolysis is glucose phosphate, an ionic form of the sugar that cannot exit the cell and enter the blood. An enzyme embedded in the membrane of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, which can then leave the cell.

Enzymes of the smooth ER help detoxify drugs and poisons, especially in liver cells. Detoxification usually involves adding hydroxyl groups to drugs, making them more soluble and easier to flush from the body. The sedative phenobarbital and other barbiturates are examples of drugs metabolized in this manner by smooth ER in liver cells. In fact, barbiturates, alcohol, and many other drugs induce the proliferation of smooth ER and its associated detoxification enzymes. This, in turn, increases tolerance to the drugs, meaning that higher doses are required to achieve a particular effect, such as sedation. Also, because some of the detoxification enzymes have relatively broad action, the proliferation of smooth ER in response to one drug can increase tolerance to other drugs as well. Barbiturate abuse, for example, may decrease the effectiveness of certain antibiotics and other useful drugs.

Muscle cells exhibit still another specialized function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell is stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium rushes back across the ER membrane into the cytosol and triggers contraction of the muscle cell.

Rough ER and the Synthesis of Secretory Proteins

Many types of specialized cells secrete proteins produced by ribosomes attached to rough ER. For example, certain cells in the pancreas secrete the protein insulin, a hormone, into the bloodstream (see FIGURE 7.10a). As a polypeptide chain grows from a bound ribosome, it is threaded into the cisternal space through a pore formed by a protein in the ER membrane. As it enters the cisternal space, the new protein folds into its native conformation. Most secretory proteins are glycoproteins, proteins that are covalently bonded to carbohydrates. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in the ER by specialized molecules built into the ER membrane. The carbohydrate appendage of a glycoprotein is an oligosaccharide, the term for a relatively small polymer of sugar units.

Once secretory proteins are formed, the ER membrane keeps them separate from the proteins, produced by free ribosomes, that will remain in the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER wrapped in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from a specialized region called transitional ER. Such vesicles in transit from one part of the cell to another are called transport vesicles, and we will soon learn their fate.

Rough ER and Membrane Production

In addition to making secretory proteins, rough ER is a membrane factory that grows in place by adding proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides destined to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are anchored there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also makes its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids from precursors in the cytosol. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred in the form of transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.





 The Golgi apparatus finishes, sorts, and ships cell products

After leaving the ER, many transport vesicles travel to the Golgi apparatus. We can think of the Golgi as a center of manufacturing, warehousing, sorting, and shipping. Here, products of the ER are modified and stored and then sent to other destinations. Not surprisingly, the Golgi apparatus is especially extensive in cells specialized for secretion.

The Golgi apparatus consists of flattened membranous sacs--cisternae--looking like a stack of pita bread (FIGURE 7.12). A cell may have several or even hundreds of these stacks. The membrane of each cisterna in a stack separates its internal space from the cytosol. Vesicles concentrated in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus are engaged in the transfer of material between the Golgi and other structures.

Fig 7-12. The Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of flattened sacs, or cisternae, which, unlike ER cisternae, are not physically connected. (The drawing is a cutaway view.) A Golgi stack receives and dispatches transport vesicles and the products they contain. Materials received from the ER are modified and stored in the Golgi and eventually shipped to the cell surface or other destinations. Note the vesicles joining and leaving the cisternae. A Golgi stack has a structural and functional polarity, with a cis face that receives vesicles containing ER products and a trans face that dispatches vesicles (at right, TEM).

A Golgi stack has a distinct polarity, with the membranes of cisternae at opposite ends of the stack differing in thickness and molecular composition. The two poles of a Golgi stack are referred to as the cis face and the trans face; these act, respectively, as the receiving and shipping departments of the Golgi apparatus. The cis face is usually located near the ER. Transport vesicles move material from the ER to the Golgi. A vesicle that buds from the ER will add its membrane and the contents of its lumen (cavity) to the cis face by fusing with a Golgi membrane. The trans face gives rise to vesicles, which pinch off and travel to other sites.

Products of the ER are usually modified during their transit from the cis pole to the trans pole of the Golgi. Proteins and phospholipids of membranes may be altered. For example, various Golgi enzymes modify the oligosaccharide portions of glycoproteins. Oligosaccharides are first added to proteins in the rough ER, often during the process of polypeptide synthesis. The resulting glycoprotein is then modified as it passes through the rest of the ER and the Golgi. The Golgi removes some sugar monomers and substitutes others, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides.

In addition to its finishing work, the Golgi apparatus manufactures certain macromolecules by itself. Many polysaccharides secreted by cells are Golgi products, including pectins and certain other noncellulose polysaccharides made by plant cells and incorporated along with cellulose into their cell walls. (Cellulose is made by enzymes located within the plasma membrane, which directly deposit this polysaccharide on the outside surface.) Golgi products that will be secreted depart from the trans face of the Golgi inside transport vesicles that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane.

The Golgi manufactures and refines its products in stages, with different cisternae between the cis and trans ends containing unique teams of enzymes. Products in various stages of processing seem to be transferred from one cisterna to the next by vesicles.

Before a Golgi stack dispatches its products by budding vesicles from the trans face, it sorts these products and targets them for various parts of the cell. Molecular identification tags, such as phosphate groups that have been added to the Golgi products, aid in sorting. Finally, transport vesicles budded from the Golgi may have external molecules on their membranes that recognize "docking sites" on the surface of specific organelles or on the plasma membrane.





 Lysosomes are digestive compartments

A lysosome is a membrane-bounded sac of hydrolytic enzymes that the cell uses to digest macromolecules (FIGURE 7.13). There are lysosomal enzymes that can hydrolyze proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids--all the major classes of macromolecules. These enzymes work best in an acidic environment, at about pH 5. The lysosomal membrane maintains this low internal pH by pumping hydrogen ions from the cytosol into the lumen of the lysosome. If a lysosome breaks open or leaks its contents, the released enzymes are not very active, because the cytosol has a neutral pH. However, excessive leakage from a large number of lysosomes can destroy a cell by autodigestion. From this example we can see once again how important compartmental organization is to the functions of the cell: The lysosome provides a space where the cell can digest macromolecules safely, without the general destruction that would occur if hydrolytic enzymes roamed at large.

Fig 7-13. Lysosomes. (a) In this white blood cell from a rat, the lysosomes are very dark because of a specific stain that reacts with one of the products of digestion within the lysosome. This type of white blood cell ingests bacteria and viruses and destroys them in the lysosomes (TEM). (b) In the cytoplasm of this rat liver cell, an autophagic lysosome has engulfed two disabled organelles, a mitochondrion and a peroxisome (TEM).

Hydrolytic enzymes and lysosomal membrane are made by rough ER and then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for further processing. At least some lysosomes probably arise by budding from the trans face of the Golgi apparatus (FIGURE 7.14, p. 122). Proteins of the inner surface of the lysosomal membrane and the digestive enzymes themselves are probably spared from destruction by having three-dimensional conformations that protect vulnerable bonds from enzymatic attack.

Fig 7-14. The formation and functions of lysosomes. The ER and Golgi apparatus generally cooperate in the production of lysosomes containing active hydrolytic enzymes. Lysosomes digest (hydrolyze) materials taken into the cell and recycle materials from intracellular refuse. This figure shows one lysosome fusing with a food vacuole and another engulfing a damaged mitochondrion.

Lysosomes carry out intracellular digestion in a variety of circumstances. Amoebas and many other protists eat by engulfing smaller organisms or other food particles, a process called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat, and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell). The food vacuole formed in this way then fuses with a lysosome, whose enzymes digest the food (see FIGURE 7.14). Digestion products, including simple sugars, amino acids, and other monomers, pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Some human cells also carry out phagocytosis. Among them are macrophages, cells that help defend the body by destroying bacteria and other invaders (see FIGURE 7.13a).

Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's own organic material, a process called autophagy.This occurs when a lysosome engulfs another organelle or a small amount of cytosol (see FIGURE 7.13b). The lysosomal enzymes dismantle the ingested material, and the organic monomers are returned to the cytosol for reuse. With the help of lysosomes, the cell continually renews itself. A human liver cell, for example, recycles half of its macromolecules each week.

Programmed destruction of cells by their own lysosomal enzymes is important in the development of many multicellular organisms. During the transforming of a tadpole into a frog, for instance, lysosomes in the cells of the tail destroy these cells. And the hands of human embryos are webbed until lysosomes digest the tissue between the fingers.

A variety of inherited disorders called lysosomal storage diseases affect lysosomal metabolism. A person afflicted with a storage disease lacks a functioning version of a hydrolytic enzyme normally present in lysosomes. The lysosomes become engorged with indigestible substrates, which begin to interfere with other cellular activities. In Pompe's disease, for example, the liver is damaged by an accumulation of glycogen due to the absence of a lysosomal enzyme needed to break down that polysaccharide. In Tay-Sachs disease, a lipid-digesting enzyme is missing or inactive, and the brain becomes impaired by an accumulation of lipids in the cells. Fortunately, storage diseases are rare in the general population. In the future, it may be possible to cure such a disorder by inserting genes (DNA) for the missing enzyme into the appropriate cells (see Chapter 20).





 Vacuoles have diverse functions in cell maintenance

Vacuoles and vesicles are both membrane-bounded sacs within the cell, but vacuoles are larger than vesicles. Vacuoles have various functions. Food vacuoles, formed by phagocytosis, have already been mentioned (see FIGURE 7.14). Many freshwater protists have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell (see FIGURE 8.13). Mature plant cells generally contain a large central vacuole (FIGURE 7.15) enclosed by a membrane called the tonoplast, which is part of their endomembrane system. The central vacuole develops by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles, themselves derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The vacuole is in this way an integral part of the endomembrane system. Like all cellular membranes, the tonoplast is selective in transporting solutes; therefore, the solution inside the vacuole, called cell sap, differs in composition from the cytosol.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 7-15. The plant cell vacuole. The central vacuole is usually the largest compartment in a plant cell, comprising 80%  or more of a mature cell. The rest of the cytoplasm is generally confined to a narrow zone between the vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) and the plasma membrane. Functions of the vacuole include storage, waste disposal, protection, and growth (TEM).

The plant cell's central vacuole is a versatile compartment. It can hold reserves of important organic compounds, such as the proteins stockpiled in the vacuoles of storage cells in seeds. It is also the plant cell's main repository of inorganic ions, such as potassium and chloride. Many plant cells use their vacuoles as disposal sites for metabolic by-products that would endanger the cell if they accumulated in the cytosol. Some vacuoles contain pigments that color the cells, such as the red and blue pigments of petals that help attract pollinating insects to flowers. Vacuoles may also help protect the plant against predators by containing compounds that are poisonous or unpalatable to animals. The vacuole has a major role in the growth of plant cells, which elongate as their vacuoles absorb water, enabling the cell to become larger with a minimal investment in new cytoplasm. And because the cytosol often occupies only a thin layer between the plasma membrane and the tonoplast, the ratio of membrane surface to cytosolic volume is great, even for a large plant cell.

FIGURE 7.16 reviews the endomembrane system, showing the flow of membranes through the various organelles. As the membrane moves from the ER to the Golgi and then elsewhere, its molecular composition and metabolic functions are modified. The endomembrane system is a complex and dynamic player in the cell's compartmental organization.

Fig 7-16. Review: relationships among organelles of the endomembrane system. The red arrows show some of the pathways of membrane migration. The nuclear envelope is connected to the rough ER, which is also confluent with smooth ER. Membrane produced by the ER flows in the form of transport vesicles to the Golgi, which in turn pinches off vesicles that give rise to lysosomes and vacuoles. Even the plasma membrane expands by the fusion of vesicles born in the ER and Golgi. Coalescence of vesicles with the plasma membrane also releases secretory proteins and other products to the outside of the cell.

We'll continue our tour of the cell with some membranous organelles that are not closely related to the endomembrane system.





 Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the main energy transformers of cells

Organisms are open systems that transform the energy they acquire from their surroundings. In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and chloroplasts are the organelles that convert energy to forms that cells can use for work. Mitochondria (singular, mitochondrion) are the sites of cellular respiration, the catabolic process that generates ATP by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels with the help of oxygen. Chloroplasts, found only in plants and algae, are the sites of photosynthesis. They convert solar energy to chemical energy by absorbing sunlight and using it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water.

Although mitochondria and chloroplasts are enclosed by membranes, they are not part of the endomembrane system. Their membrane proteins are made not by the ER, but by free ribosomes in the cytosol and by ribosomes contained within the mitochondria and chloroplasts themselves. Not only do these organelles have ribosomes, but they also contain a small amount of DNA. It is this DNA that programs the synthesis of the proteins made on the organelle's own ribosomes. (Proteins imported from the cytosol--constituting most of the organelle's proteins--are programmed by nuclear DNA.) Mitochondria and chloroplasts are semiautonomous organelles that grow and reproduce within the cell. In Chapters 9 and 10, we will focus on how mitochondria and chloroplasts function. We will consider the evolution of these organelles in Chapter 28. Here we are concerned mainly with the structure of these energy transformers.

Mitochondria

Mitochondria are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, animals, fungi, and protists. Some cells have a single large mitochondrion, but more often a cell has hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria; the number is correlated with the cell's level of metabolic activity. Mitochondria are about 1-10 mm long. Time-lapse films of living cells reveal mitochondria moving around, changing their shapes, and dividing in two, unlike the static cylinders seen in electron micrographs of dead cells.

The mitochondrion is enclosed by two membranes, each a phospholipid bilayer with a unique collection of embedded proteins (FIGURE 7.17). The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane is convoluted, with infoldings called cristae. The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments. The first is the intermembrane space, the narrow region between the inner and outer membranes. The second compartment, the mitochondrial matrix, is enclosed by the inner membrane. The matrix contains many different enzymes as well as the mitochondrial DNA and ribosomes. Some of the metabolic steps of cellular respiration are catalyzed by enzymes in the matrix. Other proteins that function in respiration, including the enzyme that makes ATP, are built into the inner membrane. The cristae give the inner mitochondrial membrane a large surface area that enhances the productivity of cellular respiration, another example of structure fitting function.

The cutaway drawing shows the two compartments bounded by the membranes: the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix.

Chloroplasts

The chloroplast is a specialized member of a family of closely related plant organelles called plastids. Amyloplasts are colorless plastids that store starch (amylose), particularly in roots and tubers. Chromoplasts have pigments that give fruits and flowers their orange and yellow hues. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll, along with enzymes and other molecules that function in the photosynthetic production of sugar. These lens-shaped organelles, measuring about 2 mm by 5 mm, are found in leaves and other green organs of plants and in algae (FIGURE 7.18).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 7-18. The chloroplast, site of photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are enclosed by two membranes separated by a narrow intermembrane space that constitutes an outer compartment. The inner membrane encloses a second compartment, containing a fluid called stroma. The stroma surrounds a third compartment, the thylakoid space, delineated by the thylakoid membrane. Thylakoid sacs (thylakoids) are stacked to form structures called grana, which are connected by thin tubules between individual thylakoids (TEM).

The contents of a chloroplast are partitioned from the cytosol by an envelope consisting of two membranes separated by a very narrow intermembrane space. Inside the chloroplast is another membranous system in the form of flattened sacs called thylakoids. In some regions, thylakoids are stacked like poker chips; each stack is called a granum (plural, grana). The fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma, which contains the chloroplast DNA and ribosomes as well as many enzymes. Note that the thylakoid membrane divides the interior of the chloroplast into two compartments: the thylakoid space and the stroma. In Chapter 10, you will learn how this compartmental organization enables the chloroplast to convert light energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis.

As with mitochondria, the static and rigid appearance of chloroplasts in micrographs is not true to their dynamic behavior in the living cell. Their shapes are plastic, and they grow and occasionally pinch in two, reproducing themselves. They are mobile and move around the cell with mitochondria and other organelles along tracks of the cytoskeleton.





 Peroxisomes generate and degrade H2O2 in performing various metabolic functions

The peroxisome is a specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane (FIGURE 7.19). Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transfer hydrogen from various substrates to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product, from which the organelle derives its name. These reactions may have many different functions. Some peroxisomes use oxygen to break fatty acids down into smaller molecules that can then be transported to mitochondria as fuel for cellular respiration. Peroxisomes in the liver detoxify alcohol and other harmful compounds by transferring hydrogen from the poisons to oxygen. The H2O2 formed by peroxisome metabolism is itself toxic, but the organelle contains an enzyme that converts the H2O2 to water. Enclosing in the same space both the enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide and those that dispose of this toxic compound is another example of how the cell's compartmental structure is crucial to its functions.

Fig 7-19. Peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are roughly spherical and often have a granular or crystalline core that is probably a dense collection of enzyme molecules. This peroxisome is in a leaf cell. Notice its proximity to two chloroplasts and a mitochondrion. These organelles cooperate with peroxisomes in certain metabolic functions (TEM).

Specialized peroxisomes called glyoxysomes are found in the fat-storing tissues of plant seeds. These organelles contain enzymes that initiate the conversion of fatty acids to sugar, which the emerging seedling can use as an energy and carbon source until it is able to produce its own sugar by photosynthesis.

Unlike lysosomes, peroxisomes do not bud from the endomembrane system. They grow by incorporating proteins and lipids made in the cytosol, and they increase in number by splitting in two when they reach a certain size.





 Providing structural support to the cell, the cytoskeleton also functions in cell motility and regulation

The most obvious function of the cytoskeleton is to give mechanical support to the cell and maintain its shape. This is especially important for animal cells, which lack walls. The remarkable strength and resilience of the cytoskeleton as a whole is based on its architecture. Like a geodesic dome, the cytoskeleton is stabilized by a balance between opposing forces exerted by its elements. And just as the skeleton of an animal helps fix the positions of other body parts, the cytoskeleton provides anchorage for many organelles and even cytosolic enzyme molecules. The cytoskeleton is more dynamic than an animal skeleton, however. It can be quickly dismantled in one part of the cell and reassembled in a new location, changing the shape of the cell.

The cytoskeleton is also involved in several types of cell motility (movement). The term cell motility encompasses both changes in cell location and more limited movements of parts of the cell. Cell motility generally requires the interaction of the cytoskeleton with proteins called motor molecules (FIGURE 7.21). Examples of such cell motility abound. Motor molecules of the cytoskeleton bring about the movements of cilia and flagella by allowing components of the cytoskeleton to slide past each other. The same mechanism causes muscle cells to contract. Vesicles often travel to their destinations in the cell along "monorails" provided by the cytoskeleton. For example, as discussed in the interview with George Langford (pp. 106-107), this is how vesicles containing neurotransmitter molecules migrate to the tips of axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that release these molecules as chemical signals to adjacent nerve cells. It is the cytoskeleton that manipulates the plasma membrane to form food vacuoles during phagocytosis. The streaming of cytoplasm that circulates materials within many large plant cells is yet another kind of cellular movement brought about by components of the cytoskeleton.

Fig 7-21. Motor molecules and the cytoskeleton. The microtubules and microfilaments of the cytoskeleton function in motility by interacting with proteins called motor molecules. Motor molecules work by changing their shapes, moving back and forth something like microscopic legs. ATP powers these conformational changes. With each cycle of shape change, the motor molecule releases at its free end and then grips at a site farther along a microtubule or microfilament.

The most recent addition to the list of possible cytoskeletal functions is the regulation of biochemical activities in the cell. Mounting evidence suggests that the cytoskeleton can transmit mechanical forces from the surface of the cell to its interior--and even, via other fibers, into the nucleus. In one experiment, investigators used a micromanipulation device to pull on certain plasma membrane proteins attached to the cytoskeleton. A video microscope captured almost instantaneous rearrangements of nucleoli and other structures in the nucleus. In this way, the transmission of naturally occurring mechanical signals by the cytoskeleton may help regulate cell function.

Now let's look more closely at the three main types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton (TABLE 7.2). Microtubules are the thickest of the three types; microfilaments (also called actin filaments) are the thinnest; and intermediate filaments are fibers with diameters in a middle range.

SOURCE: Adapted from W. M. Becker, L. J. Kleinsmith, and J. Hardin, The World of the Cell, 4th ed. (San Francisco, CA: Benjamin Cummings, 2000), p. 753.Microtubules

Microtubules are found in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. They are hollow rods measuring about 25 mm in diameter and from 200 nm to 25 mm in length. The wall of the hollow tube is constructed from a globular protein called tubulin. Each tubulin molecule is a dimer consisting of two slightly different polypeptide subunits, a-tubulin and b-tubulin. A microtubule grows in length by adding tubulin dimers to its ends. Microtubules can be disassembled and their tubulin used to build microtubules elsewhere in the cell.

Microtubules shape and support the cell and also serve as tracks along which organelles equipped with motor molecules can move (see FIGURE 7.21). For example, microtubules guide secretory vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Microtubules are also responsible for the separation of chromosomes during cell division (see Chapter 12).

Centrosomes and Centrioles. In many cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosome, a region often located near the nucleus. These microtubules function as compression-resisting girders of the cytoskeleton. Within the centrosome of an animal cell are a pair of centrioles, each composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arranged in a ring (FIGURE 7.22). Before a cell divides, the centrioles replicate. Although centrioles may help organize microtubule assembly, they are not essential for this function in all eukaryotes; centrosomes of most plants lack centrioles altogether.

Fig 7-22. Centrosome containing a pair of centrioles. An animal cell has a pair of centrioles within its centrosome, the region near the nucleus where the cell's microtubules are initiated. The centrioles, each about 250 nm (0.25 mm) in diameter, are arranged at right angles to each other, and each is made up of nine sets of three microtubules. The blue portions of the drawing represent nontubulin proteins that connect the microtubule triplets (TEM).

Cilia and Flagella. In eukaryotes, a specialized arrangement of microtubules is responsible for the beating of flagella and cilia, locomotor appendages that protrude from some cells. Many unicellular eukaryotic organisms are propelled through water by cilia or flagella, and the sperm of animals, algae, and some plants are flagellated. If cilia or flagella extend from cells that are held in place as part of a tissue layer, they function to move fluid over the surface of the tissue. For example, the ciliated lining of the windpipe sweeps mucus containing trapped debris out of the lungs (see FIGURE 7.2).

Cilia usually occur in large numbers on the cell surface. They are about 0.25 mm in diameter and about 2-20 mm in length. Flagella are the same diameter but longer than cilia, measuring 10-200 mm in length. Also, flagella are usually limited to just one or a few per cell.

Flagella and cilia also differ in their beating patterns (FIGURE 7.23). A flagellum has an undulating motion that generates force in the same direction as the flagellum's axis. In contrast, cilia work more like oars, with alternating power and recovery strokes generating force in a direction perpendicular to the cilium's axis.

Fig 7-23. A comparison of the beating of flagella and cilia.

Though different in length, number per cell, and beating pattern, cilia and flagella share a common ultrastructure. A cilium or flagellum has a core of microtubules sheathed in an extension of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 7.24). Nine doublets of microtubules, the members of each pair sharing part of their walls, are arranged in a ring. In the center of the ring are two single microtubules. This arrangement, referred to as the "9 + 2" pattern, is found in nearly all eukaryotic flagella and cilia. (The flagella of motile prokaryotes, which will be discussed in Chapter 27, are entirely different.) Flexible "wheels" of proteins, evenly spaced along the length of the cilium or flagellum, connect the outer doublets to each other and to the two central microtubules (note the radial spokes in FIGURE 7.24c). Each outer doublet also has pairs of side-arms spaced along its length and reaching toward the neighboring doublet; these are motor molecules. The microtubule assembly of a cilium or flagellum is anchored in the cell by a basal body, which is structurally identical to a centriole. In fact, in many animals (including humans), the basal body of the fertilizing sperm's flagellum enters the egg and becomes a centriole.

Fig 7-24. Ultrastructure of a eukaryotic flagellum or cilium.

The motor molecules extending from each microtubule doublet to the next are made of a large protein called dynein. These dynein arms are responsible for the bending movements of cilia and flagella. A dynein arm performs a complex cycle of movements caused by changes in the conformation of the protein, with ATP providing the energy for these changes.

The mechanics of dynein "walking" are reminiscent of a cat climbing a tree by attaching its claws, moving its legs, releasing its front claws, and grabbing again farther up the tree. Similarly, the dynein arms of one doublet attach to an adjacent doublet and pull so that the doublets slide past each other in opposite directions. The arms then release from the other doublet and reattach a little farther along its length. Without any restraints on the movement of the microtubule doublets, one doublet would continue to "walk" along the surface of the other, elongating the cilium or flagellum rather than bending it (see FIGURE 7.21a). For lateral movement of a cilium or flagellum, the dynein "walking" must have something to pull against, as when the muscles in your leg pull against your bones to move your knee. In cilia and flagella, the microtubule doublets seem to be held in place by the protein cross-links between the doublets, the radial spokes, and the other structural elements. Thus, neighboring doublets cannot slide past each other very far. Instead, the forces exerted by the dynein arms cause the doublets to curve, bending the cilium or flagellum (FIGURE 7.25).

Fig 7-25. How dynein "walking" moves cilia and flagella. Powered by ATP, the dynein arms of one microtubule doublet grip the adjacent doublet, pull, release, and then grip again. The doublets cannot slide far because they are physically restrained within the cilium or flagellum, so they bend. For clarity, the two central microtubules and the radial spokes are omitted here.

Microfilaments (Actin Filaments)

Microfilaments are solid rods about 7 nm in diameter. They are also called actin filaments, because they are built from molecules of actin, a globular protein. A microfilament is a twisted double chain of actin subunits (see TABLE 7.2). Microfilaments seem to be present in all eukaryotic cells.

In contrast to the compression-resisting role of microtubules, the structural role of microfilaments in the cytoskeleton is to bear tension (pulling forces). In combination with other proteins, they often form a three-dimensional network just inside the plasma membrane, helping support the cell's shape. This network gives the cortex (outer cytoplasmic layer) of such a cell the semisolid consistency of a gel, in contrast with the more fluid (sol) state of the interior cytoplasm. In animal cells specialized for transporting materials across the plasma membrane, bundles of microfilaments make up the core of microvilli, delicate projections that increase the cell surface area (FIGURE 7.26).

Fig 7-26. A structural role of microfilaments. The surface area of this nutrient-absorbing intestinal cell is increased by its many microvilli, cellular extensions reinforced by bundles of microfilaments. These actin filaments are anchored to a network of intermediate filaments (TEM).

Microfilaments are well known for their role in cell motility, particularly as part of the contractile apparatus of muscle cells. Thousands of actin filaments are arranged parallel to one another along the length of a muscle cell, interdigitated with thicker filaments made of a protein called myosin (FIGURE 7.27a). Myosin acts as a motor molecule by means of projections (arms) that "walk" along the actin filaments. Contraction of the muscle cell results from the actin and myosin filaments sliding past one another in this way, shortening the cell. In other kinds of cells, actin filaments are associated with myosin in miniature and less elaborate versions of the arrangement in muscle cells. These actin-myosin aggregates are responsible for localized contractions of cells. For example, a contracting belt of microfilaments forms a cleavage furrow that pinches a dividing animal cell into two daughter cells.

Localized contraction brought about by actin and myosin also plays a role in amoeboid movement (FIGURE 7.27b), in which a cell crawls along a surface by extending and flowing into cellular extensions called pseudopodia (from the Greek pseudes, false, and pod, foot). Pseudopodia extend and contract through the reversible assembly of actin subunits into microfilaments and of microfilaments into networks that convert cytoplasm from sol to gel. According to a widely accepted model, filaments near the cell's trailing end interact with myosin, causing contraction. Like squeezing on a toothpaste tube, this contraction forces the interior fluid into the pseudopodium, where the actin network has been weakened. The pseudopodium extends until the actin reassembles into a network. Not only do amoebas move by crawling, but so do many cells in the animal body, such as white blood cells.

In plant cells, both actin-myosin interactions and sol-gel transformations brought about by actin may be involved in cytoplasmic streaming, a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells (FIGURE 7.27c). This movement, which is especially common in large plant cells, speeds the distribution of materials within the cell.

Intermediate Filaments

Intermediate filaments are named for their diameter, which, at 8-12 nm, is larger than the diameter of microfilaments but smaller than that of microtubules (see TABLE 7.2 and FIGURE 7.26). Specialized for bearing tension (like microtubules), intermediate filaments are a diverse class of cytoskeletal elements. Each type is constructed from a different molecular subunit belonging to a family of proteins called keratins. Microtubules and microfilaments, in contrast, are consistent in diameter and composition in all eukaryotic cells.

Intermediate filaments are more permanent fixtures of cells than are microfilaments and microtubules, which are often disassembled and reassembled in various parts of a cell. Chemical treatments that remove microfilaments and microtubules from the cytoplasm leave a web of intermediate filaments that retains its original shape. Such experiments suggest that intermediate filaments are especially important in reinforcing the shape of a cell and fixing the position of certain organelles. For example, the nucleus commonly sits within a cage made of intermediate filaments, fixed in location by branches of the filaments that extend into the cytoplasm. Other intermediate filaments make up the nuclear lamina that lines the interior of the nuclear envelope (see FIGURE 7.9). In cases where the shape of the entire cell is correlated with function, intermediate filaments support that shape. For instance, the long extensions (axons) of nerve cells that transmit impulses are strengthened by one class of intermediate filament. The various kinds of intermediate filaments may function as the framework of the entire cytoskeleton.





 Plant cells are encased by cell walls

The cell wall is one of the features of plant cells that distinguishes them from animal cells. The wall protects the plant cell, maintains its shape, and prevents excessive uptake of water. On the level of the whole plant, the strong walls of specialized cells hold the plant up against the force of gravity. Prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists also have cell walls, but we will postpone discussion of them until Unit Five.

Plant cell walls are much thicker than the plasma membrane, ranging from 0.1 mm to several micrometers. The exact chemical composition of the wall varies from species to species and from one cell type to another in the same plant, but the basic design of the wall is consistent. Microfibrils made of the polysaccharide cellulose (see FIGURE 5.8) are embedded in a matrix of other polysaccharides and protein. This combination of materials, strong fibers in a "ground substance" (matrix), is the same basic architectural design found in steel-reinforced concrete and in fiberglass.

A young plant cell first secretes a relatively thin and flexible wall called the primary cell wall (FIGURE 7.28). Between primary walls of adjacent cells is the middle lamella, a thin layer rich in sticky polysaccharides called pectins. The middle lamella glues the cells together (pectin is used as a thickening agent in jams and jellies). When the cell matures and stops growing, it strengthens its wall. Some plant cells do this simply by secreting hardening substances into the primary wall. Other cells add a secondary cell wall between the plasma membrane and the primary wall. The secondary wall, often deposited in several laminated layers, has a strong and durable matrix that affords the cell protection and support. Wood, for example, consists mainly of secondary walls.

Fig 7-28. Plant cell walls. Plant cells first construct thin primary walls, often adding stronger secondary walls to the inside of the primary wall when the cell's growth ceases. A sticky middle lamella cements adjacent cells together. Thus, the multilayered partition between these cells consists of adjoining walls individually secreted by the cells. The walls do not isolate the cells: The cytoplasm of one cell is continuous with the cytoplasm of its neighbors via plasmodesmata, channels through the walls (TEM).





 The extracellular matrix (ECM) of animal cells functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation

Although animal cells lack walls akin to those of plant cells, they do have an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM) (FIGURE 7.29). The main ingredients of the ECM are glycoproteins secreted by the cells. (Recall that glycoproteins are proteins with covalently bonded carbohydrate, usually short chains of sugars.) The most abundant glycoprotein in the ECM of most animal cells is collagen, which forms strong fibers outside the cells. In fact, collagen accounts for about half of the total protein in the human body. The collagen fibers are embedded in a network woven from proteoglycans, which are glycoproteins of another class. Proteoglycan molecules are especially rich in carbohydrate--up to 95% --and they can form large complexes, as shown in FIGURE 7.29. Some cells are attached to the ECM by still other kinds of glycoproteins, most commonly fibronectins. Fibronectins bind to receptor proteins called integrins that are built into the plasma membrane. Integrins span the membrane and bind on their cytoplasmic side to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. Thus, integrins are in a position to transmit changes in the ECM to the cytoskeleton, and vice versa--to integrate changes occurring outside and inside the cell.

Fig 7-29. Extracellular matrix (ECM) of an animal cell. The molecular composition and structure of the ECM varies from one cell type to another. In this example, three different types of glycoproteins are present: proteoglycan, collagen, and fibronectin. Collagen fibers are embedded in proteoglycan complexes, which consist of proteoglycan molecules extending like little trees from long polysaccharide molecules. Fibronectin molecules are the adhesive that attaches the ECM to the plasma membrane of the cell, by connecting to membrane proteins called integrins.

Current research on fibronectins and integrins is revealing the influential role of the extracellular matrix in the lives of cells. Communicating with a cell through integrins, the ECM can regulate a cell's behavior. For example, some cells in a developing embryo migrate along specific pathways by matching the orientation of their microfilaments to the "grain" of fibers in the extracellular matrix. Researchers are also learning that the extracellular matrix around a cell can influence the activity of genes in the nucleus. Information about the ECM probably reaches the nucleus by a combination of mechanical and chemical signaling pathways. Mechanical signaling involves fibronectins, integrins, and the cytoskeleton. Changes in the cytoskeleton may in turn trigger chemical signaling pathways inside the cell. In this way, the extracellular matrix of a particular tissue could help coordinate the behavior of all the cells within that tissue. Direct connections between cells also function in this coordination, as we discuss next.





 Intercellular junctions help integrate cells into higher levels of structure and function

The many cells of an animal or plant are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems. Neighboring cells often adhere, interact, and communicate through special patches of direct physical contact.

It might seem that the nonliving cell walls of plants would isolate cells from one another. In fact, as already mentioned, plant cell walls are perforated with channels called plasmodesmata (singular, plasmodesma; from the Greek desmos, to bind). Cytosol passes through the plasmodesmata and connects the living contents of adjacent cells (see FIGURES 7.8 and 7.28). This unifies most of the plant into one living continuum. The plasma membranes of adjacent cells are continuous through a plasmodesma; the membrane lines the channel. Water and small solutes can pass freely from cell to cell, and recent experiments have shown that in certain circumstances, particular proteins and RNA molecules can also do this. The macromolecules to be transported to neighboring cells seem to reach the plasmodesmata by moving along fibers of the cytoskeleton.

In animals, there are three main types of intercellular junctions: tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. All three types are especially common in epithelial tissue, which lines the internal surfaces of the body. FIGURE 7.30 uses epithelial cells of the intestinal lining to illustrate the junctions. Each kind of junction has a structure well adapted for its function. At tight junctions, the membranes of neighboring cells are actually fused. Forming continuous belts around the cells, these junctions prevent leakage of extracellular fluid across a layer of epithelial cells. In our example, the tight junctions of the intestinal epithelium keep the contents of the intestine separate from the body fluid on the opposite side of the epithelium. Desmosomes (also called anchoring junctions) function like rivets, fastening cells together into strong sheets. Intermediate filaments made of the sturdy protein keratin reinforce desmosomes. Gap junctions (also called communicating junctions) provide cytoplasmic channels between adjacent animal cells. Special membrane proteins surround each pore, which is wide enough for salt ions, sugars, amino acids, and other small molecules to pass. In the muscle tissue of the heart, the flow of ions through gap junctions coordinates the contractions of the cells. Gap junctions are especially common in animal embryos, in which chemical communication between cells is essential for development.

 The cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts

From our panoramic view of the cell's overall compartmental organization to our closeup inspection of each organelle's architecture, this tour of the cell has provided many opportunities to correlate structure with function. (This would be a good time to review cell structure by returning to FIGURES 7.7 and 7.8 on pages 114 and 115.) But even as we dissect the cell, remember that none of its organelles works alone. As an example of cellular integration, consider the microscopic scene in FIGURE 7.31. The large cell is a macrophage. It helps defend the body against infections by ingesting bacteria (the smaller yellow cells). The macrophage crawls along a surface and reaches out to the bacteria with thin pseudopodia ("filopodia"). Actin filaments interact with other elements of the cytoskeleton in these movements. After the macrophage engulfs the bacteria, they are destroyed by lysosomes. The elaborate endomembrane system, which includes the ER and the Golgi apparatus, produces the lysosomes. The digestive enzymes of the lysosomes and the proteins of the cytoskeleton are all made on ribosomes. And the synthesis of these proteins is programmed by genetic messages dispatched from the DNA in the nucleus. All these processes require energy, which mitochondria supply in the form of ATP. Cellular functions arise from cellular order: The cell is a living unit greater than the sum of its parts.

The ability of this macrophage (brown) to recognize, apprehend, and destroy bacteria (yellow) is a coordinated activity of the whole cell. Its cytoskeleton, lysosomes, and plasma membrane are among the components that function in phagocytosis. This and other cellular functions are emergent properties that depend on interactions of the cell's parts (colorized SEM).

The plasma membrane is the edge of life, the boundary that separates the living cell from its nonliving surroundings. A remarkable film only about 8 nm thick--it would take over 8,000 to equal the thickness of this page--the plasma membrane controls traffic into and out of the cell it surrounds. Like all biological membranes, the plasma membrane exhibits selective permeability; that is, it allows some substances to cross it more easily than others. One of the earliest episodes in the evolution of life may have been the formation of a membrane that enclosed a solution different from the surrounding solution while still permitting the uptake of nutrients and elimination of waste products. This ability of the cell to discriminate in its chemical exchanges with its environment is fundamental to life, and it is the plasma membrane that makes this selectivity possible.

In this chapter, you will learn how cellular membranes control the passage of substances. We will concentrate on the plasma membrane, the outermost membrane of the cell, represented in the drawing on this page. However, the same general principles of membrane traffic also apply to the many varieties of internal membranes that partition the eukaryotic cell. To understand how membranes work, we begin by examining their architecture.

 Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition



Lipids and proteins are the staple ingredients of membranes, although carbohydrates are also important. The most abundant lipids in most membranes are phospholipids. Their ability to form membranes is built into their molecular structure. A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region (see FIGURE 5.12). Other types of membrane lipids are also amphipathic. Furthermore, most of the proteins of membranes have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.

How are phospholipids and proteins arranged in the membranes of cells? You encountered the currently accepted model for the arrangement of these molecules in Chapter 7 (see FIGURE 7.6). In this fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a fluid structure with various proteins embedded in or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. We'll discuss this model in detail, starting with the story of how it was developed.

The biological membrane is an exquisite example of a supramolecular structure--many molecules ordered into a higher level of organization--with emergent properties beyond those of the individual molecules. The remainder of this chapter focuses on one of the most important of those properties: the ability to regulate transport across cellular boundaries, a function essential to the cell's existence as an open system. We will see once again that form fits function: The fluid mosaic model helps explain how membranes regulate the cell's molecular traffic.





 Membrane models have evolved to fit new data

Scientists began building molecular models of the membrane decades before membranes were first seen with the electron microscope in the 1950s. In 1895, Charles Overton hypothesized that membranes are made of lipids, based on his observations that substances that dissolve in lipids enter cells much more rapidly than substances that are insoluble in lipids. Twenty years later, membranes isolated from red blood cells were chemically analyzed and found to be composed of lipids and proteins.

In 1917, Irving Langmuir made artificial membranes by adding phospholipids dissolved in benzene (an organic solvent) to water. After the benzene evaporated, the phospholipids remained as a film covering the surface of the water, with only the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids immersed in the water (FIGURE 8.1a). In 1925, two Dutch scientists, E. Gorter and F. Grendel, reasoned that cell membranes must actually be phospholipid bilayers, two molecules thick. Such a bilayer could exist as a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments because the molecular arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids from water while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water (FIGURE 8.1b). Gorter and Grendel measured the phospholipid content of membranes isolated from red blood cells and found just enough of the lipid to cover the cells with two layers. (Ironically, Gorter and Grendel underestimated both the phospholipid content and the surface area of the cells, but the two errors canceled each other. Thus, what turned out to be a correct conclusion was based on flawed measurements.)

Fig 8-1. Artificial membranes (cross sections).

If we assume that a phospholipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane, where do we place the proteins? Although the heads of phospholipids are hydrophilic, the surface of an artificial membrane consisting of a phospholipid bilayer adheres less strongly to water than does the surface of an actual biological membrane. This difference could be accounted for if the membrane were coated on both sides with hydrophilic proteins. In 1935, Hugh Davson and James Danielli proposed a sandwich model: a phospholipid bilayer between two layers of globular protein (FIGURE 8.2a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 8-2. Two generations of membrane models.

When researchers first used electron microscopes to study cells in the 1950s, the pictures seemed to support the Davson-Danielli model. In electron micrographs of cells stained with atoms of heavy metals, the plasma membrane is triple-layered, having two dark (stained) bands separated by an unstained layer (see FIGURE 7.6a). Most early electron microscopists assumed that the stain adhered to the proteins and hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids, leaving the hydrophobic core of the membrane unstained. By the 1960s, the Davson-Danielli sandwich had become widely accepted as the structure not only of the plasma membrane, but of all the internal membranes of the cell. However, by the end of that decade, many cell biologists recognized two problems with the model.

First, the generalization that all membranes of the cell are identical was challenged. Not all membranes look alike through the electron microscope. For example, whereas the plasma membrane is 7-8 nm thick and has the three-layered structure, the inner membrane of the mitochondrion is only 6 nm thick and in electron micrographs looks like a row of beads. Mitochondrial membranes also have a substantially greater percentage of proteins than plasma membranes, and there are differences in the specific kinds of phospholipids and other lipids. Membranes with different functions differ in chemical composition and structure. A second, more serious problem with the sandwich model is in the placement of the proteins. Unlike proteins dissolved in the cytosol, membrane proteins are not very soluble in water. Membrane proteins have hydrophobic regions as well as hydrophilic regions (that is, they are amphipathic). If such proteins were layered on the surface of the membrane, their hydrophobic parts would be in an aqueous environment.

In 1972, S. J. Singer and G. Nicolson advocated a revised membrane model that placed the proteins in a location compatible with their amphipathic character. They proposed that membrane proteins are dispersed and individually inserted into the phospholipid bilayer, with only their hydrophilic regions protruding far enough from the bilayer to be exposed to water (FIGURE 8.2b). This molecular arrangement would maximize contact of hydrophilic regions of proteins and phospholipids with water while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. According to this model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids--hence the term fluid mosaic model.

A method of preparing cells for electron microscopy called freeze-fracture has demonstrated visually that proteins are indeed embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane (FIGURE 8.3). Freeze-fracture splits a membrane along the middle of the phospholipid bilayer. When the halves of the fractured membrane are viewed in the electron microscope, the interior of the bilayer appears cobblestoned, with protein particles interspersed in a smooth matrix, as in the fluid mosaic model. Other kinds of evidence further support this arrangement.

Fig 8-3. Freeze-fracture and freeze-etch. With this method, the two-layer plasma membrane (or other cell membrane) can be split into its two layers. When the separated layers are examined with an electron microscope, the ultrastructure of the membrane's interior is revealed.

Models are proposed by scientists as hypotheses, ways of organizing and explaining existing information. Replacing one model of membrane structure with another does not imply that the original model was worthless. The acceptance or rejection of a model depends on how well it fits observations and explains experimental results. A good model also makes predictions that shape future research. Models inspire experiments, and few models survive these tests without modification. New findings may make a model obsolete; even then, it may not be totally scrapped, but revised to incorporate the new observations. The fluid mosaic model is continually being refined and may one day undergo major revision.

Now let's take a closer look at membrane structure, beginning with the word fluid.





 Membranes are fluid

Membranes are not static sheets of molecules locked rigidly in place. A membrane is held together primarily by hydrophobic interactions, which are much weaker than covalent bonds (see Chapter 5). Most of the lipids and some of the proteins can drift about laterally--that is, in the plane of the membrane (FIGURE 8.4a). It is rare, however, for a molecule to flip-flop transversely across the membrane, switching from one phospholipid layer to the other; to do so, the hydrophilic part of the molecule would have to cross the hydrophobic core of the membrane.

Fig 8-4. The fluidity of membranes.

The lateral movement of phospholipids within the membrane is rapid, averaging about 2 mm--the length of a typical bacterial cell--per second. Proteins are much larger than lipids and move more slowly, but some membrane proteins do, in fact, drift (FIGURE 8.5). And some membrane proteins seem to move in a highly directed manner, perhaps driven along cytoskeletal fibers by motor proteins connected to the membrane proteins' cytoplasmic regions. However, many other membrane proteins seem to be held virtually immobile by their attachment to the cytoskeleton.

Fig 8-5. Evidence for the drifting of membrane proteins. When researchers fuse a human cell with a mouse cell, it takes less than an hour for the membrane proteins of the two species to completely intermingle in the membrane of the hybrid cell.

A membrane remains fluid as temperature decreases, until finally the phospholipids settle into a closely packed arrangement and the membrane solidifies, much as bacon grease forms lard when it cools. The temperature at which a membrane solidifies depends on the types of lipids it is made of. The membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature if it is rich in phospholipids with unsaturated hydrocarbon tails (see FIGURES 5.11 and 5.12). Because of kinks in the tails where double bonds are located, unsaturated hydrocarbons do not pack together as closely as saturated hydrocarbons (see FIGURE 8.4b).

The steroid cholesterol, which is wedged between phospholipid molecules in the plasma membranes of animal cells, has different effects on membrane fluidity at different temperatures (see FIGURE 8.4c). At relatively warm temperatures--at 37&#176;C, the body temperature of humans, for example--cholesterol makes the membrane less fluid by restraining the movement of phospholipids. However, because cholesterol also hinders the close packing of phospholipids, it lowers the temperature required for the membrane to solidify.

Membranes must be fluid to work properly; they are usually about as fluid as salad oil. When a membrane solidifies, its permeability changes, and enzymatic proteins in the membrane may become inactive. Cells can alter the lipid composition of their membranes as an adjustment to changing temperature. For instance, in many plants that tolerate extreme cold, such as winter wheat, the percentage of unsaturated phospholipids increases in autumn, an adaptation that keeps the membranes from solidifying during winter.





 Membranes are mosaics of structure and function

Now we come to the word mosaic. A membrane is a collage of different proteins embedded in the fluid matrix of the lipid bilayer (FIGURE 8.6). The lipid bilayer is the main fabric of the membrane, but proteins determine most of the membrane's specific functions. The plasma membrane and the membranes of the various organelles each have unique collections of proteins. More than 50 kinds of proteins have been found so far in the plasma membrane of red blood cells, for example.

Fig 8-6. The detailed structure of an animal cell's plasma membrane, in cross section. See FIGURE 7.29 for details of the ECM.

Notice in FIGURE 8.6 that there are two major populations of membrane proteins. Integral proteins penetrate the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. Many are transmembrane proteins, which completely span the membrane. The hydrophobic regions of an integral protein consist of one or more stretches of nonpolar amino acids (see FIGURE 5.15), usually coiled into a helices (FIGURE 8.7). The hydrophilic parts of the molecule are exposed to the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Peripheral proteins are not embedded in the lipid bilayer at all; they are appendages loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to the exposed parts of integral proteins (see FIGURE 8.6).

Fig 8-7. The structure of a transmembrane protein. This ribbon model highlights the a-helical secondary structure of the hydrophobic parts of the protein, which lie mostly within the hydrophobic core of the membrane. This particular protein, bacteriorhodopsin, has seven transmembrane helices (outlined with cylinders for emphasis). The nonhelical hydrophilic segments of the protein are in contact with the aqueous solutions on either side of the membrane. Bacteriorhodopsin is a specialized transport protein found in certain bacteria.

On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, some membrane proteins are held in place by attachment to the cytoskeleton. And on the exterior side, certain membrane proteins are attached to fibers of the extracellular matrix (see FIGURE 7.29; integrins are one particular type of integral protein). These attachments combine to give animal cells a stronger external framework than the plasma membrane itself could provide.

Membranes have distinct inside and outside faces. The two lipid layers may differ in specific lipid composition, and each protein has directional orientation in the membrane. The plasma membrane also has carbohydrates, which are restricted to the exterior surface. This asymmetrical distribution of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates is determined as the membrane is being built by the endoplasmic reticulum. Molecules that start out on the inside face of the ER end up on the outside face of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 8.8).

Fig 8-8. Sidedness of the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane has distinct cytoplasmic and extracellular sides, or faces. The extracellular face is topologically equivalent to the inside face of ER, Golgi, and vesicle membranes. Vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is responsible for enlarging the membrane and for secretion of cell products (purple). Carbohydrates on the extracellular surface (green) are synthesized in the ER and modified in the Golgi.

FIGURE 8.9 (p. 144) gives an overview of six major functions exhibited by proteins of the plasma membrane. A single cell may have membrane proteins performing several of these functions, and a single protein may have multiple functions. Thus, the membrane is a functional mosaic as well as a structural one.

 Membrane carbohydrates are important for cell-cell recognition

Cell-cell recognition, a cell's ability to distinguish one type of neighboring cell from another, is crucial to the functioning of an organism. It is important, for example, in the sorting of cells into tissues and organs in an animal embryo. It is also the basis for the rejection of foreign cells (including those of transplanted organs) by the immune system, an important line of defense in vertebrate animals (see Chapter 43). The way cells recognize other cells is by keying on surface molecules, often carbohydrates, on the plasma membrane.

Membrane carbohydrates are usually branched oligosaccharides with fewer than 15 sugar units. (Oligo is Greek for "few"; an oligosaccharide is a short polysaccharide.) Some of these oligosaccharides are covalently bonded to lipids, forming molecules called glycolipids. (Recall that glyco refers to the presence of carbohydrate.) Most, however, are covalently bonded to proteins, which are thereby glycoproteins (see FIGURE 8.6).

The oligosaccharides on the external side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell's surface enable oligosaccharides to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another. For example, the four human blood groups designated A, B, AB, and O reflect variation in the oligosaccharides on the surface of red blood cells.





 A membrane's molecular organization results in selective permeability

A steady traffic of small molecules and ions moves across the plasma membrane in both directions. Consider the chemical exchanges between a muscle cell and the extracellular fluid that bathes it. Sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients enter the cell, and metabolic waste products leave. The cell takes in oxygen for cellular respiration and expels carbon dioxide. It also regulates its concentrations of inorganic ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-, by shuttling them one way or the other across the plasma membrane. Although traffic through the membrane is extensive, cell membranes are selectively permeable, and substances do not cross the barrier indiscriminately. The cell is able to take up many varieties of small molecules and ions and exclude others. Moreover, substances that move through the membrane do so at different rates.

Permeability of the Lipid Bilayer

Hydrophobic molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, can dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it with ease. However, the hydrophobic core of the membrane impedes the transport of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic. Even water, a very small polar molecule, does not easily pass through a lipid bilayer, nor do glucose and other sugars, which are considerably larger. Similarly, a charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water also find the hydrophobic layer of the membrane difficult to penetrate. Fortunately, the lipid bilayer is only part of the story of a membrane's selective permeability. Proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport.

Transport Proteins

Cell membranes are permeable to specific ions and polar molecules, including water. These hydrophilic substances avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane (see FIGURE 8.9, top). Some transport proteins function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane. Other transport proteins hold onto their passengers and physically move them across the membrane. In both cases, the transport protein is specific for the substances it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance or class of closely related substances to cross the membrane. For example, glucose carried in blood to the human liver enters liver cells rapidly through specific transport proteins in the plasma membrane. The protein is so selective that it even rejects fructose, a structural isomer of glucose.

Thus, the selective permeability of a membrane depends on both the discriminating barrier of the lipid bilayer and the specific transport proteins built into the membrane. But what determines the direction of traffic across a membrane? At a given time, will a particular substance enter the cell or leave? And what mechanisms actually drive molecules across membranes? We will address these questions next as we explore two modes of membrane traffic: passive transport and active transport.





 Passive transport is diffusion across a membrane

Molecules have intrinsic kinetic energy called thermal motion (heat). One result of thermal motion is diffusion, the tendency for molecules of any substance to spread out into the available space. Each molecule moves randomly, yet diffusion of a population of molecules may be directional. For example, imagine a membrane separating pure water from a solution of a dye in water. Assume that this membrane is permeable to the dye molecules (FIGURE 8.10a). Each dye molecule wanders randomly, but there will be a net movement of the dye molecules across the membrane to the side that began as pure water. The spreading of the dye across the membrane will continue until both solutions have equal concentrations of the dye. Once that point is reached, there will be a dynamic equilibrium, with as many dye molecules crossing the membrane in one direction as in the other each second.

Fig 8-10. The diffusion of solutes across membranes.

We can now state a simple rule of diffusion: In the absence of other forces, a substance will diffuse from where it is more concentrated to where it is less concentrated. Put another way, any substance will diffuse down its concentration gradient. No work must be done to make this happen; diffusion is a spontaneous process because it decreases free energy (see FIGURE 6.5b). Recall that in any system there is a tendency for entropy, or disorder, to increase. Diffusion of a solute in water increases entropy by producing a more random mixture than exists when there are localized concentrations of the solute. It is important to note that each substance diffuses down its own concentration gradient, unaffected by the concentration differences of other substances (FIGURE 8.10b).

Much of the traffic across cell membranes occurs by diffusion. When a substance is more concentrated on one side of a membrane than on the other, there is a tendency for the substance to diffuse across the membrane down its concentration gradient (assuming that the membrane is permeable to that substance). One important example is the uptake of oxygen by a cell performing cellular respiration. Dissolved oxygen diffuses into the cell across the plasma membrane. As long as cellular respiration consumes the O2 as it enters, diffusion into the cell will continue, because the concentration gradient favors movement in that direction.

The diffusion of a substance across a biological membrane is called passive transport because the cell does not have to expend energy to make it happen. The concentration gradient itself represents potential energy and drives diffusion. Remember, however, that membranes are selectively permeable and therefore affect the rates of diffusion of various molecules. Thanks to the widespread presence of the necessary transport protein, one molecule that diffuses freely across most membranes is water, a fact that has important consequences for cells.





 Osmosis is the passive transport of water

In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with a higher concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic. The solution with a lower solute concentration is hypotonic. (Hyper and hypo mean "more" and "less," respectively, referring here to solute concentration.) These are relative terms that are meaningful only in a comparative sense. For example, tap water is hypertonic to distilled water but hypotonic to seawater. In other words, tap water has a higher solute concentration than distilled water, but a lower concentration than seawater. Solutions of equal solute concentration are said to be isotonic (iso means "the same").

Picture a U-shaped vessel with a selectively permeable membrane separating two sugar solutions of different concentrations (FIGURE 8.11). Pores in this synthetic membrane are too small for sugar molecules to pass but large enough for water molecules to cross the membrane. In effect, the solution with higher solute concentration (hypertonic) has a lower water concentration. Therefore the water will diffuse across the membrane from the hypotonic solution to the hypertonic solution. This diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane is a special case of passive transport called osmosis.*

Fig 8-11. Osmosis. Two sugar solutions of different concentrations are separated by a porous membrane that is permeable to the solvent (water) but not to the solute (sugar). Water diffuses from the less concentrated (hypotonic) solution to the more concentrated (hypertonic) solution. This passive transport of water, or osmosis, reduces the difference in sugar concentrations.

The direction of osmosis is determined only by a difference in total solute concentration. Water moves from a hypotonic to a hypertonic solution even if the hypotonic solution has more kinds of solutes. Seawater, which has a great variety of solutes, will lose water to a very concentrated solution of a single sugar because the total solute concentration of the seawater is lower. If two solutions are isotonic, water moves across a membrane separating the solutions at an equal rate in both directions; that is, there is no net osmosis between isotonic solutions. (In Chapters 36 and 44, we will look at osmosis in a more quantitative way.)





 Cell survival depends on balancing water uptake and loss

The movement of water across cell membranes and the balance of water between the cell and its environment are crucial to organisms. Let's now apply to living cells what we have learned about osmosis in artificial systems.

Water Balance of Cells Without Walls

If an animal cell is immersed in an environment that is isotonic to the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the plasma membrane. Water flows across the membrane, but at the same rate in both directions. In an isotonic environment, the volume of an animal cell is stable (FIGURE 8.12). Now let's transfer the cell to a solution that is hypertonic to the cell. The cell will lose water to its environment, shrivel, and probably die. This is one reason why an increase in the salinity (saltiness) of a lake can kill the animals there. However, taking up too much water can be just as hazardous to an animal cell as losing water. If we place the cell in a solution that is hypotonic to the cell, water will enter faster than it leaves, and the cell will swell and lyse (burst) like an overfilled water balloon.

Fig 8-12. The water balance of living cells. How living cells react to changes in the solute concentrations of their environments depends on whether or not they have cell walls. Animal cells do not have cell walls (top row); plant cells do (bottom row). (Arrows indicate net water movement when the cells are first placed in these solutions.)

A cell without rigid walls can tolerate neither excessive uptake nor excessive loss of water. This problem of water balance is automatically solved if such a cell lives in isotonic surroundings. Seawater is isotonic to many marine invertebrates. The cells of most terrestrial (land-dwelling) animals are bathed in an extracellular fluid that is isotonic to the cells. Animals and other organisms without rigid cell walls living in hypertonic or hypotonic environments must have special adaptations for osmoregulation, the control of water balance. For example, the protist Paramecium lives in pond water, which is hypotonic to the cell. Paramecium has a plasma membrane that is much less permeable to water than the membranes of most other cells, but this only slows the uptake of water, which continually enters the cell. Fortunately, Paramecium is also equipped with a contractile vacuole, an organelle that functions as a bilge pump to force water out of the cell as fast as it enters by osmosis (FIGURE 8.13). We will examine other evolutionary adaptations for osmoregulation in Chapter 44.

Fig 8-13. The contractile vacuole of Paramecium: an evolutionary adaptation for osmoregulation. The contractile vacuole of this freshwater protist offsets osmosis by bailing water out of the cell.

Water Balance of Cells with Walls

The cells of plants, prokaryotes, fungi, and some protists have walls. When such a cell is in a hypotonic solution--when bathed by rainwater, for example--the wall helps maintain the cell's water balance. Consider a plant cell. Like an animal cell, the plant cell swells as water enters by osmosis (see FIGURE 8.12). However, the elastic wall will expand only so much before it exerts a back pressure on the cell that opposes further water uptake. At this point, the cell is turgid (very firm), which is the healthy state for most plant cells. Plants that are not woody, such as most house plants, depend for mechanical support on cells kept turgid by a surrounding hypotonic solution. If a plant's cells and their surroundings are isotonic, there is no net tendency for water to enter, and the cells become flaccid (limp), causing the plant to wilt.

On the other hand, a wall is of no advantage if the cell is immersed in a hypertonic environment. In this case, a plant cell, like an animal cell, will lose water to its surroundings and shrink. As the plant cell shrivels, its plasma membrane pulls away from the wall. This phenomenon, called plasmolysis, is usually lethal. The walled cells of bacteria and fungi also plasmolyze in hypertonic environments.





 Specific proteins facilitate the passive transport of water and selected solutes: a closer look

Let's look more closely at how water and certain hydrophilic solutes cross a membrane. As mentioned earlier, many polar molecules and ions impeded by the lipid bilayer of the membrane diffuse passively with the help of transport proteins that span the membrane. This phenomenon is called facilitated diffusion.

A transport protein has many of the properties of an enzyme. Just as an enzyme is specific for its substrate, a transport protein is specialized for the solute it transports and may even have a specific binding site akin to the active site of an enzyme. Like enzymes, transport proteins can be saturated. There are only so many molecules of each type of transport protein built into the plasma membrane, and when these molecules are translocating passengers as fast as they can, transport is occurring at a maximum rate. Also like enzymes, transport proteins can be inhibited by molecules that resemble the normal "substrate." This occurs when the imposter competes with the normally transported solute by binding to the transport protein. Unlike enzymes, however, transport proteins do not usually catalyze chemical reactions. Their function is to catalyze a physical process--the transport of a molecule across a membrane that would otherwise be relatively impermeable to the substance.

Cell biologists are still trying to learn exactly how various transport proteins facilitate diffusion. Many transport proteins simply provide corridors allowing a specific molecule or ion to cross the membrane (FIGURE 8.14a). The hydrophilic passageways provided by such channel proteins allow water molecules or small ions to flow very quickly from one side of the membrane to the other. In fact, it is water channel proteins, called aquaporins, that facilitate the massive amounts of diffusion illustrated in FIGURE 8.12. Some channel proteins function as gated channels; a stimulus causes them to open or close. The stimulus may be electrical or chemical; if chemical, it is a substance other than the one to be transported. For example, stimulation of a nerve cell by neurotransmitter molecules opens gated channels that allow sodium ions into the cell.

Fig 8-14. Two models for facilitated diffusion.

Not all transport proteins are channel proteins. Many transport proteins seem to undergo a subtle change in shape that somehow translocates the solute-binding site across the membrane (FIGURE 8.14b). The changes in shape could be triggered by the binding and release of the transported molecule.

In certain inherited diseases, specific transport systems are either defective or missing altogether. An example is cystinuria, a human disease characterized by the absence of a protein that transports cystine and other amino acids across the membranes of kidney cells. Kidney cells normally reabsorb these amino acids from the urine and return them to the blood, but an individual afflicted with cystinuria develops painful stones from amino acids that accumulate and crystallize in the kidneys.





 Active transport is the pumping of solutes against their gradients

Despite the help of transport proteins, facilitated diffusion is still considered passive transport because the solute is moving down its concentration gradient. Facilitated diffusion speeds the transport of a solute by providing an efficient passage through the membrane, but it does not alter the direction of transport. Some transport proteins, however, can move solutes against their concentration gradients, across the plasma membrane from the side where they are less concentrated to the side where they are more concentrated. This transport is "uphill" and therefore requires work. To pump a molecule across a membrane against its gradient, the cell must expend its own metabolic energy; therefore, this type of membrane traffic is called active transport.

Active transport is a major factor in the ability of a cell to maintain internal concentrations of small molecules that differ from concentrations in its environment. For example, compared to its surroundings, an animal cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions and a much lower concentration of sodium ions. The plasma membrane helps maintain these steep gradients by pumping sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell.

The work of active transport is performed by specific proteins embedded in membranes. As in other types of cellular work, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP can power active transport is by transferring its terminal phosphate group directly to the transport protein. This may induce the protein to change its conformation in a manner that translocates a solute bound to the protein across the membrane. One transport system that works this way is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges sodium (Na+) for potassium (K+) across the plasma membrane of animal cells (FIGURE 8.15). FIGURE 8.16 (p. 150) reviews the distinction between passive transport and active transport.

Fig 8-15. The sodium-potassium pump: a specific case of active transport. This transport system pumps ions against steep concentration gradients. The pump oscillates between two conformational states in a pumping cycle that translocates three Na+ ions out of the cell for every two K+ ions pumped into the cell. ATP powers the changes in conformation by phosphorylating the transport protein (that is, by transferring a phosphate group to the protein).

Fig 8-16. Review: passive and active transport compared.





 Some ion pumps generate voltage across membranes

All cells have voltages across their plasma membranes. Voltage is electrical potential energy--a separation of opposite charges. The cytoplasm of a cell is negative in charge compared to the extracellular fluid because of an unequal distribution of anions and cations on opposite sides of the membrane. The voltage across a membrane, called a membrane potential, ranges from about -50 to -200 millivolts. (The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative compared to the outside.)

The membrane potential acts like a battery, an energy source that affects the traffic of all charged substances across the membrane. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared to the outside, the membrane potential favors the passive transport of cations into the cell and anions out of the cell. Thus, two forces drive the diffusion of ions across a membrane: a chemical force (the ion's concentration gradient) and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ion's movement). This combination of forces acting on an ion is called the electrochemical gradient. In the case of ions, we must refine our concept of passive transport: An ion does not simply diffuse down its concentration gradient, but diffuses down its electrochemical gradient. For example, the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, gated channels that facilitate Na+ diffusion open. Sodium ions then "fall" down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na+ and by the attraction of cations to the negative side of the membrane.

Some membrane proteins that actively transport ions contribute to the membrane potential. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. Notice in FIGURE 8.15 that the pump does not translocate Na+ and K+ one for one, but actually pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it pumps into the cell. With each crank of the pump, there is a net transfer of one positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular fluid, a process that stores energy in the form of voltage. A transport protein that generates voltage across a membrane is called an electrogenic pump. The sodium-potassium pump seems to be the major electrogenic pump of animal cells. The main electrogenic pump of plants, bacteria, and fungi is a proton pump, which actively transports hydrogen ions (protons) out of the cell. The pumping of H+ transfers positive charge from the cytoplasm to the extracellular solution (FIGURE 8.17).

Fig 8-17. An electrogenic pump. Proton pumps, the main electrogenic pumps of plants, fungi, and bacteria, are membrane proteins that store energy by generating voltage (charge separation) across membranes. Using ATP for power, a proton pump translocates positive charge in the form of hydrogen ions. The voltage and H+ gradient represent a dual energy source that can drive other processes, such as the uptake of nutrients.

By generating voltage across membranes, electrogenic pumps store energy that can be tapped for cellular work, including a type of membrane traffic called cotransport.





 In cotransport, a membrane protein couples the transport of two solutes

A single ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of several other solutes in a mechanism called cotransport. A substance that has been pumped across a membrane can do work as it leaks back by diffusion, analogous to water that has been pumped uphill and performs work as it flows back down. Another specialized transport protein, separate from the pump, can couple the "downhill" diffusion of this substance to the "uphill" transport of a second substance against its own concentration gradient. For example, a plant cell uses the gradient of hydrogen ions generated by its proton pumps to drive the active transport of amino acids, sugars, and several other nutrients into the cell. One specific transport protein couples the return of hydrogen ions to the transport of sucrose into the cell (FIGURE 8.18). The protein can translocate sucrose into the cell against a concentration gradient, but only if the sucrose molecule travels in the company of a hydrogen ion. The sucrose rides on the coattails of the hydrogen ion, which uses the common transport protein as an avenue to diffuse down the concentration gradient maintained by the proton pump. Plants use the mechanism of sucrose-H+ cotransport to load sucrose produced by photosynthesis into specialized cells in the veins of leaves. The sugar can then be distributed by the vascular tissue of the plant to nonphotosynthetic organs, such as roots.

Fig 8-18. Cotransport. An ATP-driven pump stores energy by concentrating a substance (here H+) on one side of the membrane. As the substance leaks back across the membrane through specific transport proteins, it escorts other substances (here sucrose) into the cell. In this case, the proton pump of the membrane is indirectly driving sucrose uptake by a plant cell with the help of a protein that cotransports the two solutes.





 Exocytosis and endocytosis transport large molecules

Water and small solutes enter and leave the cell by passing through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane or by being pumped or carried across the membrane by transport proteins. Large molecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides, generally cross the membrane by a different mechanism involving vesicles. As we described in Chapter 7, the cell secretes macromolecules by the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane; this is exocytosis. A transport vesicle that has budded from the Golgi apparatus moves along fibers of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. When the vesicle membrane and plasma membrane come into contact, the lipid molecules of the two bilayers rearrange themselves so that the two membranes fuse. The contents of the vesicle then spill to the outside of the cell (see FIGURE 8.8).

Many secretory cells use exocytosis to export their products. For example, certain cells in the pancreas manufacture the hormone insulin and secrete it into the blood by exocytosis. Another example is the neuron, or nerve cell, which uses exocytosis to release chemical signals that stimulate other neurons or muscle cells (see FIGURE 2.18). When plant cells are making walls, exocytosis delivers carbohydrates from Golgi vesicles to the outside of the cell.

In endocytosis, the cell takes in macromolecules and particulate matter by forming new vesicles from the plasma membrane. The steps are basically the reverse of exocytosis. A small area of the plasma membrane sinks inward to form a pocket. As the pocket deepens, it pinches in, forming a vesicle containing material that had been outside the cell.

There are three types of endocytosis: phagocytosis ("cellular eating"), pinocytosis ("cellular drinking"), and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In phagocytosis, a cell engulfs a particle by wrapping pseudopodia around it and packaging it within a membrane-enclosed sac large enough to be classified as a vacuole (FIGURE 8.19a, p. 152). The particle is digested after the vacuole fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes. In pinocytosis, the cell "gulps" droplets of extracellular fluid into tiny vesicles (FIGURE 8.19b). Because any and all solutes dissolved in the droplet are taken into the cell, pinocytosis is unspecific in the substances it transports. In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis is very specific (FIGURE 8.19c). Embedded in the membrane are proteins with specific receptor sites exposed to the extracellular fluid. The extracellular substances that bind to the receptors are called ligands, a general term for any molecule that binds specifically to a receptor site of another molecule (from the Latin ligare, to bind). The receptor proteins are usually clustered in regions of the membrane called coated pits, which are lined on their cytoplasmic side by a fuzzy layer of protein. These coat proteins probably help deepen the pit and form the vesicle. After the ingested material is liberated from the vesicle for metabolism, the receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane.

Fig 8-19. The three types of endocytosis in animal cells.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis enables the cell to acquire bulk quantities of specific substances, even though those substances may not be very concentrated in the extracellular fluid. For example, human cells use the process to take in cholesterol for use in the synthesis of membranes and as a precursor for the synthesis of other steroids. Cholesterol travels in the blood in particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), complexes of lipids and proteins. These particles bind to LDL receptors on membranes and then enter the cells by endocytosis. In humans with familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited disease characterized by a very high level of cholesterol in the blood, the LDL receptor proteins are defective, and the LDL particles cannot enter cells. Cholesterol accumulates in the blood, where it contributes to early atherosclerosis (the buildup of fat deposits on blood vessel linings).

Vesicles not only transport substances between the cell and its surroundings but also provide a mechanism for rejuvenating or remodeling the plasma membrane. Endocytosis and exocytosis occur continually to some extent in most eukaryotic cells, and yet the amount of plasma membrane in a nongrowing cell remains fairly constant over the long run. Apparently, the addition of membrane by one process offsets the loss of membrane by the other.

Energy and cellular work have figured prominently in our study of membranes. We have seen, for example, that active transport is powered by ATP. In the next two chapters, you will learn more about how cells acquire chemical energy to do the work of life. We'll call membranes back for an encore in these chapters, as they play a major role in how mitochondria and chloroplasts make energy available to cells.

Living is work. Cells organize small organic molecules into polymers, such as proteins and DNA. They pump substances across membranes. Many cells move or change their shapes. They grow and reproduce. Cells must work just to maintain their complex structure, because order is intrinsically unstable. To perform their many tasks, cells require transfusions of energy from outside sources. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight, the energy source for plants and other photosynthetic organisms (FIGURE 9.1, p. 156). Animals, such as the orangutan in the photograph above, obtain fuel by eating plants, or by eating other organisms that eat plants. In this chapter, you will learn how cells harvest the chemical energy stored in organic molecules and use it to regenerate ATP, the molecule that drives most cellular work.

Fig 9-1. Energy flow and chemical recycling in ecosystems. The mitochondria of eukaryotes (including plants and algae) use the organic products of photosynthesis as fuel for cellular respiration, which also consumes the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. Respiration harvests the energy stored in organic molecules to generate ATP, which powers most cellular work. The waste products of respiration, carbon dioxide and water, are the very substances that chloroplasts use as raw materials for photosynthesis. Thus, the chemical elements essential to life are recycled. But energy is not: It flows into an ecosystem as sunlight and leaves as heat.

 Fermentation enables some cells to produce ATP without the help of oxygen



 

 Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways



 

 Feedback mechanisms control cellular respiration



Because most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration is the work of oxidative phosphorylation, our estimate of ATP yield from respiration is contingent upon an adequate supply of oxygen to the cell. Without the electronegative oxygen to pull electrons down the transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation ceases. However, fermentation provides a mechanism by which some cells can oxidize organic fuel and generate ATP without the help of oxygen.





 Cellular respiration and fermentation are catabolic, energy-yielding pathways

Organic compounds store energy in their arrangement of atoms. With the help of enzymes, a cell systematically degrades complex organic molecules that are rich in potential energy to simpler waste products that have less energy. Some of the energy taken out of chemical storage can be used to do work; the rest is dissipated as heat. As you learned in Chapter 6, metabolic pathways that release stored energy by breaking down complex molecules are called catabolic pathways. One catabolic process, fermentation, is a partial degradation of sugars that occurs without the help of oxygen. However, the most prevalent and efficient catabolic pathway is cellular respiration, in which oxygen is consumed as a reactant along with the organic fuel. In eukaryotic cells, mitochondria house most of the metabolic equipment for cellular respiration.

Although very different in mechanism, respiration is in principle similar to the combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine after oxygen is mixed with the fuel (hydrocarbons). Food is the fuel for respiration, and the exhaust is carbon dioxide and water. The overall process can be summarized as follows: 

Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be processed and consumed as fuel, it is traditional to learn the steps of cellular respiration by tracking the degradation of the sugar glucose (C6H12O6): 

This breakdown of glucose is exergonic, having a free-energy change of -686 kcal (-2,870 kJ) per mole of glucose decomposed (DG = -686 kcal/mol); recall that a negative DG indicates that the products of the chemical process store less energy than the reactants.

Catabolic pathways do not directly move flagella, pump solutes across membranes, polymerize monomers, or perform other cellular work. Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft: ATP. The processes of cellular respiration and fermentation are complex and challenging to learn. Therefore, as you study this chapter, it will help you to keep in mind your main objective: discovering how cells use the energy stored in food molecules to make ATP.





 Cells recycle the ATP they use for work

The molecule known as ATP, short for adenosine triphosphate, is the central character in bioenergetics. Recall from Chapter 6 that the triphosphate tail of ATP is the chemical equivalent of a loaded spring; the close packing of the three negatively charged phosphate groups is an unstable, energy-storing arrangement (because like charges repel each other). The chemical "spring" tends to "relax" by losing the terminal phosphate (see FIGURE 6.8). The cell taps this energy source by using enzymes to transfer phosphate groups from ATP to other compounds, which are then said to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation primes a molecule to undergo some kind of change that performs work, and the molecule loses its phosphate group in the process (FIGURE 9.2). The price of most cellular work, then, is the conversion of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (abbreviated Pi in this book), products that store less energy than ATP. To keep working, the cell must regenerate its supply of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. A working muscle cell, for example, recycles its ATP at a rate of about 10 million molecules per second. To understand how cellular respiration regenerates ATP, we need to examine the fundamental chemical processes known as oxidation and reduction.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 9-2. A review of how ATP drives cellular work. Phosphate group transfer is the mechanism responsible for most types of cellular work. Enzymes shift a phosphate group (P) from ATP to some other molecule, and this phosphorylated molecule undergoes a change that performs work. For example, ATP drives active transport by phosphorylating certain membrane proteins: drives mechanical work by phosphorylating motor proteins, such as the ones that move organelles along cytoskeletal "tracks" in the cell; and drives chemical work by phosphorylating key reactants. The phosphorylated molecules lose the phosphate groups as work is performed, leaving ADP and inorganic phosphate (P) as products. Cellular respiration replenishes the ATP supply by powering the phosphorylation of ADP.





 Redox reactions release energy when electrons move closer to electronegative atoms

Just what happens when catabolic pathways decompose glucose and other organic fuels? And why do these metabolic pathways yield energy? The answers are based on the transfer of electrons during the chemical reactions. The relocation of electrons releases the energy stored in food molecules, and this energy is used to synthesize ATP.

In many chemical reactions, there is a transfer of one or more electrons (e-) from one reactant to another. These electron transfers are called oxidation-reduction reactions, or redox reactions for short. In a redox reaction, the loss of electrons from one substance is called oxidation, and the addition of electrons to another substance is known as reduction.* To take a simple, nonbiological example, consider the reaction between sodium and chlorine to form table salt: 

We could generalize a redox reaction this way: 

In the generalized reaction, substance X, the electron donor, is called the reducing agent; it reduces Y. Substance Y, the electron acceptor, is the oxidizing agent; it oxidizes X. Because an electron transfer requires both a donor and an acceptor, oxidation and reduction always go together.

Not all redox reactions involve the complete transfer of electrons from one substance to another; some change the degree of electron sharing in covalent bonds. The reaction between methane and oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, shown in FIGURE 9.3, is an example. As explained in Chapter 2, the covalent electrons in methane are shared equally between the bonded atoms because carbon and hydrogen have about the same affinity for valence electrons; they are about equally electronegative. But when methane reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, electrons are shifted away from the carbon atoms to their new covalent partner, oxygen, which is very electronegative. Methane has thus been oxidized. The two atoms of the oxygen molecule also share their electrons equally. But when the oxygen reacts with the hydrogen from methane to form water, the electrons of the covalent bonds are drawn closer to the oxygen; the oxygen molecule has been reduced. Because oxygen is so electronegative, it is one of the most potent of all oxidizing agents.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 9-3. Methane combustion as an energy-yielding redox reaction. During the reaction, covalently shared electrons move away from carbon and hydrogen atoms and closer to oxygen, which is very electronegative. The reaction releases energy to the surroundings, because the electrons lose potential energy as they move closer to electronegative atoms.

Energy must be added to pull an electron away from an atom, just as energy must be added to push a large ball uphill. The more electronegative the atom (the stronger its pull on electrons), the more energy is required to keep the electron away from it, just as more energy is required to push a ball up a steeper hill. An electron loses potential energy when it shifts from a less electronegative atom (one with a weaker pull on electrons) toward a more electronegative one, just as a ball loses potential energy when it rolls downhill. A redox reaction that relocates electrons closer to oxygen, such as the burning of methane, releases chemical energy that can be put to work.





 Electrons "fall" from organic molecules to oxygen during cellular respiration

The oxidation of methane by oxygen is the main combustion reaction that occurs at the burner of a gas stove. The combustion of gasoline in an automobile engine is also a redox reaction; the energy released pushes the pistons. But the energy-yielding redox process of greatest interest here is respiration: the oxidation of glucose and other fuel molecules in food. Examine again the summary equation for cellular respiration, but this time think of it as a redox process: 

As in the combustion of methane or gasoline, the fuel (glucose) is oxidized and oxygen is reduced, and the electrons lose potential energy along the way.

In general, organic molecules that have an abundance of hydrogen are excellent fuels because their bonds are a source of "hilltop" electrons with the potential to "fall" closer to oxygen. The summary equation for respiration indicates that hydrogen is transferred from glucose to oxygen. But the important point, not visible in the summary equation, is that the status of electrons changes as hydrogen is transferred to oxygen, liberating energy. By oxidizing glucose, respiration takes energy out of storage and makes it available for ATP synthesis.

The main energy foods, carbohydrates and fats, are reservoirs of electrons associated with hydrogen. Only the barrier of activation energy holds back the flood of electrons to a lower energy state (see FIGURE 6.12). Without this barrier, a food substance like glucose would combine spontaneously with O2. When we supply the activation energy by igniting glucose, it burns in air, releasing 686 kcal (2,870 kJ) of heat per mole of glucose (about 180 g). Body temperature is not high enough to initiate burning, which is the rapid oxidation of fuel accompanied by an enormous release of energy as heat. But swallow some glucose in the form of a spoonful of honey, and when the molecules reach your cells, enzymes will lower the barrier of activation energy, allowing the sugar to be oxidized slowly.





 The "fall" of electrons during respiration is stepwise, via NAD+ and an electron transport chain

The wholesale release of energy from a fuel is difficult to harness efficiently for constructive work: The explosion of a gasoline tank cannot drive a car very far. Cellular respiration does not oxidize glucose in a single explosive step that transfers all the hydrogen from the fuel to the oxygen at one time. Rather, glucose and other organic fuels are broken down gradually in a series of steps, each one catalyzed by an enzyme. At key steps, hydrogen atoms are stripped from the glucose, but they are not transferred directly to oxygen. They are usually passed first to a coenzyme called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Thus, NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent during respiration.

How does NAD+ trap electrons from glucose and other fuel molecules? Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove a pair of hydrogen atoms from the substrate, a sugar or some other fuel. We can think of this as the removal of two electrons and two protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms). The enzyme delivers the two electrons along with one proton to its coenzyme, NAD+ (FIGURE 9.4). The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion (H+) into the surrounding solution:  Though the oxidized form, NAD+, has a positive charge, the reduced form, NADH, is electrically neutral. By receiving two negatively charged electrons but only one positively charged proton, NAD+ has its charge neutralized. The name NADH for the reduced form shows the hydrogen that has been received in the reaction. Since NAD+ gains electrons, it is an electron acceptor (a synonym for oxidizing agent). The most versatile electron acceptor in cellular respiration, NAD+ functions in many of the redox steps during the breakdown of sugar.

Fig 9-4. NAD+ as an electron shuttle. The full name for NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, describes its structure; the molecule consists of two nucleotides joined together. (Nicotinamide is a nitrogenous base, although not one that is present in DNA or RNA.) The enzymatic transfer of two electrons and one proton from some organic substrate to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH. Most of the electrons removed from food are transferred initially to NAD+.

Electrons lose very little of their potential energy when they are transferred from food to NAD+. Each NADH molecule formed during respiration represents stored energy that can be tapped to make ATP when the electrons complete their "fall" from NADH to oxygen.

How do electrons extracted from food and stored by NADH finally reach oxygen? It will help to compare this complex redox chemistry of cellular respiration to a much simpler reaction: the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water (FIGURE 9.5a). Mix H2 and O2, provide a spark for activation energy, and the gases combine explosively. The explosion represents a release of energy as the electrons of hydrogen fall closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Cellular respiration also brings hydrogen and oxygen together to form water, but there are two important differences. First, in cellular respiration, the hydrogen that reacts with oxygen is derived from organic molecules rather than H2. Second, respiration uses an electron transport chain to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps instead of one explosive reaction (FIGURE 9.5b). The transport chain consists of a number of molecules, mostly proteins, built into the inner membrane of a mitochondrion. Electrons removed from food are shuttled by NADH to the "top" end of the chain. At the "bottom" end, oxygen captures these electrons along with hydrogen nuclei (H+), forming water.

Fig 9-5. An introduction to electron transport chains. (a) The uncontrolled exergonic reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to form water releases a large amount of energy in the form of heat and light: an explosion. (b) In cellular respiration, the same reaction occurs in stages: An electron transport chain breaks the "fall" of electrons in this reaction into a series of smaller steps and stores some of the released energy in a form that can be used to make ATP. (The rest of the energy is released as heat.)

Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction with a free-energy change of -53 kcal/mol (-222 kJ/mol). Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electrons cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule to the next, losing a small amount of energy with each step until they finally reach oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor. What keeps the electrons moving is that each carrier is more electronegative than its "uphill" neighbor in the chain. At the bottom of the chain is oxygen, which has a very great affinity for electrons. Thus, electrons removed from food by NAD+ fall down the electron transport chain to a far more stable location in the electronegative oxygen atom. Put another way, oxygen pulls electrons down the chain in an energy-yielding tumble analogous to gravity pulling objects downhill.

Thus, during cellular respiration, most electrons travel this "downhill" route: food  NADH  electron transport chain 8n oxygen. In the next major section of the chapter, you will learn more about how the cell uses the energy released from this exergonic electron fall to regenerate its supply of ATP.





 Respiration involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport: an overview

Respiration is a cumulative function of three metabolic stages, diagrammed in FIGURE 9.6:

Fig 9-6. An overview of cellular respiration. In a eukaryotic cell, glycolysis occurs outside the mitochondria in the cytosol. The Krebs cycle and the electron transport chains are located inside the mitochondria. During glycolysis, each glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of the compound pyruvate. The pyruvate crosses the double membrane of the mitochondrion to enter the matrix, where the Krebs cycle decomposes it to carbon dioxide. NADH or FADH2 (see p. 164) transfers electrons from molecules undergoing glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to electron transport chains, which are built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electron transport chain converts the chemical energy to a form that can be used to drive oxidative phosphorylation, which accounts for most of the ATP generated by cellular respiration. A smaller amount of ATP is formed directly during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle by substrate-level phosphorylation.

Glycolysis (color-coded teal throughout the chapter)

The Krebs cycle (color-coded salmon)

The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (color-coded violet)

The first two stages, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, are the catabolic pathways that decompose glucose and other organic fuels. Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytosol, begins the degradation by breaking glucose into two molecules of a compound called pyruvate. The Krebs cycle, which takes place within the mitochondrial matrix, completes the job by decomposing a derivative of pyruvate to carbon dioxide. Thus, the carbon dioxide produced by respiration represents fragments of oxidized organic molecules.

Some of the steps of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are redox reactions in which dehydrogenase enzymes transfer electrons from substrates to NAD+, forming NADH. In the third stage of respiration, the electron transport chain accepts electrons from the breakdown products of the first two stages (usually via NADH) and passes these electrons from one molecule to another. At the end of the chain, the electrons are combined with hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen to form water (see FIGURE 9.5b). The energy released at each step of the chain is stored in a form the mitochondrion can use to make ATP. This mode of ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation because it is powered by the redox reactions that transfer electrons from food to oxygen.

The site of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation is the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (see FIGURE 7.17). Oxidative phosphorylation accounts for almost 90%  of the ATP generated by respiration. A smaller amount of ATP is formed directly in a few reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle by a mechanism called substrate-level phosphorylation (FIGURE 9.7). This mode of ATP synthesis occurs when an enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP. "Substrate molecule" here refers to an organic molecule generated during the catabolism of glucose.

Fig 9-7. Substrate-level phosphorylation. Some ATP is made by direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from a substrate to ADP. The phosphate donor in this case is phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is formed from the breakdown of sugar during glycolysis.

Respiration cashes in the large denomination of energy banked in glucose for the small change of ATP, which is more practical for the cell to spend on its work. For each molecule of glucose degraded to carbon dioxide and water by respiration, the cell makes up to about 38 molecules of ATP.

This overview has introduced how glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and electron transport fit into the overall process of cellular respiration. We are now ready to take a closer look at each of these three stages of respiration.*





 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate: a closer look

The word glycolysis means "splitting of sugar," and that is exactly what happens during this pathway. Glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is split into two three-carbon sugars. These smaller sugars are then oxidized and their remaining atoms rearranged to form two molecules of pyruvate. (Pyruvate is the ionized form of a three-carbon acid, pyruvic acid.)

As summarized in FIGURE 9.8 and described in detail in FIGURE 9.9 (pp. 162--163) the pathway of glycolysis consists of ten steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. We can divide these ten steps into two phases. The energy investment phase includes the first five steps, and the energy payoff phase includes the next five steps. During the energy investment phase, the cell actually spends ATP to phosphorylate the fuel molecules. This investment is repaid with dividends during the energy payoff phase, when ATP is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by oxidation of the food. The net energy yield from glycolysis, per glucose molecule, is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH.

Fig 9-9. A closer look at glycolysis. The orientation diagram at the right relates glycolysis to the whole process of respiration. Do not let the chemical detail in the main diagram block your view of glycolysis as a source of ATP and NADH.

Notice in FIGURE 9.9 that all of the carbon originally present in glucose is accounted for in the two molecules of pyruvate; no CO2 is released during glycolysis. Glycolysis occurs whether or not molecular oxygen (O2) is present. However, if oxygen is present, the energy stored in NADH can be converted to ATP energy by the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. And in the presence of oxygen, the chemical energy left in pyruvate can be extracted by the Krebs cycle.





 The Krebs cycle completes the energy-yieldingoxidation of organic molecules: a closer look

Glycolysis releases less than a quarter of the chemical energy stored in glucose; most of the energy remains stocked in the two molecules of pyruvate. If molecular oxygen is present, the pyruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the enzymes of the Krebs cycle complete the oxidation of the organic fuel.

Upon entering the mitochondrion, pyruvate is first converted to a compound called acetyl coenzyme A, or acetyl CoA (FIGURE 9.10). This step, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, is accomplished by a multienzyme complex that catalyzes three reactions: 
			  
		 Pyruvate's carboxyl group, which is already fully oxidized and thus has little chemical energy, is removed and given off as a molecule of CO2. (This is the first step in respiration where CO2 is released.) 
			  
		 The remaining two-carbon fragment is oxidized to form a compound named acetate (the ionized form of acetic acid). An enzyme transfers the extracted electrons to NAD+, storing energy in the form of NADH. 
			  
		 Finally, coenzyme A, a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached to the acetate by an unstable bond that makes the acetyl group (the attached acetate) very reactive. The product of this chemical grooming, acetyl CoA, is now ready to feed its acetate into the Krebs cycle for further oxidation.

Fig 9-10. Conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, the junction between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. A complex of several enzymes catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The acetyl CoA will enter the Krebs cycle. The CO2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell.

The Krebs cycle is named after Hans Krebs, the German-British scientist who was largely responsible for elucidating the pathway in the 1930s. The cycle has eight steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme (FIGURE 9.11). You can see in the diagram that for each turn of the Krebs cycle, two carbons enter in the relatively reduced form of acetate (step 1), and two different carbons leave in the completely oxidized form of CO2 (steps 3 and 4). The acetate joins the cycle by its enzymatic addition to the compound oxaloacetate, forming citrate. Subsequent steps decompose the citrate back to oxaloacetate, giving off CO2 as "exhaust." It is this regeneration of oxaloacetate that accounts for the "cycle" in the Krebs cycle. Except for the enzyme that catalyzes step 6, which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane, all the Krebs cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix.

Fig 9-11. A closer look at the Krebs cycle. In the chemical structures, red type traces the fate of the two carbon atoms that enter the cycle via acetyl CoA (step 1), and blue type indicates the two carbons that exit the cycle as CO2 in steps 3 and 4. Notice that carboxylic acids are represented in their ionized forms, as --COO-. For example, citrate is the ionized form of citric acid.

Most of the energy harvested by the oxidative steps of the cycle is conserved in NADH. For each acetate that enters the cycle, three molecules of NAD+ are reduced to NADH (steps 3, 4, and 8). In one oxidative reaction, step 6, electrons are transferred not to NAD+, but to a different electron acceptor, FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, derived from riboflavin, a B vitamin). The reduced form, FADH2, donates its electrons to the electron transport chain, as does NADH. There is also a step in the Krebs cycle, step 5, that forms an ATP molecule directly by substrate-level phosphorylation, similar to the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis. But most of the ATP output of respiration results from oxidative phosphorylation, when the NADH and FADH2 produced by the Krebs cycle relay the electrons extracted from food to the electron transport chain. Use FIGURE 9.12, page 166, to review the inputs and outputs of the Krebs cycle before proceeding to the electron transport chain.

Fig 9-12. A summary of the Krebs cycle. The cycle functions as a metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel derived from pyruvate, the product of glycolysis. This diagram summarizes the inputs and outputs as pyruvate is broken down to three molecules of CO2, and it includes the molecule of CO2 released during pre-Krebs cycle conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate phosphorylation, but most of the chemical energy is transferred during the redox reactions to NAD+ and FAD. The reduced coenzymes, NADH and FADH2, shuttle their cargo of high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain, which uses the energy to synthesize ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. (To calculate the inputs and outputs on a "per-glucose" basis, multiply by 2, because each glucose molecule is split during glycolysis into two pyruvate molecules.)





 The inner mitochondrial membrane couples electron transport to ATP synthesis: a closer look

Our main objective in this chapter is to learn how cells harvest the energy of food to make ATP. But the metabolic components of respiration we have dissected so far, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, produce only four molecules of ATP per glucose molecule, all by substrate-level phosphorylation: two net ATPs from glycolysis and two ATPs from the Krebs cycle. At this point, molecules of NADH (and FADH2) account for most of the energy extracted from the food. These electron escorts link glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation, which uses energy released by the electron transport chain to power ATP synthesis. In this section, you will first learn how the electron transport chain works, then how the inner membrane of the mitochondrion couples ATP synthesis to electron flow down the chain.

The Pathway of Electron Transport

You learned earlier that the electron transport chain is a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The folding of the inner membrane to form cristae increases its surface area, providing space for thousands of copies of the chain in each mitochondrion. (Once again, we see that structure fits function.) Most components of the chain are proteins. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components essential for the catalytic functions of certain enzymes. During electron transport along the chain, these prosthetic groups alternate between reduced and oxidized states as they accept and donate electrons.

FIGURE 9.13 (p. 166) shows the sequence of electron carriers in the electron transport chain and the drop in free energy as electrons travel down the chain. Electrons removed from food during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are transferred by NADH to the first molecule of the electron transport chain. This molecule is a flavoprotein, so named because it has a prosthetic group called flavin mononucleotide (FMN in FIGURE 9.13). In the next redox reaction, the flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to an iron-sulfur protein (FeS in FIGURE 9.13), one of a family of proteins with both iron and sulfur tightly bound. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called ubiquinone (Q in FIGURE 9.13). This electron carrier is a lipid, the only member of the electron transport chain that is not a protein.

Fig 9-13. Free-energy change during electron transport. Each member of the chain oscillates between a reduced state and an oxidized state. A component of the chain becomes reduced when it accepts electrons from its "uphill" neighbor, which has a lower affinity for electrons (is less electronegative). It then returns to its oxidized form as it passes electrons to its "downhill," more electronegative, neighbor. At the bottom of the chain is oxygen, which is very electronegative. The overall energy drop for electrons traveling from NADH to oxygen is 53 kcal/mol, but this fall is broken up into a series of smaller steps by the electron transport chain. The various molecules of the electron transport chain, shown as light purple ovals here, are described in the text. Most of these electron carriers are grouped into multiprotein complexes, shown here and in FIGURE 9.15 in darker purple.

Most of the remaining electron carriers between Q and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes (cyt). Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has four organic rings surrounding a single iron atom. It is similar to the iron-containing prosthetic group found in hemoglobin, the red protein of blood that transports oxygen. But the iron of cytochromes transfers electrons, not oxygen. The electron transport chain has several types of cytochromes, each a different protein with a heme group. The last cytochrome of the chain, cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which also picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from the aqueous solution to form water. (An oxygen atom is represented in FIGURE 9.13 as &#189; O2 to emphasize that the electron transport chain reduces molecular oxygen, O2, not individual oxygen atoms. For every two NADH molecules, one O2 molecule is reduced to two molecules of water.)

Another source of electrons for the transport chain is FADH2, the other reduced product of the Krebs cycle. Notice in FIGURE 9.13 that FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport chain at a lower energy level than NADH does. Consequently, the electron transport chain provides about one-third less energy for ATP synthesis when the electron donor is FADH2 rather than NADH.

The electron transport chain makes no ATP directly. Its function is to ease the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in manageable amounts. How does the mitochondrion couple this electron transport and energy release to ATP synthesis? The answer is a mechanism called chemiosmosis.

Chemiosmosis: The Energy-Coupling Mechanism

Populating the inner membrane of the mitochondrion are many copies of a protein complex called ATP synthase, the enzyme that actually makes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (FIGURE 9.14). ATP synthase works like an ion pump running in reverse. Recall from Chapter 8 that ion pumps use ATP as an energy source to transport ions against their gradients. In the reverse of that process, ATP synthase uses the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP synthesis. The ion gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation is a proton (hydrogen ion) gradient; that is, the power source for the ATP synthase is a difference in the concentration of H+ on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. (We can also think of this gradient as a difference in pH, since pH is a measure of H+ concentration.)

Fig 9-14. ATP synthase, a molecular mill. The ATP synthase protein complex functions as a mill, powered by the flow of hydrogen ions. This complex resides in mitochondrial and chloroplast membranes of eukaryotes and in the plasma membranes of prokaryotes. ATP synthase has three main parts: a rotor, a rod, and a knob. Each part consists of a number of protein subunits.

How does the mitochondrial membrane generate and maintain an H+ gradient? That is the function of the electron transport chain, which is shown in its mitochondrial location in FIGURE 9.15 (p. 168). The chain is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons to pump H+ across the membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The H+ leaks back across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. But the ATP synthases are the only patches of the membrane that are freely permeable to H+. The ions pass through a channel in ATP synthase, and this protein complex uses the exergonic flow of H+ to drive the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP. Thus, an H+ gradient across a membrane couples the redox reactions of the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. This coupling mechanism is called chemiosmosis (from the Greek osmos, push), a term that highlights the connection between the chemical reaction that makes ATP and transport across a membrane. We have previously used the word osmosis in discussing water transport, but here we are referring to the flow of H+ across a membrane.

Fig 9-15. Chemiosmosis couples the electron transport chain to ATP synthesis. NADH shuttles high-energy electrons extracted from food during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to an electron transport chain built into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The gold arrow traces the transport of electrons, which finally pass to oxygen at the "downhill" end of the chain to form water. As FIGURE 9.13 showed, most of the electron carriers of the chain are grouped into three complexes, each represented here by a purple blob embedded in the membrane. Two mobile carriers, ubiquinone (Q) and cytochrome c, move rapidly along the membrane, ferrying electrons between the three large complexes. As each complex of the chain accepts and then donates electrons, it pumps hydrogen ions (protons) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. Thus, chemical energy originally harvested from food is transformed into a proton-motive force, a gradient of H+ across the membrane. The hydrogen ions flow back, down their gradient, through a channel in an ATP synthase, another protein complex built into the membrane. The ATP synthase harnesses the proton-motive force to phosphorylate ADP, forming ATP. (This phosphorylation is called oxidative because it is driven by the loss of electrons from food molecules.) The use of an H+ gradient (proton-motive force) to transfer energy from redox reactions to cellular work (ATP synthesis, in this case) is called chemiosmosis.

If you have followed this complex story of chemiosmosis so far, you should have at least two questions. How does the electron transport chain pump hydrogen ions? And how does the ATP synthase use H+ backflow to make ATP? In answer to the first question, researchers have found that certain members of the electron transport chain accept and release protons (H+) along with electrons. At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause H+ to be taken up and released back into the surrounding solution. The electron carriers are spatially arranged in the membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space (see FIGURE 9.15 again). The H+ gradient that results is referred to as a proton-motive force, emphasizing the capacity of the gradient to perform work. The force drives H+ back across the membrane through the specific H+ channels provided by ATP synthase complexes.

Scientists are also learning how the flow of H+ through ATP synthase powers ATP generation. This new understanding of ATP synthase function has emerged from studies of its molecular structure (see FIGURE 9.14). The ATP synthase complex consists of three main parts: a cylindrical rotor within the inner mitochondrial membrane, a knob protruding into the mitochondrial matrix, and an internal rod connecting the two. When hydrogen ions flow through the cylinder down their gradient, they cause the cylinder and the attached rod to rotate, much as a rushing stream turns a waterwheel. The spinning rod brings about a conformational change in the knob, activating catalytic sites where ADP and inorganic phosphate combine to make ATP.

In general terms, chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that uses energy stored in the form of an H+gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. In mitochondria, the energy for gradient formation comes from exergonic redox reactions, and ATP synthesis is the work performed. But chemiosmosis also occurs elsewhere and in other variations. Chloroplasts use chemiosmosis to generate ATP during photosynthesis; in these organelles, light (rather than chemical energy) drives both electron flow down an electron transport chain and H+ gradient formation. Prokaryotes, which lack both mitochondria and chloroplasts, generate H+ gradients across their plasma membranes. They then tap the proton-motive force not only to make ATP but also to pump nutrients and waste products across the membrane and to rotate their flagella.

Experiments with bacteria first led British biochemist Peter Mitchell to propose chemiosmosis as an energy-coupling mechanism in 1961. Nearly two decades later, after many scientists had confirmed the centrality of chemiosmosis in energy conversions within bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize. Chemiosmosis has helped unify the study of bioenergetics.





 Cellular respiration generates many ATP molecules for each sugar molecule it oxidizes: a review

Now that we have looked more closely at the key processes of cellular respiration, let's return to its overall function: harvesting the energy of food for ATP synthesis.

During respiration, most energy flows in this sequence: Glucose NADH  electron transport chain  protonmotive force  ATP. We can do some bookkeeping to calculate the ATP profit when cellular respiration oxidizes a molecule of glucose to six molecules of carbon dioxide. The three main departments of this metabolic enterprise are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, which drives oxidative phosphorylation. FIGURE 9.16 gives a detailed accounting of the ATP yield per glucose molecule oxidized. The tally adds the few molecules of ATP produced directly by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to the many more molecules of ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation. Each NADH that transfers a pair of electrons from food to the electron transport chain contributes enough to the proton-motive force to generate a maximum of about three ATPs. (The average ATP yield per NADH is probably between two and three; we are rounding off to three here to simplify the bookkeeping.) The Krebs cycle also supplies electrons to the electron transport chain via FADH2, but each molecule of this electron carrier is worth a maximum of only about two molecules of ATP.

Fig 9-16. Review: how each molecule of glucose yields many ATP molecules during cellular respiration. The text explains why the yield of 38 ATP per glucose is only an estimate of the maximum output.

In some eukaryotic cells, this lower ATP yield per electron pair also applies to the NADH produced by glycolysis in the cytosol. The mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH, so NADH in the cytosol is segregated from the machinery of oxidative phosphorylation. The two electrons of NADH captured in glycolysis must be conveyed into the mitochondrion by one of several electron shuttle systems. Depending on which shuttle is operating, the electrons are passed either to NAD+ or to FAD. If the electrons are passed to FAD, only about 2 ATP can result from each cytosolic NADH2. If passed to mitochondrial NAD+, the yield is closer to 3 ATP.

Assuming that the more energy-efficient type of shuttle is active, we can add a maximum of 34 ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation to the net of 4 ATP from substrate-level phosphorylation to give a bottom line of 38 ATP. This is only an estimate of the maximum ATP yield from a glucose molecule and is probably somewhat high. One variable that reduces ATP yield is the use of the proton-motive force generated by the redox reactions of respiration to drive other kinds of work. For example, the proton-motive force powers the mitochondrion's uptake of pyruvate from the cytosol.

We can now make a rough estimate of the efficiency of respiration--that is, the percentage of chemical energy stored in glucose that has been restocked in ATP. Recall that the complete oxidation of a mole of glucose releases 686 kcal of energy (DG = -686 kcal/mol). Phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP stores at least 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP (p. 94 explains why this number is probably higher under cellular conditions). Therefore, the efficiency of respiration is 7.3 times 38 (maximum ATP yield per glucose) divided by 686, or about 40% . The rest of the stored energy is lost as heat. We use some of this heat to maintain our relatively high body temperature (37&#176;C), and we dissipate the rest through sweating and other cooling mechanisms. Cellular respiration is remarkably efficient in its energy conversion. By comparison, the most efficient automobile converts only about 25%  of the energy stored in gasoline to move the car.





 Fermentation enables some cells to produce ATP without the help of oxygen

How can food be oxidized without oxygen? Remember, oxidation refers to the loss of electrons to any electron acceptor, not just to oxygen. Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two molecules of pyruvate. The oxidizing agent of glycolysis is NAD+, not oxygen. Overall, glycolysis is exergonic, and some of the energy made available is used to produce two ATPs (net) by substrate-level phosphorylation. If oxygen is present, then additional ATP is made by oxidative phosphorylation when NADH passes electrons removed from glucose to the electron transport chain. But glycolysis generates two ATPs whether oxygen is present or not--that is, whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic (from the Greek aer, air, and bios, life; the prefix an- means "without").

Anaerobic catabolism of organic nutrients can occur by fermentation, as mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. Fermentation is an extension of glycolysis that can generate ATP solely by substrate-level phosphorylation--as long as there is a sufficient supply of NAD+ to accept electrons during the oxidation step of glycolysis. Without some mechanism to recycle NAD+ from NADH, glycolysis would soon deplete the cell's pool of NAD+ and shut itself down for lack of an oxidizing agent. Under aerobic conditions, NAD+ is recycled productively from NADH by the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain. The anaerobic alternative is to transfer electrons from NADH to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis.

Fermentation consists of glycolysis plus reactions that regenerate NAD+ by transferring electrons from NADH to pyruvate or derivatives of pyruvate. The NAD+ can then be reused to oxidize sugar by glycolysis, which nets two molecules of ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. There are many types of fermentation, differing in the waste products formed from pyruvate. Two common types are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.

In alcohol fermentation (FIGURE 9.17a), pyruvate is converted to ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in two steps. The first step releases carbon dioxide from the pyruvate, which is converted to the two-carbon compound acetaldehyde. In the second step, acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to ethanol. This regenerates the supply of NAD+ needed for glycolysis. Alcohol fermentation by yeast, a fungus, is used in brewing and winemaking. Many bacteria also carry out alcohol fermentation under anaerobic conditions.

Fig 9-17. Fermentation. In the absence of oxygen, many cells use fermentation to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, serves as an electron acceptor for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which can then be reused in glycolysis. Two of the common waste products formed from fermen-tation are (a) ethanol and (b) lactate, the ionized form of lactic acid.

During lactic acid fermentation (FIGURE 9.17b), pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH to form lactate as a waste product, with no release of CO2. (Lactate is the ionized form of lactic acid.) Lactic acid fermentation by certain fungi and bacteria is used in the dairy industry to make cheese and yogurt. Acetone and methanol (methyl alcohol) are among the by-products of other types of microbial fermentation that are commercially important.

Human muscle cells make ATP by lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is scarce. This occurs during the early stages of strenuous exercise, when sugar catabolism for ATP production outpaces the muscle's supply of oxygen from the blood. Under these conditions, the cells switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation. The lactate that accumulates as a waste product may cause muscle fatigue and pain, but the lactate is gradually carried away by the blood to the liver. Lactate is converted back to pyruvate by liver cells.

Fermentation and Respiration Compared

Fermentation and cellular respiration are anaerobic and aerobic alternatives, respectively, for producing ATP by harvesting the chemical energy of food. Both pathways use glycolysis to oxidize glucose and other organic fuels to pyruvate, with a net production of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. And in both fermentation and respiration, NAD+ is the oxidizing agent that accepts electrons from food during glycolysis. A key difference is the contrasting mechanisms for oxidizing NADH back to NAD+, which is required to sustain glycolysis. In fermentation, the final electron acceptor is an organic molecule such as pyruvate (lactic acid fermentation) or acetaldehyde (alcohol fermentation). In respiration, by contrast, the final acceptor for electrons from NADH is oxygen. This not only regenerates the NAD+ required for glycolysis but pays an ATP bonus when the stepwise electron transport from NADH to oxygen drives oxidative phosphorylation. An even bigger ATP payoff comes from the oxidation of pyruvate in the Krebs cycle, which is unique to respiration. Without oxygen, the energy still stored in pyruvate is unavailable to the cell. Thus, cellular respiration harvests much more energy from each sugar molecule than fermentation can. In fact, respiration yields as much as 19 times more ATP per glucose molecule than does fermentation--38 ATP for respiration, compared to 2 ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in fermentation.

Some organisms, including yeasts and many bacteria, can make enough ATP to survive using either fermentation or respiration. Such species are called facultative anaerobes. On the cellular level, our muscle cells behave as facultative anaerobes. In a facultative anaerobe, pyruvate is a fork in the metabolic road that leads to two alternative catabolic routes (FIGURE 9.18). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA, and oxidation continues in the Krebs cycle. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is diverted from the Krebs cycle, serving instead as an electron acceptor to recycle NAD+. To make the same amount of ATP, a facultative anaerobe would have to consume sugar at a much faster rate when fermenting than when respiring.

Fig 9-18. Pyruvate as a key juncture in catabolism. Glycolysis is common to fermentation and respiration. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, represents a fork in the catabolic pathways of glucose oxidation. In a cell capable of both respiration and fermentation, pyruvate is committed to one of those two pathways, usually depending on whether or not oxygen is present.

The Evolutionary Significance of Glycolysis

The role of glycolysis in both fermentation and respiration has an evolutionary basis. Ancient prokaryotes probably used glycolysis to make ATP long before oxygen was present in Earth's atmosphere. The oldest known fossils of bacteria date back over 3.5 billion years, but appreciable quantities of oxygen probably did not begin to accumulate in the atmosphere until about 2.7 billion years ago. (According to fossil evidence, the cyanobacteria that produce O2 as a by-product of photosynthesis had evolved by then.) Therefore, the first prokaryotes may have generated ATP exclusively from glycolysis, which does not require oxygen. In addition, glycolysis is the most widespread metabolic pathway, which suggests that it evolved very early in the history of life. The cytosolic location of glycolysis also implies great antiquity; the pathway does not require any of the membrane-enclosed organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which evolved nearly 2 billion years after the prokaryotic cell. Glycolysis is a metabolic heirloom from the earliest cells that continues to function in fermentation and as the first stage in the breakdown of organic molecules by respiration.





 Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle connect to many other metabolic pathways

So far, we have treated the oxidative breakdown of glucose in isolation from the cell's overall metabolic economy. In this section, you will learn that glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are major intersections of various catabolic and anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways.

The Versatility of Catabolism

Throughout this chapter, we have used glucose as the fuel for cellular respiration. But free glucose molecules are not common in the diets of humans and other animals. We obtain most of our calories in the form of fats, proteins, sucrose and other disaccharides, and starch, a polysaccharide. All these food molecules can be used by cellular respiration to make ATP (FIGURE 9.19).

Fig 9-19. The catabolism of various food molecules. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used as fuel for cellular respiration. Monomers of these food molecules enter glycolysis or the Krebs cycle at various points. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are catabolic funnels through which electrons from all kinds of food molecules flow on their exergonic fall to oxygen.

Glycolysis can accept a wide range of carbohydrates for catabolism. In the digestive tract, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which can then be broken down in the cells by glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Similarly, glycogen, the polysaccharide that humans and many other animals store in their liver and muscle cells, can be hydrolyzed to glucose between meals as fuel for respiration. The digestion of disaccharides, including sucrose, provides glucose and other monosaccharides as fuel for respiration.

Proteins can also be used for fuel, but first they must be digested to their constituent amino acids. Many of the amino acids, of course, are used by the organism to build new proteins. Amino acids present in excess are converted by enzymes to intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Before amino acids can feed into glycolysis or the Krebs cycle, their amino groups must be removed, a process called deamination. The nitrogenous refuse is excreted from the animal in the form of ammonia, urea, or other waste products.

Catabolism can also harvest energy stored in fats obtained either from food or from storage cells in the body. After fats are digested, the glycerol is converted to glyceraldehyde phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis. Most of the energy of a fat is stored in the fatty acids. A metabolic sequence called beta oxidation breaks the fatty acids down to two-carbon fragments, which enter the Krebs cycle as acetyl CoA. Fats make excellent fuel. A gram of fat oxidized by respiration produces more than twice as much ATP as a gram of carbohydrate. Unfortunately, this also means that a dieter must be patient while using fat stored in the body, because so many calories are stockpiled in each gram of fat.

Biosynthesis (Anabolic Pathways)

Cells need substance as well as energy. Not all the organic molecules of food are destined to be oxidized as fuel to make ATP. In addition to calories, food must also provide the carbon skeletons that cells require to make their own molecules. Some organic monomers obtained from digestion can be used directly. For example, as previously mentioned, amino acids from the hydrolysis of proteins in food can be incorporated into the organism's own proteins. Often, however, the body needs specific molecules that are not present as such in food. Compounds formed as intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle can be diverted into anabolic pathways as precursors from which the cell can synthesize the molecules it requires. For example, humans can make about half of the 20 amino acids in proteins by modifying compounds siphoned away from the Krebs cycle. Also, glucose can be made from pyruvate, and fatty acids can be synthesized from acetyl CoA. Of course, these anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways do not generate ATP, but instead consume it.

In addition, glycolysis and the Krebs cycle function as metabolic interchanges that enable our cells to convert some kinds of molecules to others as we need them. For instance, carbohydrates and proteins can be converted to fats through intermediates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. If we eat more food than we need, we store fat even if our diet is fat-free. Metabolism is remarkably versatile and adaptable.





 Feedback mechanisms control cellular respiration

Basic principles of supply and demand regulate the metabolic economy. The cell does not waste energy making more of a particular substance than it needs. If there is a glut of a certain amino acid, for example, the anabolic pathway that synthesizes that amino acid from an intermediate of the Krebs cycle is switched off. The most common mechanism for this control is feedback inhibition: The end product of the anabolic pathway inhibits the enzyme that catalyzes an early step of the pathway (see FIGURE 6.18). This prevents the needless diversion of key metabolic intermediates from uses that are more urgent.

The cell also controls its catabolism. If the cell is working hard and its ATP concentration begins to drop, respiration speeds up. When there is plenty of ATP to meet demand, respiration slows down, sparing valuable organic molecules for other functions. Again, control is based mainly on regulating the activity of enzymes at strategic points in the catabolic pathway. One important switch is phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis (see FIGURE 9.9). That is the earliest step that commits substrate irreversibly to the glycolytic pathway. By controlling the rate of this step, the cell can speed up or slow down the entire catabolic process; phosphofructokinase is thus the pacemaker of respiration (FIGURE 9.20).

Fig 9-20. The control of cellular respiration. Allosteric enzymes at certain points in the respiratory pathway respond to inhibitors and activators that help set the pace of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Phosphofructokinase, the enzyme that catalyzes step 3 of glycolysis, is one such enzyme. It is stimulated by AMP (derived from ADP), but it is inhibited by ATP and by citrate. This feedback regulation adjusts the rate of respiration as the cell's catabolic and anabolic demands change.

An allosteric enzyme with receptor sites for specific inhibitors and activators, phosphofructokinase is inhibited by ATP and stimulated by AMP, which the cell derives from ADP (see p. 101). As ATP accumulates, inhibition of the enzyme slows down glycolysis. The enzyme becomes active again as cellular work converts ATP to ADP (and AMP) faster than ATP is being regenerated. Phosphofructokinase is also sensitive to citrate, the first product of the Krebs cycle. If citrate accumulates in mitochondria, some of it passes into the cytosol and inhibits phosphofructokinase. This mechanism helps synchronize the rates of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. As citrate accumulates, glycolysis slows down, and the supply of acetate to the Krebs cycle decreases. If citrate consumption increases, either because of a demand for more ATP or because anabolic pathways are draining off intermediates of the Krebs cycle, glycolysis accelerates and meets the demand. Metabolic balance is augmented by the control of other enzymes at other key locations in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Cells are thrifty, expedient, and responsive in their metabolism.

Examine FIGURE 9.1 again to put cellular respiration into the broader context of energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems. The energy that keeps us alive is released, but not produced, by cellular respiration. We are tapping energy that was stored in food by photosynthesis. In the next chapter, you will learn how photosynthesis captures light and converts it to chemical energy.

 Photosynthesis is the biosphere's metabolic foundation: a review







 Plants and other autotrophs are the producers of the biosphere

Photosynthesis nourishes almost all of the living world directly or indirectly. An organism acquires the organic compounds it uses for energy and carbon skeletons by one of two major modes: autotrophic or heterotrophic nutrition. At first, the term autotrophic (from the Greek autos, self, and trophos, feed) may seem to contradict the principle that organisms are open systems, taking in resources from their environment. Autotrophs are not totally self-sufficient, however; they are self-feeders only in the sense that they sustain themselves without eating other organisms or substances derived from other organisms. Autotrophs produce their organic molecules from CO2 and other inorganic raw materials obtained from the environment and are the ultimate sources of organic compounds for all nonautotrophic organisms. For this reason, biologists refer to autotrophs as the producers of the biosphere (the global ecosystem).

Plants are autotrophs; the only nutrients they require are carbon dioxide from the air, and water and minerals from the soil. Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, organisms that use light as a source of energy to synthesize organic substances. Photosynthesis also occurs in algae, including certain protists, and in some prokaryotes (FIGURE 10.1). In this chapter, our emphasis will be on plants. Variations in photosynthesis that occur in algae and bacteria will be discussed in Unit Five. A much rarer form of self-feeding is unique to those bacteria that are chemoautotrophs. These organisms produce their organic compounds without the help of light, obtaining their energy by oxidizing inorganic substances, such as sulfur or ammonia. (We will postpone further discussion of this type of autotrophic nutrition until Chapter 27.)

Fig 10-1. Photoautotrophs. These organisms use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic molecules from carbon dioxide and (in most cases) water. They feed not only themselves, but the entire living world. (a) On land, plants are the predominant producers of food. Three major groups of land plants--mosses, ferns, and flowering plants--are represented in this scene. In oceans, ponds, lakes, and other aquatic environments, photosynthetic organisms include (b) multicellular algae, such as this kelp; (c) some unicellular protists, such as Euglena;(d) the prokaryotes called cyanobacteria; and (e) other photosynthetic prokaryotes, such as these purple sulfur bacteria (c, d, e: LMs).

Heterotrophs obtain their organic material by the second major mode of nutrition. Unable to make their own food, they live on compounds produced by other organisms; heterotrophs are the biosphere's consumers. The most obvious form of this "other-feeding" (hetero means "other, different") occurs when an animal eats plants or other animals. But heterotrophic nutrition may be more subtle. Some heterotrophs consume the remains of dead organisms, decomposing and feeding on organic litter such as carcasses, feces, and fallen leaves; they are known as decomposers. Most fungi and many types of bacteria get their nourishment this way. Almost all heterotrophs, including humans, are completely dependent on photoautotrophs for food, and also for oxygen, a by-product of photosynthesis. Thus, we can trace the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe to the chloroplast.





 Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants

All green parts of a plant, including green stems and unripened fruit, have chloroplasts, but the leaves are the major sites of photosynthesis in most plants (FIGURE 10.2). There are about half a million chloroplasts per square millimeter of leaf surface. The color of the leaf is from chlorophyll, the green pigment located within the chloroplasts. It is the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll that drives the synthesis of food molecules in the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are found mainly in the cells of the mesophyll, the tissue in the interior of the leaf. Carbon dioxide enters the leaf, and oxygen exits, by way of microscopic pores called stomata (singular, stoma; from the Greek, meaning "mouth"). Water absorbed by the roots is delivered to the leaves in veins. Leaves also use veins to export sugar to roots and other nonphotosynthetic parts of the plant.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 10-2. Focusing in on the location of photosynthesis in a plant. Leaves are the major organs of photosynthesis in plants. These pictures take you into a leaf, then into a cell, and finally into a chloroplast, the organelle where photosynthesis occurs. Gas exchange between the leaf's mesophyll tissue and the atmosphere occurs through microscopic pores called stomata. Chloroplasts, found mainly in the mesophyll, are bounded by two membranes that enclose the stroma, a dense fluid. Membranes of the thylakoid system separate the stroma from the thylakoid space. Thylakoids are concentrated in stacks called grana. (Middle right, LM; bottom right, TEM.)

A typical mesophyll cell has about 30 to 40 chloroplasts, each a watermelon-shaped organelle measuring about 2-4 mm by 4-7 mm. An envelope of two membranes encloses the stroma, the dense fluid within the chloroplast. An elaborate system of interconnected thylakoid membranes segregates the stroma from another compartment, the thylakoid space (or lumen). In some places, thylakoid sacs are stacked in columns called grana. Chlorophyll resides in the thylakoid membranes. (Photosynthetic prokaryotes lack chloroplasts; but as you will see in Chapter 27, they do have membranes that function in a manner similar to the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.) Now that we have looked at the sites of photosynthesis in plants, we are ready to see how these organelles convert the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll to chemical energy.





 Evidence that chloroplasts split water molecules enabled researchers to track atoms through photosynthesis

Scientists have tried for centuries to piece together the process by which plants make food. Although some of the steps are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 1800s: In the presence of light, the green parts of plants produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Using molecular formulas, we can summarize photosynthesis with this chemical equation: 
The carbohydrate C6H12O6 is glucose.* Water appears on both sides of the equation because 12 molecules are consumed and 6 molecules are newly formed during photosynthesis. We can simplify the equation by indicating only the net consumption of water: 
Writing the equation in this form, we can see that the overall chemical change during photosynthesis is the reverse of the one that occurs during cellular respiration. Both of these metabolic processes occur in plant cells. However, as you will soon learn, plants do not make food by simply reversing the steps of respiration.

Now let's divide the photosynthetic equation by 6 to put it in its simplest possible form: 
Here, CH2O is not an actual sugar but represents the general formula for a carbohydrate. In other words, we are imagining the synthesis of a sugar molecule one carbon at a time. Six repetitions would produce a glucose molecule. Let's now use this simplified formula to see how researchers tracked the chemical elements (C, H, and O) from the reactants of photosynthesis to the products.

The Splitting of Water

One of the first clues to the mechanism of photosynthesis came from the discovery that the oxygen given off by plants is derived from water and not from carbon dioxide. The chloroplast splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Before this discovery, the prevailing hypothesis was that photosynthesis split carbon dioxide and then added water to the carbon. 
This hypothesis predicted that the O2 released during photosynthesis came from CO2. This idea was challenged in the 1930s by C. B. van Niel of Stanford University. Van Niel was investigating photosynthesis in bacteria that make their carbohydrate from CO2 but do not release O2. Van Niel concluded that, at least in these bacteria, CO2 is not split into carbon and oxygen. One group of bacteria used hydrogen sulfide (H2S) rather than water for photosynthesis, forming yellow globules of sulfur as a waste product (these globules are visible in FIGURE 10.1e). Here is the chemical equation: 
Van Niel reasoned that the bacteria split H2S and used the hydrogen to make sugar. He then generalized that idea, proposing that all photosynthetic organisms require a hydrogen source, but that the source varies: 
Thus, van Niel hypothesized that plants split water as a source of hydrogen, releasing oxygen as a by-product.

Nearly 20 years later, scientists confirmed van Niel's hypothesis by using oxygen-18 (18O), a heavy isotope, as a tracer to follow the fate of oxygen atoms during photosynthesis. The O2 that came from plants was labeled with 18O only if water was the source of the tracer. If the 18O was introduced to the plant in the form of CO2, the label did not turn up in the released O2. In the following summary of these experiments, red denotes labeled atoms of oxygen: 
The most important result of the shuffling of atoms during photosynthesis is the extraction of hydrogen from water and its incorporation into sugar. The waste product of photosynthesis, O2, restores the atmospheric oxygen consumed during cellular respiration. FIGURE 10.3 shows the fates of all atoms in photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis as a Redox Process

Let's briefly contrast photosynthesis with cellular respiration. During respiration, energy is released from sugar when electrons associated with hydrogen are transported by carriers to oxygen, forming water as a by-product. The electrons lose potential energy as they are pulled down the electron transport chain to electronegative oxygen, and the mitochondrion uses the energy to synthesize ATP. Photosynthesis, also a redox process, reverses the direction of electron flow. Water is split, and electrons are transferred along with hydrogen ions from the water to carbon dioxide, reducing it to sugar. The electrons increase in potential energy as they move from water to sugar. The required energy boost is provided by light.





 The light reactions and the Calvin cycle cooperate in converting light energy to the chemical energy of food: an overview

The equation for photosynthesis is a deceptively simple summary of a very complex process. Actually, photosynthesis is not a single process, but two processes, each with multiple steps. These two stages of photosynthesis are known as the light reactions (the photo part of photosynthesis) and the Calvin cycle (the synthesis part) (FIGURE 10.4).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 10-4. An overview of photosynthesis: cooperation of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the chloroplast, the thylakoid membranes are the sites of the light reactions, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. The light reactions use solar energy to make ATP and NADPH, which function as chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, in the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle incorporates CO2 into organic molecules, which are converted to sugar. (Recall from Chapter 5 that most simple sugars have formulas that are some multiple of CH2O.)

The light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of electrons and hydrogen from water to an acceptor called NADP+1 (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which temporarily stores the energized electrons. Water is split in the process, and thus it is the light reactions of photosynthesis that give off O2 as a by-product. The electron acceptor of the light reactions, NADP+, is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with a hydrogen nucleus, or H+. The light reactions also generate ATP by powering the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of energized electrons ("reducing power"), and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle.

The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired energized electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions regenerate the NADPH and ATP spent in the reduction of CO2 to sugar. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.

As FIGURE 10.4 indicates, the thylakoids of the chloroplast are the sites of the light reactions, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. As molecules of NADP+ and ADP bump into the thylakoid membrane, they pick up electrons and phosphate, respectively, and then transfer their high-energy cargo to the Calvin cycle. The two stages of photosynthesis are treated in this figure as metabolic modules that take in ingredients and crank out products. Our next step toward understanding photosynthesis is to look more closely at how the two stages work, beginning with the light reactions.





 The light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH: a closer look

Chloroplasts are chemical factories powered by the sun. Their thylakoids transform light energy into the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH. To understand this conversion better, it is necessary to know about some important properties of light.

The Nature of Sunlight

Light is a form of energy known as electromagnetic energy, also called electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic energy travels in rhythmic waves analogous to those created by dropping a pebble into a puddle of water. Electromagnetic waves, however, are disturbances of electrical and magnetic fields rather than disturbances of a material medium such as water.

The distance between the crests of electromagnetic waves is called the wavelength. Wavelengths range from less than a nanometer (for gamma rays) to more than a kilometer (for radio waves). This entire range of radiation is known as the electromagnetic spectrum (FIGURE 10.5). The segment most important to life is the narrow band that ranges from about 380 to 750 nm in wavelength. This radiation is known as visible light, because it is detected as various colors by the human eye.

Fig 10-5. The electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic energy radiate through space as waves of various lengths. We perceive different wavelengths of visible light, which range from about 380 to 750 nm, as different colors. White light is a mixture of all wavelengths of visible light. A prism can sort white light into its component colors by bending light of different wavelengths at different angles. Visible light drives photosynthesis.

The model of light as waves explains many of light's properties, but in certain respects light behaves as though it consists of discrete particles, called photons. Photons are not tangible objects, but they act like objects in that each of them has a fixed quantity of energy. The amount of energy is inversely related to the wavelength of the light; the shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy of each photon of that light. Thus, a photon of violet light packs nearly twice as much energy as a photon of red light.

Although the sun radiates the full spectrum of electro magnetic energy, the atmosphere acts like a selective window, allowing visible light to pass through while screening out a substantial fraction of other radiation. The part of the spectrum we can see--visible light--is also the radiation that drives photosynthesis.

Photosynthetic Pigments: The Light Receptors

As light meets matter, it may be reflected, transmitted, or absorbed. Substances that absorb visible light are called pigments. Different pigments absorb light of different wavelengths, and the wavelengths that are absorbed disappear. If a pigment is illuminated with white light, the color we see is the color most reflected or transmitted by the pigment. (If a pigment absorbs all wavelengths, it appears black.) We see green when we look at a leaf because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light while transmitting and reflecting green light (FIGURE 10.6). The ability of a pigment to absorb various wavelengths of light can be measured with an instrument called a spectrophotometer. This machine directs beams of light of different wavelengths through a solution of the pigment and measures the fraction of the light transmitted at each wavelength (FIGURE 10.7). A graph plotting a pigment's light absorption (the fraction not transmitted or reflected) versus wavelength is called an absorption spectrum.

Fig 10-6. Why leaves are green: interaction of light with chloroplasts. The pigment molecules of chloroplasts absorb blue and red light and reflect or transmit green light. This is why leaves appear green. It turns out that blue and red are the colors of light most effective in photosynthesis.

Fig 10-7. Determining an absorption spectrum. A spectrophotometer measures the relative amounts of light of different wavelengths absorbed and transmitted by a pigment solution. Inside the spectrophotometer, white light is separated into colors (wavelengths) by a prism. Then, one by one, the different colors of light are passed through the sample. The transmitted light strikes a photoelectric tube, which converts the light energy to electricity, and the electrical current is measured by a galvanometer. Each time the wavelength of light is changed, the meter indicates the fraction of light transmitted through the sample (or, conversely, the fraction of light absorbed). This figure shows the transmittance reading on the meter when (a) green light and then (b) blue light are passed through a chlorophyll solution.

The absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide clues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths for driving photosynthesis, since light can perform work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed. FIGURE 10.8 a shows the absorption spectra of a type of chlorophyll called chlorophyll a and some other pigments in the chloroplast. If we look first at the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a, it suggests that blue and red light work best for photosynthesis, while green is the least effective color. This is confirmed by an action spectrum for photosynthesis (FIGURE 10.8b), which profiles the relative performance of the different wavelengths. An action spectrum is prepared by illuminating chloroplasts with different colors of light and then plotting wavelength against some measure of photosynthetic rate, such as carbon dioxide consumption or oxygen release. The action spectrum for photosynthesis was first demonstrated in 1883 in an elegant experiment performed by the German botanist Thomas Engelmann, who used bacteria to measure rates of photosynthesis in filamentous algae (FIGURE 10.8c).

Fig 10-8. Evidence that chloroplast pigments participate in photosynthesis: absorption and action spectra for photosynthesis in an alga.

Notice by comparing FIGURES 10.8a and 10.8b that the action spectrum for photosynthesis does not exactly match the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a. The absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a alone underestimates the effectiveness of certain wavelengths in driving photosynthesis. This is partly because chlorophyll a is not the only photosynthetically important pigment in chloroplasts. Only chlorophyll a can participate directly in the light reactions, which convert solar energy to chemical energy. But other pigments in the thylakoid membrane can absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a, which then initiates the light reactions. One of these accessory pigments is another form of chlorophyll, chlorophyll b. Chlorophyll b is almost identical to chlorophyll a (see FIGURE 10.9 on page 184), but a slight structural difference between them is enough to give the two pigments slightly different absorption spectra and hence different colors. Chlorophyll a is blue-green, whereas chlorophyll b is yellow-green. If a photon of sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll b, energy is conveyed to chlorophyll a, which then behaves just as though it had absorbed the photon. Other accessory pigments include carotenoids, hydrocarbons that are various shades of yellow and orange (see FIGURE 10.8a). Carotenoids may broaden the spectrum of colors that can drive photosynthesis. However, a more important function of at least some carotenoids seems to be photoprotection: Rather than transmit energy to chlorophyll, these compounds absorb and dissipate excessive light energy that would otherwise damage chlorophyll. (Interestingly, carotenoids similar to the photoprotective ones in chloroplasts have a photoprotective role in the human eye.)

Fig 10-9. Location and structure of chlorophyll molecules in plants. A plant's chlorophyll molecules, along with accessory pigment molecules, are immersed in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, in association with protein (purple). Chlorophyll a, the pigment that participates directly in the light reactions of photosynthesis, has a "head," called a porphyrin ring, with a magnesium atom at its center. Attached to the porphyrin is a hydrocarbon tail, which interacts with hydrophobic regions of proteins inside the thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll b differs from chlorophyll a only in one of the functional groups bonded to the porphyrin.

Excitation of Chlorophyll by Light

What exactly happens when chlorophyll and other pigments absorb photons? The colors corresponding to the absorbed wavelengths disappear from the spectrum of the transmitted and reflected light, but energy cannot disappear. When a molecule absorbs a photon, one of the molecule's electrons is elevated to an orbital where it has more potential energy. When the electron is in its normal orbital, the pigment molecule is said to be in its ground state. After absorption of a photon boosts an electron to an orbital of higher energy, the pigment molecule is said to be in an excited state. The only photons absorbed are those whose energy is exactly equal to the energy difference between the ground state and an excited state, and this energy difference varies from one kind of atom or molecule to another. Thus, a particular compound absorbs only photons corresponding to specific wavelengths, which is why each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum.

Photons are absorbed by clusters of pigment molecules embedded in the thylakoid membrane (FIGURE 10.9). The energy of an absorbed photon is converted to the potential energy of an electron raised from the ground state to an excited state. But the electron cannot remain there long; the excited state, like all high-energy states, is unstable. Generally, when pigments absorb light, their excited electrons drop back down to the ground-state orbital in a billionth of a second, releasing their excess energy as heat. This conversion of light energy to heat is what makes the top of an automobile so hot on a sunny day. (White cars are coolest because their paint reflects all wavelengths of visible light, although it may absorb ultraviolet and other invisible radiation.) Some pigments, including chlorophyll, emit light as well as heat after absorbing photons. The electron jumps to a state of greater energy, and as it falls back to ground state, a photon is given off. This afterglow is called fluorescence. If a solution of chlorophyll isolated from chloroplasts is illuminated, it will fluoresce in the red part of the spectrum and also give off heat (FIGURE 10.10).

Fig 10-10. Excitation of isolated chlorophyll by light. (a) Absorption of a photon causes a transition of the chlorophyll molecule from its ground state to its excited state. The photon boosts an electron to an orbital where it has more potential energy. If the illuminated molecule exists in isolation, its excited electron immediately drops back down to the ground-state orbital, and its excess energy is given off as heat and fluorescence (light). (b) A chlorophyll solution excited with ultraviolet light will fluoresce with a red-orange glow.

Photosystems: Light-Harvesting Complexes of the Thylakoid Membrane

Chlorophyll excited by absorption of light energy produces very different results in an intact chloroplast than it does in isolation. In its native environment of the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll is organized along with proteins and other kinds of smaller organic molecules into photosystems.

A photosystem has a light-gathering "antenna complex" consisting of a cluster of a few hundred chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid molecules (FIGURE 10.11). The number and variety of pigment molecules enable a photosystem to harvest light over a larger surface and a larger portion of the spectrum than any single pigment molecule could harvest. When any antenna molecule absorbs a photon, the energy is transmitted from pigment molecule to pigment molecule until it reaches a particular chlorophyll a. What is special about this chlorophyll a molecule is not its molecular structure, but its position. Only this chlorophyll molecule is located in the region of the photosystem called the reaction center, where the first light-driven chemical reaction of photosynthesis occurs.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 10-11. How a photosystem harvests light. Photosystems are the light-harvesting units of the thylakoid membrane. Each photosystem is a complex of proteins and other kinds of molecules and includes an antenna consisting of a few hundred pigment molecules. When a photon strikes a pigment molecule, the energy is passed from molecule to molecule until it reaches the reaction center. At the reaction center, an excited electron from the reaction-center chlorophyll is captured by a specialized molecule called the primary electron acceptor.

Sharing the reaction center with the chlorophyll a molecule is a specialized molecule called the primary electron acceptor. In an oxidation-reduction reaction, the chlorophyll a molecule at the reaction center loses one of its electrons to the primary electron acceptor. This redox reaction occurs when light excites the electron to a higher energy level in chlorophyll and the electron acceptor traps the high-energy electron before it can return to the ground state in the chlorophyll molecule. Isolated chlorophyll fluoresces because there is no electron acceptor to prevent electrons of photoexcited chlorophyll from dropping right back to the ground state. In a chloroplast, the acceptor molecule functions like a dam that prevents this immediate plunge of high-energy electrons back to the ground state. Thus, each photosystem--reaction-center chlorophyll and primary electron acceptor surrounded by an antenna complex--functions in the chloroplast as a light-harvesting unit. The solar-powered transfer of electrons from chlorophyll to the primary electron acceptor is the first step of the light reactions.

The thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are called photosystem I and photosystem II, in order of their discovery. Each has a characteristic reaction center--a particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a chlorophyll a molecule associated with specific proteins. The reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I is known as P700 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 700 nm (the far-red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll at the reaction center of photosystem II is called P680 because its absorption spectrum has a peak at 680 nm (also in the red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P700 and P680, are actually identical chlorophyll a molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane affects the electron distribution in the chlorophyll molecules and accounts for the slight differences in light-absorbing properties. Now let's see how the two photosystems work together in using light energy to generate ATP and NADPH, the two main products of the light reactions.

Noncyclic Electron Flow

Light drives the synthesis of NADPH and ATP by energizing the two photosystems embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The key to this energy transformation is a flow of electrons through the photosystems and other molecular components built into the thylakoid membrane. During the light reactions of photosynthesis, there are two possible routes for electron flow: cyclic and noncyclic. Noncyclic electron flow, the predominant route, is shown in FIGURE 10.12 on p. 186 The numbers in the text description correspond to the numbered steps in the figure.

Fig 10-12. How noncyclic electron flow during the light reactions generates ATP and NADPH. The gold arrows trace the current of light-driven electrons from water to NADPH. Each photon of light excites a single electron, but the diagram tracks two electrons at a time, the number of electrons required to reduce NADP+. The numbered steps are described in the text.

The energy changes of electrons as they flow through the light reactions are analogous to the cartoon in FIGURE 10.13. As complicated as the scheme is, do not lose track of its functions: The light reactions use solar power to generate ATP and NADPH, which provide chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, to the sugar-making reactions of the Calvin cycle.

Cyclic Electron Flow

Under certain conditions, photoexcited electrons take an alternative path called cyclic electron flow, which uses photosystem I but not photosystem II. You can see in FIGURE 10.14 that cyclic flow is a short circuit: The electrons cycle back from ferredoxin (Fd) to the cytochrome complex and from there continue on to the P700 chlorophyll. There is no production of NADPH and no release of oxygen. Cyclic flow does, however, generate ATP. This is called cyclic photophosphorylation, to distinguish it from noncyclic photophosphorylation.

Fig 10-14. Cyclic electron flow. Photoexcited electrons from photosystem I are occasionally shunted back from ferredoxin (Fd) to chlorophyll via the cytochrome complex and plastocyanin (Pc). This electron shunt supplements the supply of ATP but produces no NADPH. The "shadow" of noncyclic electron flow is included in the diagram for comparison with the cyclic route. The two ferredoxin molecules shown in this diagram are actually one and the same--the final electron carrier in the electron transport chain of photosystem I.

What is the function of cyclic electron flow? Noncyclic electron flow produces ATP and NADPH in roughly equal quantities, but the Calvin cycle consumes more ATP than NADPH. Cyclic electron flow makes up the difference. The concentration of NADPH in the chloroplast may help regulate which pathway, cyclic versus noncyclic, electrons take through the light reactions. If the chloroplast runs low on ATP for the Calvin cycle, NADPH will begin to accumulate as the Calvin cycle slows down. The rise in NADPH may stimulate a temporary shift from noncyclic to cyclic electron flow until ATP supply catches up with demand.

Whether photophosphorylation is driven by noncyclic or cyclic electron flow, the actual mechanism for ATP synthesis is the same. This is a good time to review chemiosmosis, the process that uses membranes to couple redox reactions to ATP production.

A Comparison of Chemiosmosis in Chloroplasts and Mitochondria

Chloroplasts and mitochondria generate ATP by the same basic mechanism: chemiosmosis. An electron transport chain assembled in a membrane pumps protons across the membrane as electrons are passed through a series of carriers that are progressively more electronegative. In this way, electron transport chains transform redox energy to a proton-motive force, potential energy stored in the form of an H+ gradient across a membrane. Built into the same membrane is an ATP synthase complex that couples the diffusion of hydrogen ions down their gradient to the phosphorylation of ADP. Some of the electron carriers, including the iron-containing proteins called cytochromes, are very similar in chloroplasts and mitochondria. The ATP synthase complexes of the two organelles are also very much alike. But there are noteworthy differences between oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and photophosphorylation in chloroplasts. In mitochondria, the high-energy electrons dropped down the transport chain are extracted from food molecules (which are thus oxidized). Chloroplasts do not need food to make ATP; their photosystems capture light energy and use it to drive electrons to the top of the transport chain. In other words, mitochondria transfer chemical energy from food molecules to ATP, whereas chloroplasts transform light energy into chemical energy.

The spatial organization of chemiosmosis also differs in chloroplasts and mitochondria (FIGURE 10.15). The inner membrane of the mitochondrion pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix out to the intermembrane space, which then serves as a reservoir of hydrogen ions that powers the ATP synthase. The thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast pumps protons from the stroma into the thylakoid space, which functions as the H+ reservoir. The thylakoid membrane makes ATP as the hydrogen ions diffuse from the thylakoid space back to the stroma through ATP synthase complexes, whose catalytic knobs are on the stroma side of the membrane. Thus, ATP forms in the stroma, where it is used to help drive sugar synthesis during the Calvin cycle.

Fig 10-15. Comparison of chemiosmosis in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In both kinds of organelles, electron transport chains pump protons (H+) across a membrane from a region of low H+ concentration (light brown in this diagram) to one of high H+ concentration (darker brown). The protons then diffuse back across the membrane through ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP. The diagram identifies the regions of high and low H+ concentration in the two organelles.

The proton gradient, or pH gradient, across the thylakoid membrane is substantial. When chloroplasts are illuminated, the pH in the thylakoid space drops to about 5, and the pH in the stroma increases to about 8. This gradient of three pH units corresponds to a thousandfold difference in H+ concentration. If in the laboratory the lights are turned off, the pH gradient is abolished, but it can quickly be restored by turning the lights back on. Such experiments add to the evidence described in Chapter 9 in support of the chemiosmotic model.

Based on studies in several laboratories, FIGURE 10.16 shows a current model for the organization of the light-reaction "machinery" within the thylakoid membrane. Each of the molecules and molecular complexes in the figure is present in numerous copies in each thylakoid. Notice that NADPH, like ATP, is produced on the side of the membrane facing the stroma, where the Calvin cycle reactions take place.

Fig 10-16. The light reactions and chemiosmosis: the organization of the thylakoid membrane. This diagram shows a current model for the organization of the thylakoid membrane. The gold arrows track the noncyclic electron flow outlined in FIGURE 10.12. As electrons pass from carrier to carrier in redox reactions, hydrogen ions removed from the stroma are deposited in the thylakoid space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient). At least three steps in the light reactions contribute to the proton gradient: 
			  
		 Water is split by photosystem II on the side of the membrane facing the thylakoid space; 
			  
		 as plastoquinone (Pq), a mobile carrier, transfers electrons to the cytochrome complex, protons are translocated across the membrane; and 
			  
		 a hydrogen ion is removed from the stroma when it is taken up by NADP+. The diffusion of H+ from the thylakoid space to the stroma (along the H+ concentration gradient) powers the ATP synthase. These light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the sugar-producing Calvin cycle.

Let's summarize the light reactions. Noncyclic electron flow pushes electrons from water, where they are at a low state of potential energy, to NADPH, where they are stored at a high state of potential energy. The light-driven electron current also generates ATP. Thus, the equipment of the thylakoid membrane converts light energy to the chemical energy stored in NADPH and ATP. (Oxygen is a by-product.) Let's now see how the Calvin cycle uses the products of the light reactions to synthesize sugar from CO2.





 The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 to sugar: a closer look

The Calvin cycle is a metabolic pathway similar to the Krebs cycle in that a starting material is regenerated after molecules enter and leave the cycle. Carbon enters the Calvin cycle in the form of CO2 and leaves in the form of sugar. The cycle spends ATP as an energy source and consumes NADPH as reducing power for adding high-energy electrons to make the sugar.

The carbohydrate produced directly from the Calvin cycle is actually not glucose, but a three-carbon sugar named glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). For the net synthesis of one molecule of this sugar, the cycle must take place three times, fixing three molecules of CO2. (Recall that carbon fixation refers to the initial incorporation of CO2 into organic material.) As we trace the steps of the cycle, keep in mind that we are following three molecules of CO2 through the reactions. FIGURE 10.17 divides the Calvin cycle into three phases :



Click image to enlarge



Fig 10-17. The Calvin cycle. This diagram tracks carbon atoms (gray balls) through the cycle. The three phases of the cycle correspond to the phases discussed in the text. For every three molecules of CO2 that enter the cycle, the net output is one molecule of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon sugar. For each G3P synthesized, the cycle spends nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH. The light reactions sustain the Calvin cycle by regenerating ATP and NADPH.

Phase 1: Carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle incorporates each CO2 molecule by attaching it to a five-carbon sugar named ribulose bisphosphate (abbreviated RuBP). The enzyme that catalyzes this first step is RuBP carboxylase, or rubisco. (It is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and probably the most abundant protein on Earth.) The product of the reaction is a six-carbon intermediate so unstable that it immediately splits in half to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (for each CO2).

Phase 2: Reduction. Each molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate receives an additional phosphate group from ATP, becoming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Next, a pair of electrons donated from NADPH reduces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to G3P. Specifically, the electrons from NADPH reduce the carboyxl group of 3-phosphoglycerate to the carbonyl group of G3P, which stores more potential energy. G3P is a sugar--the same three-carbon sugar formed in glycolysis by the splitting of glucose. Notice in FIGURE 10.17 that for every three molecules of CO2, there are six molecules of G3P. But only one molecule of this three-carbon sugar can be counted as a net gain of carbohydrate. The cycle began with 15 carbons' worth of carbohydrate in the form of three molecules of the five-carbon sugar RuBP. Now there are 18 carbons' worth of carbohydrate in the form of six molecules of G3P. One molecule exits the cycle to be used by the plant cell, but the other five molecules must be recycled to regenerate the three molecules of RuBP.

Phase 3: Regeneration of CO2 acceptor (RuBP). In a complex series of reactions, the carbon skeletons of five molecules of G3P are rearranged by the last steps of the Calvin cycle into three molecules of RuBP. To accomplish this, the cycle spends three more molecules of ATP. The RuBP is now prepared to receive CO2 again, and the cycle continues.

For the net synthesis of one G3P molecule, the Calvin cycle consumes a total of nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH. The light reactions regenerate the ATP and NADPH. The G3P spun off from the Calvin cycle becomes the starting material for metabolic pathways that synthesize other organic compounds, including glucose and other carbohydrates. Neither the light reactions nor the Calvin cycle alone can make sugar from CO2. Photosynthesis is an emergent property of the intact chloroplast, which integrates the two stages of photosynthesis.





 Alternative mechanisms of carbon fixation have evolved in hot, arid climates

Ever since plants first moved onto land about 425 million years ago, they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life, particularly the problem of dehydration. In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water. Here we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores through the leaf surface (see FIGURE 10.2). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water. This response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to CO2. With stomata even partially closed, CO2 concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf, and the concentration of O2 released from photosynthesis begins to increase. These conditions within the leaf favor a seemingly wasteful process called photorespiration.

Photorespiration: An Evolutionary Relic?

In most plants, initial fixation of carbon occurs via rubisco, the Calvin cycle enzyme that adds CO2 to ribulose bisphosphate. Such plants are called C3 plants because the first organic product of carbon fixation is a three-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (see FIGURE 10.17). Rice, wheat, and soybeans are among the C3 plants that are important in agriculture. These plants produce less food when their stomata close on hot, dry days. The declining level of CO2 in the leaf starves the Calvin cycle. Making matters worse, rubisco can accept O2 in place of CO2. As O2 concentrations overtake CO2 concentrations within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and one piece, a two-carbon compound, is exported from the chloroplast. Mitochondria and peroxisomes then break the two-carbon molecule down to CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, photorespiration generates no ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no food. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle.

How can we explain the existence of a metabolic process that seems to be counterproductive to the plant? According to one hypothesis, photorespiration is evolutionary baggage--a metabolic relic from a much earlier time, when the atmosphere had less O2 and more CO2 than it does today. In the ancient atmosphere present when rubisco first evolved, the inability of the enzyme's active site to exclude O2 would have made little difference. The hypothesis speculates that modern rubisco retains some of its ancestral affinity for O2, which is now so concentrated in the atmosphere that a certain amount of photorespiration is inevitable.

It is not known whether photorespiration is beneficial to plants in any way. It is known that in many types of plants--including some of agricultural importance, such as soybeans--photorespiration drains away as much as 50%  of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. As heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food, we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful. Indeed, if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity, crop yields and food supplies would increase.

The environmental conditions that foster photorespiration are hot, dry, bright days--the conditions that cause stomata to close. In certain plant species, alternate modes of carbon fixation that minimize photorespiration--even in hot, arid climates--have evolved. The two most important of these photosynthetic adaptations are C4 photosynthesis and CAM.

C4 Plants

The C4 plants are so named because they preface the Calvin cycle with an alternate mode of carbon fixation that forms a four-carbon compound as its first product. Several thousand species in at least 19 plant families use the C4 pathway. Among the C4 plants important to agriculture are sugarcane and corn, members of the grass family.

A unique leaf anatomy is correlated with the mechanism of C4 photosynthesis (FIGURE 10.18; compare withFIGURE 10.2). In C4 plants, there are two distinct types of photosynthetic cells: bundle-sheath cells and mesophyll cells. Bundle-sheath cells are arranged into tightly packed sheaths around the veins of the leaf. Between the bundle sheath and the leaf surface are the more loosely arranged mesophyll cells. The Calvin cycle is confined to the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath. However, the cycle is preceded by incorporation of CO2 into organic compounds in the mesophyll. The first step is the addition of CO2 to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form the four-carbon product oxaloacetate. The enzyme PEP carboxylase adds CO2 to PEP. Compared to rubisco, PEP carboxylase has a very high affinity for CO2. Therefore, PEP carboxylase can fix CO2 efficiently when rubisco cannot--that is, when it is hot and dry and stomata are partially closed, causing CO2 concentration in the leaf to fall and O2 concentration to rise. After the C4 plant fixes CO2, the mesophyll cells export their four-carbon products (malate in the example shown in FIGURE 10.18) to bundle-sheath cells through plasmodesmata (see FIGURE 7.28). Within the bundle-sheath cells, the four-carbon compounds release CO2, which is reassimilated into organic material by rubisco and the Calvin cycle.

Fig 10-18. C4 leaf anatomy and the C4 pathway. The structure and biochemical functions of the leaves of C4 plants are an evolutionary adaptation to hot, dry climates. This adaptation maintains a CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath that favors photosynthesis over photorespiration.

In effect, the mesophyll cells of a C4 plant pump CO2 into the bundle sheath, keeping the CO2 concentration in the bundle-sheath cells high enough for rubisco to accept carbon dioxide rather than oxygen. In this way, C4 photosynthesis minimizes photorespiration and enhances sugar production. This adaptation is especially advantageous in hot regions with intense sunlight, and it is in such environments that C4 plants evolved and thrive today.

CAM Plants

A second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in succulent (water-storing) plants (including ice plants), many cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids made the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.

Notice in FIGURE 10.19 that the CAM pathway is similar to the C4 pathway in that carbon dioxide is first incorporated into organic intermediates before it enters the Calvin cycle. The difference is that in C4 plants, the initial steps of carbon fixation are separated structurally from the Calvin cycle, whereas in CAM plants, the two steps occur at separate times. (Keep in mind that CAM, C4, and C3 plants all eventually use the Calvin cycle to make sugar from carbon dioxide.)

 Photosynthesis is the biosphere's metabolic foundation: a review

In this chapter, we have followed photosynthesis from photons to food. The light reactions capture solar energy and use it to make ATP and transfer electrons from water to NADP+. The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH to produce sugar from carbon dioxide. The energy that enters the chloroplasts as sunlight becomes stored as chemical energy in organic compounds. See FIGURE 10.20 on page 194 for a review of the entire process.

Fig 10-20. A review of photosynthesis. This diagram outlines the main reactants and products of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle as they occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The entire ordered operation depends on the structural integrity of the chloroplast and its membranes. Enzymes in the chloroplast and cytosol convert glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), the direct product of the Calvin cycle, into many other organic compounds.

What are the fates of photosynthetic products? The sugar made in the chloroplasts supplies the entire plant with chemical energy and carbon skeletons to synthesize all the major organic molecules of cells. About 50%  of the organic material made by photosynthesis is consumed as fuel for cellular respiration in the mitochondria of the plant cells. Sometimes there is a loss of photosynthetic products to photorespiration.

Technically, green cells are the only autotrophic parts of the plant. The rest of the plant depends on organic molecules exported from leaves via veins. In most plants, carbohydrate is transported out of the leaves in the form of sucrose, a disaccharide. After arriving at nonphotosynthetic cells, the sucrose provides raw material for cellular respiration and a multitude of anabolic pathways that synthesize proteins, lipids, and other products. A considerable amount of sugar in the form of glucose is linked together to make the polysaccharide cellulose, especially in plant cells that are still growing and maturing. Cellulose, the main ingredient of cell walls, is the most abundant organic molecule in the plant--and probably on the surface of the planet.

Most plants manage to make more organic material each day than they need to use as respiratory fuel and precursors for biosynthesis. They stockpile the extra sugar by synthesizing starch, storing some in the chloroplasts themselves and some in storage cells of roots, tubers, seeds, and fruits. In accounting for the consumption of the food molecules produced by photosynthesis, let's not forget that most plants lose leaves, roots, stems, fruits, and sometimes their entire bodies to heterotrophs, including humans.

On a global scale, the collective productivity of the minute chloroplasts is prodigious; it is estimated that photosynthesis makes about 160 billion metric tons of carbohydrate per year (a metric ton is 1,000 kg, about 1.1 tons). That's organic matter equivalent to a stack of about 60 trillion copies of this textbook--17 stacks of books reaching from Earth to the sun! No other chemical process on the planet can match the output of photosynthesis. And no process is more important than photosynthesis to the welfare of life on Earth.

Watch out! There's a car coming! We don't really need such a warning to remind us of the importance of communication in our lives. Perhaps less obvious is the critical role of communication in life at the cellular level. Cell-to-cell communication is absolutely essential for multicellular organisms. The billions of cells in a human or an oak tree must communicate in order to coordinate their activities in a way that enables the organism to develop from a fertilized egg and then survive and reproduce in turn. Communication between cells is also important for many unicellular organisms, such as the yeast pictured in the micrograph on this page.

In studying how cells signal to each other and how they interpret the signals they receive, biologists have discovered some universal mechanisms of cellular regulation, additional evidence for the evolutionary relatedness of all life. The same small set of cell-signaling mechanisms are showing up again and again in many lines of biological research. And to the delight of scientists, studies of cell signaling are helping to answer some of the most important questions in biology and medicine--in areas ranging from embryological development to hormone action to cancer and other kinds of disease.

The signals received by cells, whether originating from other cells or from changes in the physical environment, take various forms. For instance, cells can sense and respond to electromagnetic signals, such as light, and to mechanical signals, such as touch. (In later units of this text, we discuss cellular detection of these and other kinds of physical signals.) However, cells most often communicate with each other by chemical signals. In this chapter, we focus on the main mechanisms by which cells detect, process, and respond to chemical signals sent from other cells.





AN OVERVIEW OF CELL SIGNALING

 

 Cell signaling evolved early in the history of life



 

 Communicating cells may be close together or far apart



 

 The three stages of cell signaling are reception, transduction, and response



What do cells talk about? What kinds of things does a "talking" cell say to a "listening" cell, and how does the latter cell respond to the message? Let's approach these questions by first looking at communication among microorganisms, for modern microbes are a window to the role of cell signaling in the evolution of life on Earth.





SIGNAL RECEPTION AND THE INITIATION OF TRANSDUCTION

 

 A signal molecule binds to a receptor protein, causing the protein to change shape



 

 Most signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins



When we speak to someone, others nearby may hear our message, sometimes with unfortunate consequences. However, errors of this kind rarely occur among cells. The signals emitted by an a yeast cell are "heard" only by its prospective mates, a cells. Similarly, although epinephrine encounters many types of cells as it circulates in the blood, only certain target cells detect and react to the hormone. The signal receptor is the identity tag on the target cell.





SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS

 

 Pathways relay signals from receptors to cellular responses



 

 Protein phosphorylation, a common mode of regulation in cells, is a major mechanism of signal transduction



 

 Certain small molecules and ions are key components of signaling pathways (second messengers)



When signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins, like most of those we have discussed, the transduction stage of cell signaling is usually a multistep pathway. One benefit of such pathways is the possibility of greatly amplifying a signal. If some of the molecules in a pathway transmit the signal to multiple molecules of the next component in the series, the result can be a large number of activated molecules at the end of the pathway. In other words, a small number of extracellular signal molecules can produce a large cellular response. Moreover, multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation than simpler systems do, as we'll discuss later.





CELLULAR RESPONSES TO SIGNALS

 

 In response to a signal, a cell may regulate activities in the cytoplasm or transcription in the nucleus



 

 Elaborate pathways amplify and specify the cell's response to signals



We now take a closer look at the cell's eventual response to an extracellular signal--what some researchers call the "output response." What is the nature of the final step in a signaling pathway?





 Cell signaling evolved early in the history of life

One topic of cell "conversation" is sex--at least for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fungus people have used for millennia for making bread, wine, and beer. Researchers have learned that cells of this yeast identify their mates by chemical signaling (FIGURE 11.1). There are two sexes, or mating types, called a and a. Cells of mating type a secrete a chemical signal called a factor, which can bind to specific receptor proteins on nearby a cells. At the same time, a cells secrete a factor, which binds to receptors on a cells. Without actually entering the cells, the receptor-bound molecules of the two mating factors cause the cells to grow toward each other and bring about other cellular changes. The result is the fusion, or mating, of two cells of opposite type. The new a/a cell contains all the genes of both original cells, a combination of genetic resources that provides advantages to this cell's descendants.

Fig 11-1. Communication between mating yeast cells. Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae use chemical signaling to identify cells of opposite mating type and initiate the mating process. The two mating types and their corresponding chemical signals, or "mating factors," are called a and a. The mating factors are peptides about 12 amino acids in length.

How is the mating signal at the yeast cell surface transduced, or changed, into a form that brings about the cellular response of mating? The process by which a signal on a cell's surface is converted into a specific cellular response is a series of steps called a signal-transduction pathway. Many such pathways have been extensively studied in both yeast and animal cells. Amazingly, the molecular details of signal transduction in yeast and mammals are strikingly similar, even though the last common ancestor of these two groups of organisms lived over a billion years ago. These similarities--and others recently uncovered between signaling systems in bacteria and plants--suggest that early versions of the cell-signaling mechanisms used today evolved well before the first multicellular creatures appeared on Earth. Scientists think that signaling mechanisms evolved first in ancient prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes and were then adopted for new uses by their multicellular descendants. Meanwhile, cell signaling has remained important in the microbial world. FIGURE 11.2 shows an example in a sophisticated modern bacterium.

Fig 11-2. Communication among bacteria. Soil-dwelling bacteria called myxobacteria ("slime bacteria") use chemical signaling to share information about nutrient availability. When food is scarce, starving cells secrete a molecule that enters neighboring cells and stimulates them to aggregate. The cells form a structure that produces thick-walled spores capable of surviving until the environment improves. The bacteria shown here are Myxococcus xanthus.





 Communicating cells may be close together or far apart

Like microbes, cells in a multicellular organism usually communicate by releasing chemical messengers targeted for cells that may not be immediately adjacent. Some messengers travel only short distances: The transmitting cell secretes molecules of a local regulator, a substance that influences cells in the vicinity (FIGURE 11.3a). One class of local regulators in animals, growth factors, are compounds that stimulate nearby target cells to grow and multiply. Numerous cells can simultaneously receive and respond to the molecules of growth factor produced by a single cell in their vicinity. This type of local signaling in animals is called paracrine signaling.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 11-3. Local and long-distance cell communication in animals. In both local and long-distance signaling, only specific target cells recognize and respond to a given chemical signal.

Another, more specialized type of local signaling occurs in the animal nervous system. Here a nerve cell produces a chemical signal, a neurotransmitter, that diffuses to a single target cell that is almost touching the first cell. An electrical signal transmitted the length of the nerve cell triggers the secretion of neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse, the narrow space between the nerve cell and its target cell (often another nerve cell). Because specific nerve cells are so close together at synapses, a nerve signal can travel along a series of nerve cells from your brain to your big toe, for example, without causing unwanted responses in other parts of your body.

Local signaling in plants is not as well understood. Because of their cell walls, plants must use mechanisms different from those operating locally in animals.

Both animals and plants use chemicals called hormones for signaling at greater distances. In hormonal signaling in animals, also known as endocrine signaling, specialized cells release hormone molecules into vessels of the circulatory system, by which they travel to target cells in other parts of the body (FIGURE 11.3b). In plants, hormones sometimes travel in vessels but more often reach their targets by moving through cells (see FIGURE 39.6) or by diffusion through the air as a gas. Hormones range widely in molecular size and type, as do local regulators. For instance, the plant hormone ethylene, a gas that promotes fruit ripening and helps regulate growth, is a hydrocarbon of only six atoms (C2H4). In contrast, the mammalian hormone insulin, which regulates sugar levels in the blood, is a protein with thousands of atoms.

Cells may also communicate by direct contact, as we saw in Chapters 7 and 8. Both animals and plants have cell junctions that, where present, directly connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells (FIGURE 11.4a on p. 200). In these cases, signaling substances dissolved in the cytosol can pass freely between adjacent cells. Moreover, animal cells may communicate via direct contact between molecules on their surfaces (FIGURE 11.4b on p. 200). This sort of signaling is important in embryonic development and in the operation of the immune system.

Fig 11-4. Communication by direct contact between cells.

What happens when a cell encounters a signal? The signal must be recognized by a specific receptor molecule, and the information it carries must be changed into another form--transduced--inside the cell before the cell can respond. The remainder of the chapter discusses this process, primarily as it occurs in animal cells.





 The three stages of cell signaling are reception, transduction, and response

Our current understanding of how chemical messengers act via signal-transduction pathways had its origins in the pioneering work of Earl W. Sutherland, whose research led to a Nobel Prize in 1971. Sutherland and his colleagues at Vanderbilt University were investigating how the animal hormone epinephrine stimulates breakdown (depolymerization) of the storage polysaccharide glycogen within liver cells and skeletal muscle cells. Glycogen depolymerization releases the sugar glucose-1-phosphate, which the cell converts to glucose-6-phosphate. The cell can then use this compound, an early intermediate in glycolysis, for energy production. Alternatively, the compound can be stripped of phosphate and released into the blood as glucose, which can fuel cells throughout the body. Thus, one effect of epinephrine, which is secreted from the adrenal gland during times of physical or mental stress, is the mobilization of fuel reserves.

Sutherland's research team discovered that epinephrine stimulates glycogen breakdown by somehow activating a cytosolic enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase. However, when epinephrine was added to a test-tube mixture containing the phosphorylase and its substrate, glycogen, no depolymerization occurred. Epinephrine could activate glycogen phosphorylase only when the hormone was added to a solution containing intact cells. This result told Sutherland two things. First, epinephrine does not interact directly with the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown; an intermediate step or series of steps must be occurring inside the cell. Second, the plasma membrane is somehow involved in transmitting the epinephrine signal.

Sutherland's early work suggested that the process going on at the receiving end of a cellular conversation can be dissected into three stages: reception, transduction, and response (FIGURE 11.5):

Fig 11-5. Overview of cell signaling. From the perspective of the cell receiving the message, cell signaling can be divided into three stages: signal reception, signal transduction, and cellular response. When reception occurs at the plasma membrane, as shown here, the transduction stage is usually a pathway of several steps, with each molecule in the pathway bringing about a change in the next. The last molecule in the pathway triggers the cell's response. The three stages are explained in the text.


			  
		Reception. Reception is the target cell's detection of a signal coming from outside the cell. A chemical signal is "detected" when it binds to a cellular protein, usually at the cell's surface.


			  
		Transduction. The binding of the signal molecule changes the receptor protein in some way, initiating the process of transduction. The transduction stage converts the signal to a form that can bring about a specific cellular response. In Sutherland's system, the binding of epinephrine to the outside of a receptor protein in a liver cell's plasma membrane leads via a series of steps to activation of glycogen phosphorylase. Transduction sometimes occurs in a single step but more often requires a sequence of changes in a series of different molecules--a signal-transduction pathway. The molecules in the pathway are often called relay molecules.


			  
		Response. In the third stage of cell signaling, the transduced signal finally triggers a specific cellular response. The response may be almost any imaginable cellular activity--such as catalysis by an enzyme (for example, glycogen phosphorylase), rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, or activation of specific genes in the nucleus. The cell-signaling process helps ensure that crucial activities like these occur in the right cells, at the right time, and in proper coordination with the other cells of the organism.

We'll now explore the mechanisms of cell signaling in more detail.





 A signal molecule binds to a receptor protein, causing the protein to change shape

A cell targeted by a particular chemical signal has molecules of a receptor protein that recognize the signal molecule. The signal molecule is complementary in shape to a specific site on the receptor and attaches there, like a key in a lock or a substrate in the catalytic site of an enzyme. The signal molecule behaves as a ligand, the term for a small molecule that specifically binds to a larger one. Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in conformation--that is, to change shape. For many receptors, this shape change directly activates the receptor so that it can interact with another cellular molecule. For other kinds of receptors, as we'll see shortly, the immediate effect of ligand binding is more limited, mainly causing the aggregation of two or more receptor molecules.





 Most signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins

Most signal molecules are water-soluble and too large to pass freely through the plasma membrane. But as Sutherland learned for epinephrine, they can still influence cellular activity in major ways. Like yeast mating factors, most water-soluble signal molecules bind to specific sites on receptor proteins embedded in the cell's plasma membrane. Such a receptor transmits information from the extracellular environment to the inside of the cell by changing shape or aggregating when a specific ligand binds to it.

We'll see how membrane receptors work by looking at three major types: G-protein-linked receptors, tyrosine-kinase receptors, and ion-channel receptors.

G-Protein-Linked Receptors

A G-protein-linked receptor is a plasma membrane receptor that works with the help of a protein called a G protein. Many different signal molecules use G-protein-linked receptors, including yeast mating factors, epinephrine and many other hormones, and neurotransmitters. These receptors vary in their binding sites for recognizing signal molecules and for recognizing different G proteins inside the cell. Nevertheless, G-protein-linked receptor proteins are all remarkably similar in structure. They each have seven a helices spanning the membrane, as shown in FIGURE 11.6.

Fig 11-6. The structure of a G-protein-linked receptor. A large family of eukaryotic receptor proteins have this secondary structure, where the single polypeptide, represented as a ribbon, has seven transmembrane a helices. For clarity, the a helices are depicted as cylinders and arranged in a straight line. Specific loops correspond to the sites where signal molecules and G-protein molecules bind; the loops labeled here are the binding sites in one particular case.

Loosely attached to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the G protein functions as a switch that is on or off, depending on which of two guanine nucleotides is attached, GDP or GTP. (GTP, or guanosine triphosphate, is similar to ATP.) As indicated in FIGURE 11.7 (p. 202), when GDP is bound, the G protein is inactive; when GTP is bound, the G protein is active.

Fig 11-7. The functioning of a G-protein-linked receptor. This type of receptor is a membrane protein that works in conjunction with a G protein and another protein, usually an enzyme.

The steps in FIGURE 11.7b show how the appropriate chemical signal activates the entire G-protein system. When the signal molecule binds as a ligand to the extracellular side of a G-protein-linked receptor, 
			  
		 the receptor is activated, changing conformation in such a way that it, in turn, binds a specific, inactive G protein and 
			  
		 causes a GTP to displace the GDP. This activates the G protein, which then 
			  
		 binds to another protein, usually an enzyme, and alters its activity. If the enzyme is activated, 
			  
		 it can trigger the next step in the pathway.

The changes in the enzyme and G protein are only temporary, for the G protein also functions as a GTPase enzyme and soon hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP (FIGURE 11.7c). Now inactive again, the G protein leaves the enzyme, which returns to its original state. The GTPase function of the G protein allows the pathway to shut down rapidly when the extracellular signal molecule is no longer present.

G-protein receptor systems are extremely widespread and diverse in their functions. In addition to the functions already mentioned, they are important in embryonic development, as indicated by genetic studies. For instance, mutant mouse embryos lacking a certain G protein do not develop normal blood vessels and die in utero. Furthermore, G proteins are involved in sensory reception; in humans, for example, both vision and smell depend on such proteins. Similarities in structure among G proteins and G-protein-linked receptors of modern organisms suggest that G proteins and G-protein-linked receptors evolved very early, possibly as sensory receptors of ancient microbes.

G-protein systems are involved in many human diseases, including bacterial infections. The bacteria that cause cholera, pertussis (whooping cough), and botulism, among others, make their victims ill by producing toxins that interfere with G-protein function. Drugs for treating infections and other kinds of diseases have often been discovered by trial and error, but pharmacologists now realize that up to 60%  of all medicines used today exert their effects by influencing G-protein pathways.

Tyrosine-Kinase Receptors

Among the chemical signals impinging on cells in an animal's body are growth factors, the local regulators that stimulate cells to grow and reproduce. As we'll see in Chapter 12, cell reproduction involves a variety of activities by different parts of the cell, including protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, chromosome duplication in the nucleus, and the rearrangement of elements of the cytoskeleton. Helping the cell regulate and coordinate these activities is a type of receptor specialized for triggering more than one signal-transduction pathway at once.

The receptor for a growth factor is often a tyrosine-kinase receptor, one of a major class of plasma membrane receptors characterized by having enzymatic activity. Part of the receptor protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane functions as an enzyme, called tyrosine kinase, that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to the amino acid tyrosine on a substrate protein. Thus tyrosine-kinase receptors are membrane receptors that attach phosphates to protein tyrosines.

Many tyrosine-kinase receptors have the structure roughly depicted in FIGURE 11.8. Before the signal molecule binds, the receptors exist as individual polypeptides. Notice that each has an extracellular signal-binding site, a single a helix spanning the membrane, and an intracellular tail containing a number of tyrosines. The binding of a signal molecule to such a receptor does not cause enough of a conformational change to activate the cytoplasmic side of the protein directly. Instead, as shown in FIGURE 11.8b, receptor activation occurs in two steps: 
			  
		 The ligand binding causes two receptor polypeptides to aggregate, forming a dimer (a protein consisting of two polypeptides). 
			  
		 This aggregation activates the tyrosine-kinase parts of both polypeptides, each of which then adds phosphates to the tyrosines on the tail of the other polypeptide. In summary, the effect of the signal molecule on a tyrosine-kinase receptor is polypeptide aggregation and phosphorylation of the receptor.

Fig 11-8. The structure and function of a tyrosine-kinase receptor.

Now that the receptor protein is fully activated, 
			  
		 it is recognized by specific relay proteins inside the cell. Each such protein binds to a specific phosphorylated tyrosine, undergoing a structural change that activates it (the relay protein may or may not be phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase). One tyrosine-kinase receptor dimer may activate ten or more different intracellular proteins simultaneously, 
			  
		 triggering as many different transduction pathways and cellular responses. The ability of a single ligand-binding event to trigger so many pathways is a key difference between these receptors and G-protein-linked receptors. Abnormal tyrosine-kinase receptors that aggregate even without ligand cause some kinds of cancer.

Ion-Channel Receptors

Some membrane receptors of chemical signals are ligand-gated ion channels. These channels are protein pores in the plasma membrane that open or close in response to a chemical signal, allowing or blocking the flow of specific ions, such as Na+ or Ca2+. Like the other receptors we have discussed, these channel proteins bind a signal molecule as a ligand at a specific site on their extracellular side (FIGURE 11.9). The shape change produced in the channel protein immediately leads to a change in the concentration of a particular ion inside the cell. Often this change directly affects cell functioning in some way. At a synapse between nerve cells, for example, it may trigger an electrical signal that propagates down the length of the receiving cell. Ligand-gated ion channels are very important in the nervous system, as are gated ion channels that are controlled by electrical signals (see Chapter 48).

Fig 11-9. A ligand-gated ion-channel receptor. This receptor is a transmembrane protein in the plasma membrane that opens to allow the flow of a specific kind of ion across the membrane when a specific signal molecule binds to the extracellular side of the protein.

Intracellular Receptors

Not all signal receptors are membrane proteins. Some are proteins dissolved in the cytosol or nucleus of target cells. To reach such a receptor, a chemical messenger must be able to pass through the target cell's plasma membrane. A number of important signaling molecules can do just that because they are hydrophobic enough to cross the phospholipid interior of the membrane. Such hydrophobic chemical messengers include the steroid hormones and thyroid hormones of animals. Another chemical signal with an intracellular receptor is nitric oxide (NO), a gas; its very small molecules readily pass between the membrane phospholipids.

The behavior of testosterone is representative of steroid hormones: Secreted by cells of the testis, the hormone travels through the blood and enters cells all over the body. In target cells, which contain receptor molecules for testosterone in their cytosol, the hormone binds to the receptor protein, activating it (FIGURE 11.10). With the hormone attached, the active form of the receptor protein then enters the nucleus and turns on specific genes that control male sex characteristics.

Fig 11-10. Steroid hormone interacting with an intracellular receptor.

How does the activated hormone-receptor protein turn on genes? Recall that the genes in a cell's DNA function by being transcribed into an RNA version called messenger RNA (mRNA), which leaves the nucleus and is translated into a specific protein by ribosomes in the cytoplasm (see FIGURE 5.28). Special proteins called transcription factors control which genes are turned on--that is, which genes are transcribed into mRNA--in a particular cell at a particular time. The activated testosterone receptor is a transcription factor that regulates specific genes.

By acting as a transcription factor, the testosterone receptor itself carries out the complete transduction of the signal. Most other intracellular receptors function in the same way, although many of them are already in the nucleus before the signal molecule reaches them (for example, estrogen receptors). Interestingly, many of these intracellular receptor proteins are structurally similar, suggesting an evolutionary kinship analogous to that displayed by G-protein-linked receptors. We will look more closely at hormones with intracellular receptors in Chapter 45. In the next section, we focus on signal-transduction pathways triggered by membrane receptors.





 Pathways relay signals from receptors to cellular responses

The binding of a specific signal molecule to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the chain of molecular interactions--the signal-transduction pathway--that leads to a particular response within the cell. Like falling dominoes, the signal-activated receptor activates another protein, which activates another molecule, and so on, until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated. The molecules that relay a signal from receptor to response, sometimes called relay molecules, are mostly proteins. The interaction of proteins is a major theme of cell signaling. Indeed, protein interaction is a unifying theme of all regulation at the cellular level.

Keep in mind that the original signal molecule is not physically passed along a signaling pathway; in most cases, it never even enters the cell. When we say that the signal is relayed along a pathway, we mean that certain information is passed on. At each step the signal is transduced into a different form, commonly a conformational change in a protein. Very often, the conformational change is brought about by phosphorylation.





 Protein phosphorylation, a common mode of regulation in cells, is a major mechanism of signal transduction

Previous chapters introduced the concept of activating a protein by adding one or more phosphate groups to it (see FIGURE 9.2). In this chapter, we have already seen how phosphorylation is involved in the activation of tyrosine-kinase receptors. In fact, the phosphorylation of proteins is a widespread cellular mechanism for regulating protein activity. The general name for an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to a protein is protein kinase. Unlike receptor tyrosine kinases, most cytoplasmic protein kinases act not on themselves, but on other substrate proteins; also, most phosphorylate their substrates on either of two other amino acids, serine or threonine. Such serine/threonine kinases are widely involved in signaling pathways in animals, plants, and fungi.

Many of the relay molecules in signal-transduction pathways are protein kinases, and they often act on each other. FIGURE 11.11 (p. 206) depicts a hypothetical pathway containing three different protein kinases, which create a "phosphorylation cascade." The sequence shown is similar to many known pathways, including those triggered in yeast by mating factors and in animal cells by many growth factors. The signal is transmitted by a cascade of protein phosphorylations, each bringing with it a conformational change. Each shape change results from the interaction of the charged phosphate groups with charged or polar amino acids (see FIGURE 5.15). The addition of phosphates often changes a protein from an inactive form to an active form (although in other cases phosphorylation decreases the activity of the protein).

Fig 11-11. A phosphorylation cascade. In a phosphorylation cascade, a series of different molecules in a pathway are phosphorylated in turn, each molecule adding a phosphate group to the next one in line. The phosphorylation cascade shown here begins after a relay molecule activates an enzyme we call protein kinase 1. 
			  
		 Active protein kinase 1 transfers a phosphate from ATP to an inactive molecule of protein kinase 2, thus activating this second kinase. 
			  
		 Active protein kinase 2 then catalyzes the phosphorylation (and activation) of protein kinase 3. 
			  
		 Finally, active protein kinase 3 phosphorylates a protein (pink) that brings about the cell's response to the signal. The dashed arrows represent inactivation of the phosphorylated proteins; enzymes called phosphatases catalyze the removal of the phosphate groups from the proteins, making them available for reuse. The active and inactive proteins are represented by different shapes to remind you that activation is usually associated with a change in molecular conformation.

The importance of protein kinases can hardly be overstated. Fully 1%  of our own genes are thought to code for protein kinases. A single cell may have hundreds of different kinds, each specific for a different substrate protein. Together, they probably regulate a large proportion of the thousands of proteins in a cell. Among these are most of the proteins that, in turn, regulate cell reproduction. Abnormal activity of such a kinase frequently causes abnormal cell growth and contributes to the development of cancer.

For a cell to respond normally to an extracellular signal, it must have mechanisms for turning off the signal-transduction pathway when the initial signal is no longer present. The effects of protein kinases are rapidly reversed in the cell by protein phosphatases, enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins. At any given moment, the activity of a protein regulated by phosphorylation depends on the balance in the cell between active kinase molecules and active phosphatase molecules. When the extracellular signal molecule is not present, active phosphatase molecules predominate, and the signaling pathway and cellular response shut down.





 Certain small molecules and ions are key components of signaling pathways (second messengers)

Not all components of signal-transduction pathways are proteins. Many signaling pathways also involve small, nonprotein, water-soluble molecules or ions, called second messengers. (The extracellular signal molecule that binds to the membrane receptor is a pathway's "first messenger.") Because second messengers are both small and water-soluble, they can readily spread throughout the cell by diffusion. For example, as we'll see shortly, it is a second messenger called cyclic AMP that carries the signal initiated by epinephrine from the plasma membrane of a liver or muscle cell into the cell's interior, where it brings about glycogen breakdown. Second messengers participate in pathways initiated by both G-protein-linked receptors and tyrosine-kinase receptors. The two most widely used second messengers are cyclic AMP and calcium ions, Ca2+. A large variety of relay proteins are sensitive to the cytosolic concentration of one or the other of these second messengers.

Cyclic AMP

Once Earl Sutherland had established that epinephrine somehow causes glycogen breakdown without passing through the plasma membrane, the search began for the second messenger (he coined the term) that transmits the signal from the plasma membrane to the metabolic machinery in the cytoplasm.

Sutherland found that the binding of epinephrine to the plasma membrane of a liver cell elevates the cytosolic concentration of a compound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, abbreviated cyclic AMP or cAMP (FIGURE 11.12). An enzyme built into the plasma membrane, adenylyl cyclase, converts ATP to cAMP in response to an extracellular signal--in this case, epinephrine. Adenylyl cyclase becomes active only after epinephrine binds to a specific receptor protein. Thus, the first messenger, the hormone, causes a membrane enzyme to make cAMP, which broadcasts the signal to the cytoplasm. The cAMP does not persist for long in the absence of the hormone, because another enzyme converts the cAMP to an inactive product, AMP. Another surge of epinephrine is needed to boost the cytosolic concentration of cAMP again.

Fig 11-12. Cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is made from ATP by adenylyl cyclase, an emzyme embedded in the plasma membrane. Cyclic AMP functions as a second messenger that can relay a signal from the membrane to the metabolic machinery of the cytoplasm. Cyclic AMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that converts it to AMP.

Subsequent research revealed that epinephrine is only one of many hormones and other signal molecules that trigger the formation of cAMP. It also brought to light the other components of cAMP pathways, including G proteins, G-protein-linked receptors, and protein kinases (FIGURE 11.13). The immediate effect of cAMP is usually the activation of a serine/ threonine kinase called protein kinase A. The activated kinase then phosphorylates various other proteins, depending on the cell. (The complete pathway for epinephrine's stimulation of glycogen breakdown is shown later, in FIGURE 11.16.)

Fig 11-13. cAMP as a second messenger. Cyclic AMP is a component of many G-protein-signaling pathways. The signal molecule-- the "first messenger"--activates a G-protein-linked receptor, which activates a specific G protein. In turn, the G protein activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. The cAMP then activates another protein, usually protein kinase A.

Fig 11-16. Cytoplasmic response to a signal: the stimulation of glycogen breakdown by epinephrine. (a) In this signaling system, the hormone epinephrine acts through a G-protein-linked receptor to activate a succession of relay molecules, including cAMP and two protein kinases. The final protein to be activated is the cytosolic enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which releases glucose-1-phosphate units from glycogen. (b) As discussed in the next section of the text, this pathway amplifies the hormonal signal, because the receptor protein can activate many molecules of G protein, and each enzyme molecule in the pathway can act on many molecules of its substrate, the next molecule in the cascade. The number of activated molecules given for each step is only approximate.

Further fine-tuning of cell metabolism is provided by other G-protein systems that inhibit adenylyl cyclase. In these systems, a different signal molecule activates a different receptor, which activates an inhibitory G protein.

Now that we know about the role of cAMP in G-protein-signaling pathways, we can explain in molecular detail how certain microbes cause disease. Consider cholera, a disease that is frequently epidemic in places where the water supply is contaminated with human feces. People acquire the cholera bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, by drinking contaminated water. The bacteria colonize the lining of the small intestine and produce a toxin, which is an enzyme that chemically modifies a G protein involved in regulating salt and water secretion. Because the modified G protein is unable to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, it remains stuck in its active form, continuously stimulating adenylyl cyclase to make cAMP. The resulting high concentration of cAMP causes the intestinal cells to secrete large amounts of water and salts into the intestines. An infected person quickly develops profuse diarrhea and if left untreated can soon die from the loss of water and salts.

Calcium Ions and Inositol Trisphosphate

Many signal molecules in animals, including neurotransmitters, growth factors, and some hormones, induce responses in their target cells via signal-transduction pathways that increase the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+). Calcium is even more widely used than cAMP as a second messenger. Increasing the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ causes many responses in animal cells, including muscle cell contraction, secretion of certain substances, and cell division. In plant cells, calcium functions as a second messenger in signaling pathways plants have evolved for coping with environmental stresses, such as drought or cold. Cells use Ca2+ as a second messenger in both G-protein pathways and tyrosine-kinase pathways.

Although cells always contain some Ca2+, this ion can function as a second messenger because its concentration in the cytosol is normally much lower than the concentration outside the cell. In fact, the level of Ca2+ in the blood and extracellular fluid of an animal often exceeds that in the cytosol by more than 10,000 times. Calcium ions are actively transported out of the cell and are actively imported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (and, under some conditions, into mitochondria and chloroplasts) by various protein pumps (FIGURE 11.14). As a result, the calcium concentration in the ER is usually much higher than in the cytosol. Because the cytosolic calcium level is low, a small change in absolute numbers of ions represents a relatively large percentage change in calcium concentration.

Fig 11-14. The maintenance of calcium ion concentrations in an animal cell. The Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol is usually much lower (light blue) than in the extracellular fluid and ER (darker blue). Protein pumps in the plasma membrane and the ER membrane move Ca2+ from the cytosol into the extracellular fluid and into the lumen of the ER. Mitochondrial pumps, driven by chemiosmosis (see Chapter 9), move Ca2+ into mitochondria when the calcium level in the cytosol rises significantly.

In response to a signal relayed by a signal-transduction pathway, the cytosolic calcium level may rise, usually by a mechanism that releases Ca2+ from the cell's ER. The pathways leading to calcium release involve still other second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). These two messengers are produced by cleavage of a certain kind of phospholipid in the plasma membrane. FIGURE 11.15 shows how this occurs and how IP3 stimulates the release of calcium from the ER. Because IP3 acts before calcium in these pathways, calcium could be considered a "third messenger." However, scientists use the term second messenger for all small, nonprotein components of signal-transduction pathways.

Fig 11-15. Calcium and inositol trisphosphate in signaling pathways. Calcium ions (Ca2+) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) function as second messengers in many signal-transduction pathways. The process is initiated by the binding of a signal molecule to either a G-protein-linked receptor (left) or a tyrosine-kinase receptor (right). The circled numbers trace the former pathway.

In some cases, calcium ions activate a signal-transduction protein directly, but often they function by means of calmodulin, a Ca2+-binding protein present at high levels in eukaryotic cells. (In an animal cell, for example, calmodulin may represent as much as 1%  of the total protein.) Calmodulin mediates many calcium-regulated processes in cells. When calcium ions bind to it, calmodulin changes conformation and then binds to other proteins, activating or inactivating them. The proteins most often regulated by calmodulin are protein kinases and phosphatases--the most common relay proteins in signaling pathways.





 In response to a signal, a cell may regulate activities in the cytoplasm or transcription in the nucleus

Ultimately, a signal-transduction pathway leads to the regulation of one or more cellular activities. In the cytoplasm, a signal may cause, for example, the opening or closing of an ion channel in the plasma membrane or a change in cell metabolism. As we have discussed already, the response of liver cells to signaling by the hormone epinephrine helps regulate cellular energy metabolism. The final step in the signaling pathway activates the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen. FIGURE 11.16 shows the complete pathway leading to the release of glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen.

Many other signaling pathways ultimately regulate not the activity of enzymes but the synthesis of enzymes or other proteins, usually by turning specific genes on or off in the nucleus. Like an activated steroid receptor (see FIGURE 11.10), the final activated molecule in a signaling pathway may function as a transcription factor. In FIGURE 11.17, you see an example where a signaling pathway activates a transcription factor that turns a gene on: The response to the growth-factor signal is the synthesis of mRNA that will be translated in the cytoplasm into a specific protein. In other cases, the transcription factor might regulate a gene by turning it off. Often a transcription factor regulates several different genes.

Fig 11-17. Nuclear response to a signal: the activation of a specific gene by a growth factor. This diagram is a simplified representation of a typical signaling pathway that leads to the regulation of gene activity in the cell nucleus. The initial signal molecule, a local regulator called a growth factor, triggers a phosphorylation cascade. (The ATP molecules that serve as sources of phosphate are not shown.) The last kinase in the sequence enters the nucleus and there activates a gene-regulating protein, a transcription factor. This protein stimulates a specific gene to be transcribed into mRNA, which then directs the synthesis of a particular protein in the cytoplasm.

All the different kinds of signal receptors and relay molecules introduced in this chapter participate in various gene-regulating pathways, as well as in pathways leading to other kinds of responses. The molecular messengers that produce gene regulation responses include growth factors and certain plant and animal hormones. Malfunctioning of growth-factor pathways like the one in FIGURE 11.17 can cause cancer, as we will see in Chapter 19.





 Elaborate pathways amplify and specify the cell's response to signals

Why are there often so many steps between a signaling event at the cell surface and the cell's response? As mentioned earlier, signaling pathways with a multiplicity of steps have two important benefits: They amplify the signal (and thus the response), and they contribute to the specificity of response.

Signal Amplification

Elaborate enzyme cascades amplify the cell's response to a signal. At each catalytic step in the cascade, the number of activated products is much greater than in the preceding step. For example, in the epinephrine-triggered pathway in FIGURE 11.16, each adenylyl cyclase molecule catalyzes the formation of many cAMP molecules, each molecule of protein kinase A phosphorylates many molecules of the next kinase in the pathway, and so on. The amplification effect stems from the fact that these proteins persist in active form long enough to process numerous molecules of substrate before they become inactive again. As a result of the signal's amplification, a small number of epinephrine molecules binding to receptors on the surface of a liver cell or muscle cell can lead to the release of hundreds of millions of glucose molecules from glycogen.

The Specificity of Cell Signaling

Consider two different cells in your body--a liver cell and a heart muscle cell, for example. Both are in contact with your bloodstream and are therefore constantly exposed to many different hormone molecules, as well as to local regulators secreted by nearby cells. Yet the liver cell responds to some signals but ignores others, and the same is true for the heart cell. And some kinds of signals trigger responses in both cells--but different responses. For instance, epinephrine stimulates the liver cell to break down glycogen, but the main response of the heart cell to epinephrine is contraction, leading to a more rapid heartbeat. How do we account for this difference?

The explanation for the specificity exhibited in cellular responses to signals is the same as the basic explanation for virtually all differences between cells: Different kinds of cells have different collections of proteins (FIGURE 11.18). The response of a particular cell to a signal depends on its particular collection of signal receptor proteins, relay proteins, and proteins needed to carry out the response. A liver cell, for example, is poised to respond appropriately to epinephrine by having the proteins listed in FIGURE 11.16, as well as those needed to manufacture glycogen.

Fig 11-18. The specificity of cell signaling. The particular proteins a cell possesses determine what signal molecules it responds to and the nature of the response. The four cells in these diagrams respond to the same signal molecule (orange triangle) in different ways, because each has a different set of proteins (purple and green shapes). Note, however, that the same kinds of molecules can participate in more than one pathway.

Thus, two cells that respond differently to the same signal differ in one or more of the proteins that handle and respond to the signal. Notice in FIGURE 11.18 that different pathways may have some molecules in common. For example, cells A, B, and C all use the same receptor protein for the triangular signal molecule; differences in other proteins account for their differing responses. In cell B, a pathway triggered by a single kind of signal diverges to produce two responses; such branched pathways often involve tyrosine-kinase receptors (which can activate multiple relay proteins) or second messengers (which can regulate numerous proteins). In cell C, two pathways triggered by separate signals converge to modulate a single response. Branching of pathways and "cross-talk" (interaction) between pathways are important in regulating and coordinating a cell's responses to incoming information. Moreover, the use of some of the same proteins in more than one pathway allows the cell to economize on the number of different proteins it must make.

The signaling pathways in FIGURE 11.18 (as well as some of the other pathway depictions in this chapter) are greatly simplified. The diagrams show only a few relay molecules and, for clarity's sake, display these molecules spread out in the cytosol. If this were true in the cell, signaling pathways would operate very inefficiently, because most relay molecules are proteins, and proteins are too large to diffuse quickly through the viscous cytosol. How does a particular protein kinase, for instance, find its substrate? Recent research suggests that the efficiency of signal transduction may in many cases be increased by the presence of scaffolding proteins, large relay proteins to which several other relay proteins are simultaneously attached. For example, one scaffolding protein isolated from mouse brain cells holds three protein kinases and carries these kinases with it when it binds to an appropriately activated membrane receptor; it thus facilitates a specific phosphorylation cascade (FIGURE 11.19). In fact, researchers are finding scaffolding proteins in brain cells that permanently hold together networks of signaling-pathway proteins at synapses (see FIGURE 2.18). This hardwiring enhances the speed and accuracy of signal transfer between cells.

Fig 11-19. A scaffolding protein. The scaffolding protein shown here (pink) simultaneously binds to a specific activated membrane receptor and three different protein kinases. This physical arrangement facilitates signal transduction by these molecules.

The importance of the relay proteins that serve as points of branching or intersection in signaling pathways is highlighted by the problems arising when these proteins are defective or missing. For instance, in an inherited disorder called Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), the absence of a single relay protein leads to such diverse effects as abnormal bleeding, eczema, and a predisposition to infections and leukemia. These symptoms are thought to arise primarily from the absence of the protein in cells of the immune system. By studying normal cells, scientists found that the WAS protein is located just beneath the cell surface. The protein interacts both with microfilaments of the cytoskeleton and with several different components of signaling pathways that relay information from the cell surface, including pathways regulating immune cell proliferation. This multifunctional relay protein is thus both a branch point and an important intersection point in a complex signal transduction network that controls immune cell behavior. When the WAS protein is absent, the cytoskeleton is not properly organized and signaling pathways are disrupted, leading to the WAS symptoms.

To keep FIGURE 11.18 simple, we have not indicated the inactivation mechanisms that are an essential aspect of cell signaling. For a cell of a multicellular organism to remain alert and capable of responding to incoming signals, each molecular change in its signaling pathways must last only a short time. As we saw in the cholera example, if a signaling pathway component becomes locked into one state, whether active or inactive, dire consequences for the organism can result.

Thus, a key to a cell's continuing receptiveness to regulation is the reversibility of the changes that signals produce. The binding of signal molecules to receptors is reversible, with the result that the lower the concentration of signal molecules, the fewer will be bound at any given moment. When they leave the receptor, the receptor reverts to its inactive form. Then, by a variety of means, the relay molecules return to their inactive forms: The GTPase activity intrinsic to a G protein hydrolyzes its bound GTP; the enzyme phosphodiesterase converts cAMP to AMP; protein phosphatases inactivate phosphorylated kinases and other proteins; and so forth. As a result, the cell is soon ready to respond to a fresh signal.

This chapter has introduced you to a number of details of cellular signal processing. More important than the details, however, are the general mechanisms of cell communication--mechanisms involving ligand binding, conformational changes in proteins, interactions among proteins, cascades of interactions that transduce and amplify signals, and protein phosphorylations by kinases. As you continue through the text, you will encounter numerous examples of cell signaling. In the very next chapter, in fact, you'll learn about the enormously important role of cell signaling in the regulation of cell reproduction.

The ability of organisms to reproduce their kind is the one characteristic that best distinguishes living things from nonliving matter. This unique capacity to procreate, like all biological functions, has a cellular basis. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, put it this way in 1855: "Where a cell exists, there must have been a preexisting cell, just as the animal arises only from an animal and the plant only from a plant." He summarized with the Latin axiom,"Omnis cellula e cellula,"meaning "Every cell from a cell." The continuity of life is based on the reproduction of cells, or cell division. The series of images in the micrograph on this page follows an animal cell's chromosomes through one round of cell division, starting at the lower left.

In this chapter, you will learn how cells reproduce to form genetically equivalent daughter cells.*This division process is an integral part of the cell cycle, the life of a cell from its origin in the division of a parent cell until its own division into two.

 Cancer cells have escaped from cell cycle controls



The timing and rate of cell division in different parts of a plant or animal are crucial to normal growth, development, and maintenance. The frequency of cell division varies with the type of cell. For example, human skin cells divide frequently throughout life, whereas liver cells maintain the ability to divide but keep it in reserve until an appropriate need arises--say, to repair a wound. Some of the most specialized cells, such as mature nerve cells and muscle cells, do not divide at all in a mature human. These cell cycle differences result from regulation at the molecular level. The mechanisms of this regulation are of intense interest, not only for understanding the life cycles of normal cells but also for understanding how cancer cells manage to escape normal controls.





 Cell division functions in reproduction, growth, and repair

When a unicellular organism such as Amoeba divides to form duplicate offspring, the division of one cell reproduces an entire organism (FIGURE 12.1a, p. 216), and cell division on a larger scale can produce progeny from some multicellular organisms (such as plants that grow from cuttings). But cell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from a single cell--the fertilized egg, or zygote (FIGURE 12.1b). And after an organism is fully grown, cell division continues to function in renewal and repair, replacing cells that die from normal wear and tear or accidents. For example, dividing cells in your bone marrow continuously make new blood cells (FIGURE 12.1c).

Fig 12-1. 12.1 The functions of cell division (all LMs).

The reproduction of an ensemble as complex as a cell cannot occur by a mere pinching in half; the cell is not like a soap bubble that simply enlarges and splits in two. Cell division involves the distribution of identical genetic material--DNA--to two daughter cells. What is most remarkable about cell division is the fidelity with which the DNA is passed along, without dilution, from one generation of cells to the next. A dividing cell duplicates its DNA, allocates the two copies to opposite ends of the cell, and only then splits into daughter cells.





 Cell division distributes identical sets of chromosomes to daughter cells

A cell's endowment of DNA, its genetic information, is called its genome. Although a prokaryotic genome is often a single long DNA molecule, eukaryotic genomes usually consist of a number of DNA molecules. The overall length of DNA in a eukaryotic cell is enormous. A typical human cell, for example, has about 3 m of DNA--a length about 300,000 times greater than the cell's diameter. Yet before the cell can divide, all of this DNA must be copied and then the two copies separated so that each daughter cell ends up with a complete genome.

The replication and distribution of so much DNA is manageable because the DNA molecules are packaged into chromosomes, so named because they take up certain dyes used in microscopy (chromo, colored, and somes, bodies) (FIGURE 12.2). Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. For example, the nuclei of human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes. Reproductive cells, or gametes--sperm cells and egg cells--have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or 23 chromosomes in humans.

Fig 12-2. Eukaryotic chromosomes. A tangle of chromosomes (stained orange) is visible within the nucleus of this kangaroo rat epithelial cell. The cell is preparing to divide (LM).

Incorporated into each eukaryotic chromosome is one very long, linear DNA molecule representing hundreds or thousands of genes, the units that specify an organism's inherited traits. The DNA is associated with various proteins that maintain the structure of the chromosome and help control the activity of the genes. This DNA-protein complex, called chromatin, is organized into a long, thin fiber. After a cell duplicates its DNA in preparation for division, the chromatin condenses: It becomes densely coiled and folded, making the chromosomes much shorter and so thick that we can see them with a light microscope.

Each duplicated chromosome has two sister chromatids. The two chromatids, containing identical copies of the chromosome's DNA molecule, are initially attached by proteins all along their lengths. In its condensed form, the chromosome has a narrow "waist" at a specialized region called the centromere (FIGURE 12.3). Later in the cell division process, the sister chromatids of all the chromosomes are pulled apart and repackaged as complete chromosome sets in two new nuclei, one at each end of the cell. Mitosis, the division of the nucleus, is usually followed immediately by cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm. Where there was one cell, there are now two, each the genetic equivalent of the parent cell.

Fig 12-3. Chromosome duplication and distribution during mitosis. A eukaryotic cell preparing to divide duplicates each of its multiple chromosomes, one of which is represented here. A duplicated chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, which narrow at their centromeres. The micrograph shows a human chromosome in this state (SEM). Each chromatid consists of one very long chromatin fiber folded and coiled in a compact arrangement. The DNA molecules of the sister chromatids are identical. As mitosis continues, mechanical processes separate the sister chromatids and distribute them to two daughter cells. Chromosomes normally exist in the highly condensed state here only during the process of mitosis.

What happens to chromosome number as we follow the human life cycle through the generations? You inherited 46 chromosomes, one set of 23 from each parent. They were combined in the nucleus of a single cell when a sperm cell from your father united with an egg cell from your mother to form a fertilized egg, or zygote. Mitosis and cytokinesis produced the trillions of somatic cells that now make up your body, and the same processes continue to generate new cells to replace dead and damaged ones. In contrast, you produce gametes--eggs or sperm cells--by a variation of cell division called meiosis, which yields daughter cells that have half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis occurs only in your gonads (ovaries or testes). In each generation of humans, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from 46 to 23. Fertilization fuses two gametes together and doubles the chromosome number to 46 again, and mitosis conserves that number in every somatic cell nucleus of the new individual. In Chapter 13, we will examine the role of meiosis in reproduction and inheritance in more detail. In the remainder of this chapter, we focus on mitosis and the rest of the mitotic cell cycle.





 The mitotic phase alternates with interphase in the cell cycle: an overview

Mitosis is just one part of the cell cycle (FIGURE 12.4). In fact, the mitotic (M) phase, which includes both mitosis and cytokinesis, is usually the shortest part of the cell cycle. Mitotic cell division alternates with a much longer interphase, which often accounts for about 90%  of the cycle. It is during interphase that the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Interphase can be divided into subphases: the G1phase ("first gap"), the S phase, and the G2phase ("second gap"). During all three subphases, the cell grows by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. However, chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase (S stands for synthesis of DNA). Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it copies its chromosomes (S), grows more as it completes preparations for cell division (G2), and divides (M). The daughter cells may then repeat the cycle.

Fig 12-4. The cell cycle. In a dividing cell, the mitotic (M) phase alternates with interphase, a growth period. The first part of interphase, called G1, is followed by the S phase, when the chromosomes replicate; the last part of interphase is called G2. In the M phase, mitosis divides the nucleus and distributes its chromosomes to the daughter nuclei, and cytokinessis divides the cytoplasm, producing two daughter cells.

Time-lapse films of living, dividing cells reveal the dynamics of mitosis as a continuum of changes. For purposes of description, however, mitosis is conventionally broken down into five subphases: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. FIGURE 12.5, on pages 218-219, describes these stages in an animal cell. Be sure to study this figure thoroughly before progressing to the next section, which examines mitosis more closely.

The chromosomes appear blue and the microtubules green. (The red fibers are intermediate filaments.) The schematic drawings show details not visible in the micrographs. For the sake of simplicity, only four chromosomes are drawn. (In plant cells, centrioles are lacking and cytokinesis occurs differently.





 The mitotic spindle distributes chromosomes to daughter cells: a closer look

Many of the events of mitosis depend on the mitotic spindle, which begins to form in the cytoplasm during prophase. This structure consists of fibers made of microtubules and associated proteins. While the mitotic spindle assembles, the microtubules of the cytoskeleton partially disassemble, probably providing the material used to construct the spindle. The spindle microtubules elongate by incorporating more subunits of the protein tubulin (see TABLE 7.2).

The assembly of spindle microtubules starts in the centrosome, a nonmembranous organelle that functions throughout the cell cycle to organize the cell's microtubules (it is also called the microtubule-organizing center). In animal cells, a pair of centrioles is located at the center of the centrosome, but the centrioles are not essential for cell division. In fact, the centrosomes of most plants lack centrioles, and if a researcher destroys the centrioles of an animal cell with a laser micro beam, a spindle nevertheless forms during mitosis.

During interphase, the single centrosome replicates to form two centrosomes (see FIGURE 12.5). As mitosis starts, the two centrosomes are located near the nucleus; they then move apart from each other during prophase and prometaphase, as spindle microtubules grow out from them. By the end of prometaphase, the two centrosomes, referred to as spindle poles in this context, are at opposite poles of the cell.

Each of the two joined chromatids of a chromosome has a kinetochore, a structure of proteins and specific sections of chromosomal DNA at the centromere. The chromosome's two kinetochores face in opposite directions. During prometaphase, some of the spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores. When one of a chromosome's kinetochores is "captured" by microtubules, the chromosome begins to move toward the pole from which those microtubules come. However, this movement is checked as soon as microtubules from the opposite pole attach to the other kinetochore. What happens next is like a tug-of-war that ends in a draw. The chromosome moves first in one direction, then the other, back and forth, finally settling midway between the two poles of the cell (FIGURE 12.6). Meanwhile, microtubules that do not attach to kinetochores interact with nonkinetochore microtubules from the opposite pole of the cell. At metaphase, these microtubules overlap, and the centromeres of all the duplicated chromosomes are on a plane midway between the two poles. This plane is called the metaphase plate of the cell. The spindle is now complete.

Fig 12-6. The mitotic spindle at metaphase.

Let's now see how the structure of the completed spindle correlates with its function during anaphase. Anaphase commences suddenly when proteins holding together the sister chromatids of each chromosome are inactivated. Now that the chromatids are separate, full-fledged chromosomes, they move toward opposite poles of the cell. How do the kinetochore microtubules function in this poleward movement of chromosomes? Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that kinetochores are equipped with motor proteins that "walk" a chromosome along the attached microtubules toward the nearest pole. Meanwhile, the microtubules shorten by depolymerizing at their kinetochore ends (FIGURE 12.7). (To review how motor proteins move an object along a microtubule, see FIGURE 7.21b.)



Click image to enlarge



Fig 12-7. Testing a hypothesis for chromosome migration during anaphase.

What is the function of the nonkinetochore microtubules? In a dividing animal cell, these microtubules are responsible for elongating the whole cell during anaphase (see FIGURE 12.5). Nonkinetochore microtubules interdigitate across the metaphase plate, and during anaphase ones originating from opposite spindle poles move past each other toward their poles. The mechanism seems to be similar to the one that slides neighboring microtubules in a flagellum: Motor proteins attached to the nonkinetochore microtubules drive them past one another, using energy from ATP (see FIGURE 7.21a). At the same time, the nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen by the addition of tubulin subunits to their ends.

At the end of anaphase, duplicate sets of chromosomes have arrived at opposite poles of the elongated parent cell. Nuclei re-form during telophase. Cytokinesis generally begins during this last stage of mitosis.





 Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm: a closer look

In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by a process known as cleavage. The first sign of cleavage is the appearance of a cleavage furrow, which begins as a shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate (FIGURE 12.8a). On the cytoplasmic side of the furrow is a contractile ring of actin microfilaments associated with molecules of the protein myosin. Actin and myosin are the same proteins responsible for muscle contraction, as well as many other kinds of cell movement. The contraction of the dividing cell's ring of microfilaments is like the pulling of drawstrings. The cleavage furrow deepens until the parent cell is pinched in two, producing two completely separated cells.

Fig 12-8. Cytokinesis in animal and plant cells.

Cytokinesis in plant cells, which have walls, is markedly different. There is no cleavage furrow. Instead, during telophase, vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cell, where they coalesce, producing a cell plate (FIGURE 12.8b). Cell wall materials carried in the vesicles collect in the cell plate as it grows. The cell plate enlarges until its surrounding membrane fuses with the plasma membrane along the perimeter of the cell. Two daughter cells result, each with its own plasma membrane. Meanwhile, a new cell wall arising from the contents of the cell plate has formed between the daughter cells.

FIGURE 12.9 is a series of micrographs of a dividing plant cell. Examining this figure will help you review mitosis and cytokinesis.

 Mitosis in eukaryotes may have evolved from binary fission in bacteria

The complex cellular choreography of mitotic cell division solves the problem of correctly distributing copies of eukaryotic genomes to daughter cells. How did mitosis evolve? Given that prokaryotes preceded eukaryotes on Earth by billions of years, we might hypothesize that mitosis had its origins in simpler bacterial mechanisms of cell reproduction.

Prokaryotes (bacteria) reproduce by a type of cell division called binary fission, meaning literally "division in half." Most bacterial genes are carried on a single bacterial chromosome that consists of a circular DNA molecule and associated proteins. Although bacteria are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells, the problem of replicating their genomes in an orderly fashion and distributing the copies equally to two daughter cells is still formidable. The chromosome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, for example, when it is fully stretched out, is about 500 times longer than the length of the cell. Clearly, such a long chromosome must be highly coiled and folded within the cell--and it is.

Prokaryotes do not have mitotic spindles, so what brings about the separation of the two daughter chromosomes in a dividing bacterial cell? A hypothesis proposed in the 1960s suggested that separation of bacterial chromosomes results simply from the growth of new plasma membrane between two sites on the membrane where the chromosome copies are attached. Recent research, however, has challenged this model (FIGURE 12.10, p. 224). Rather than being a passive process, separation of daughter bacterial chromosomes involves active chromosomal movement. Once the DNA of the chromosome begins to replicate, the copies of the first replicated region--called the origin of replication--move apart rapidly. Using the techniques of modern DNA technology to tag the origins of replication with molecules that glow green in fluorescence microscopy (see TABLE 7.1), researchers have directly observed the movement of bacterial chromosomes. This movement is reminiscent of the poleward movements of the centromere regions of eukaryotic chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis, even though bacteria don't have mitotic spindles or even microtubules. How bacterial chromosomes move is still a mystery. The idea that prokaryotes might have molecules in any way like the microtubules and motor proteins used in eukaryotic mitosis is surprising and intriguing.

Fig 12-10. Bacterial cell division (binary fission). The single, circular bacterial chromosome replicates, and the two copies move apart by an unknown mechanism. Meanwhile, the cell grows in size. When chromosomal replication is complete, the plasma membrane grows inward to divide the cell in two as a new cell wall is deposited between the daughter cells. The example shown here is the bacterium Escherichia coli.

While the bacterial chromosome is replicating, the cell is growing. When replication is complete and the bacterium has reached about twice its initial size, its plasma membrane grows inward, dividing the parent cell into two daughter cells. Each cell inherits a complete genome.

As eukaryotes evolved, along with their larger genomes and nuclear envelopes, the ancestral process of binary fission somehow gave rise to mitosis. FIGURE 12.11 traces a hypothesis for the stepwise evolution of mitosis. Possible intermediate stages are represented by two unusual types of nuclear division found in certain modern unicellular algae. In both types, the nuclear envelope remains intact. In dinoflagellates, replicated chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope and separate as it elongates prior to cell division. In diatoms, a spindle within the nucleus separates the chromosomes.

Fig 12-11. A hypothesis for the evolution of mitosis. Researchers interested in the evolution of eukaryotic cell division have observed in modern organisms what they believe are mechanisms of division intermediate between the binary fission of bacteria and mitosis as it occurs in most eukaryotes. These schematic diagrams of a proposed evolutionary sequence do not show cell walls.





 A molecular control system drives the cell cycle

What drives the cell cycle? One reasonable hypothesis might be that each event in the cycle triggers the next. According to this hypothesis, for example, the replication of chromosomes in the S phase might cause cell growth during G2, which might in turn directly trigger the onset of mitosis. However, this apparently logical hypothesis is not in fact correct.

In the early 1970s, a variety of experiments suggested an alternative hypothesis: that the cell cycle is driven by specific chemical signals present in the cytoplasm. Some of the first strong evidence for this hypothesis came from experiments with mammalian cells grown in culture (see FIGURE 12.15). In these experiments, two cells in different phases of the cell cycle were fused to form a single cell with two nuclei. If one of the original cells was in the S phase and the other was in G1, the G1 nucleus immediately entered the S phase, as though stimulated by chemicals present in the cytoplasm of the first cell. Similarly, if a cell undergoing mitosis (M phase) was fused with another cell in any stage of its cell cycle, even G1, the second nucleus immediately entered mitosis, with condensation of the chromatin and formation of a spindle (FIGURE 12.12).

Fig 12-15. The effect of a growth factor on cell division. This experiment confirms that platelet-derived growth factor, PDGF, stimulates the division of human fibroblast cells in culture. The basic growth medium is a complex mixture of glucose, amino acids, salts, and antibiotics (as a precaution against bacterial growth). Some culture vessels (controls) contain only this basic medium while others contain the basic medium plus PDGF.

Fig 12-12. Evidence for cytoplasmic chemical signals in cell cycle regulation. Cultured mammalian cells can be induced to fuse, forming a single cell with two nuclei. The results of fusing cells at two different phases of the cell cycle suggested that chemicals control the progression of phases. For example, when a cell in M phase was fused with a cell in any other phase, the second nucleus immediately began mitosis. If the second cell was in G1, as here, the condensed chromosomes that appeared had single chromatids.

These and other experiments demonstrated that the sequential events of the cell cycle are directed by a distinct cell cycle control system, a cyclically operating set of molecules in the cell that both triggers and coordinates key events in the cell cycle. The cell cycle control system has been compared to the control device of an automatic washing machine (FIGURE 12.13). Like the washer's device, the cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, driven by a built-in clock. However, just as a washer's cycle is subject to both external adjustment (such as faucets controlling the water supply) and internal control (such as the sensor that detects when the tub is filled with water), the cell cycle is regulated at certain checkpoints by both internal and external controls.

Fig 12-13. Mechanical analogy for the cell cycle control system. In this diagram of the cell cycle, the flat "stepping stones" around the perimeter represent sequential events. Like the control device of an automatic washer, the cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, driven by a built-in clock. However, the system is subject to regulation at various checkpoints, of which three are shown (red).

Cell Cycle Checkpoints

A checkpoint in the cell cycle is a critical control point where stop and go-ahead signals can regulate the cycle. (The signals are transmitted within the cell by the kinds of signal-transduction pathways discussed in Chapter 11.) Animal cells generally have built-in stop signals that halt the cell cycle at checkpoints until overridden by go-ahead signals. Many signals registered at checkpoints come from cellular surveillance mechanisms; the signals report whether crucial cellular processes up to that point have been completed correctly and thus whether or not the cell cycle should proceed. Checkpoints also register signals from outside the cell, as we will discuss later. Three major checkpoints are found in the G1, G2, and M phases.

For many cells, the G1 checkpoint--dubbed the "restriction point" in mammalian cells--seems to be the most important. If a cell receives a go-ahead signal at the G1 checkpoint, it will usually complete the cycle and divide. Alternatively, if it does not receive a go-ahead signal at that point, it will exit the cycle, switching into a nondividing state called the G0phase. Most cells of the human body are actually in the G0 phase. As mentioned earlier, highly specialized nerve and muscle cells never divide. Other cells, such as liver cells, can be "called back" to the cell cycle by certain environmental cues, such as growth factors released during injury.

To understand how cell cycle checkpoints work, we need to see what kinds of molecules make up the cell cycle control system.

The Cell Cycle Clock: Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases

Rhythmic fluctuations in the abundance and activity of cell cycle control molecules pace the sequential events of the cell cycle. These regulatory molecules are proteins of two main types. Some are protein kinases, enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating them (see Chapter 11). Particular protein kinases give the go-ahead signals at the G1 and G2 checkpoints.

The kinases that drive the cell cycle are actually present at a constant concentration in the growing cell, but much of the time they are in inactive form. To be active, such a kinase must be attached to a cyclin, a protein that gets its name from its cyclically fluctuating concentration in the cell. Because of this requirement, these kinases are called cyclin-dependent kinases, or Cdks. The activity of a Cdk rises and falls with changes in the concentration of its cyclin partner. FIGURE 12.14a shows the fluctuating activity of the cyclin-Cdk complex that was discovered first, called MPF. Note that the peaks of MPF activity correspond to the peaks of cyclin concentration. The cyclin level rises sharply throughout interphase (G1, S, and G2), then falls abruptly during mitosis (M).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 12-14. Molecular control of the cell cycle at the G2 checkpoint. The steps of the cell cycle are timed by rhythmic fluctuations in the activity of a special class of protein kinases. These enzymes are called cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) because they are active only when bound to a cyclin, a protein whose concentration varies cyclically. Here we focus on a Cdk-cyclin complex called MPF, which acts at the G2 checkpoint to trigger mitosis.

The initials MPF stand for "maturation-promoting factor," but we can think of MPF as "M-phase-promoting factor" because it triggers the cell's passage past the G2 checkpoint into M phase (FIGURE 12.14b). When cyclins that accumulate during G2 associate with Cdk molecules, the resulting MPF complex initiates mitosis, apparently by phosphorylating a variety of proteins. MPF acts both directly and indirectly. For example, it causes the nuclear envelope to fragment by phosphorylating--and stimulating still other kinases to phosphory late--proteins of the nuclear lamina, the lining of the nuclear envelope (see FIGURE 7.9).

Later in the M phase, MPF helps switch itself off by initiating a process that leads to the destruction of its cyclin by a special protein breakdown mechanism you will learn about later (see FIGURE 19.11). Protein breakdown is also involved in driving the cell cycle past the M phase checkpoint, which controls the onset of anaphase. The noncyclin part of MPF, the Cdk, persists in the cell in inactive form until it associates with new cyclin molecules synthesized during interphase of the next round of the cycle.

What about the G1 checkpoint? Recent research suggests the involvement of at least three Cdk proteins and several cyclins at this checkpoint. The fluctuating activities of different cyclin-Cdk complexes seem to control all the stages of the cell cycle.





 Internal and external cues help regulate the cell cycle

Research scientists are only in the early stages of working out the signaling pathways that link cyclin-dependent kinases to other molecules and events inside and outside the cell. For example, they know that active Cdks function by phosphorylating substrate proteins that affect particular steps in the cell cycle. But identifying the specific substrates of the various Cdks that become active at different phases of the cell cycle has proved difficult. In other words, scientists don't yet know what Cdks actually do in most cases. However, they have identified some steps of the signaling pathways that convey information to the cell cycle machinery. We'll next discuss two examples of such signaling, one originating inside the cell and one outside.

Internal Signals: Messages from the Kinetochores

Anaphase, the separation of sister chromatids, does not begin until all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle at the metaphase plate. The gatekeeper is the M phase checkpoint, and it ensures that daughter cells do not end up with missing or extra chromosomes. Researchers have learned that a signal that delays anaphase originates at kinetochores that are not yet attached to spindle microtubules. Certain associated proteins trigger a signaling pathway that keeps an anaphase-promoting complex (APC) in an inactive state. Only when all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle does this "wait" signal cease. The APC then becomes active and indirectly triggers both the breakdown of cyclin and the inactivation of proteins holding the sister chromatids together.

External Signals: Growth Factors

By growing animal cells in culture, researchers have been able to identify many external factors, both chemical and physical, that can influence cell division. For example, cells fail to divide if an essential nutrient is left out of the culture medium. And even if all other conditions are favorable, most types of mammalian cells divide in culture only if the growth medium includes specific growth factors. As mentioned in Chapter 11, a growth factor is a protein released by certain body cells that stimulates other cells to divide.

One example of a growth factor is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is made by blood cells called platelets. The experiment illustrated in FIGURE 12.15, p. 228, demonstrates that PDGF is required for the division of fibroblasts in culture. Fibroblasts, a type of connective tissue cell, have PDGF receptors on their plasma membranes. The binding of PDGF molecules to these receptors (which are tyrosine-kinase receptors; see Chapter 11) triggers a signal-transduction pathway that leads to stimulation of cell division. Presumably, the pathway activates one or more components of the cell cycle control system.

PDGF stimulates fibroblast division not only in the artificial conditions of cell culture, but in an animal's body as well. When an injury occurs, platelets release PDGF in the vicinity. The resulting proliferation of fibroblasts helps heal the wound. Researchers have discovered a number of different growth factors. Each cell type probably responds specifically to a certain growth factor or combination of growth factors.

The discovery of growth factors provided the key to understanding density-dependent inhibition of cell division, a phenomenon in which crowded cells stop dividing (FIGURE 12.16a). As first observed many years ago, cultured cells normally divide until they form a single layer of cells on the inner surface of the culture container, at which point the cells stop dividing. If some cells are removed, those bordering the open space begin dividing again and continue until the vacancy is filled. Apparently, when a cell population reaches a certain density, the amount of required growth factors and nutrients available to each cell becomes insufficient to allow continued cell growth.

Fig 12-16. Density-dependent inhibition of cell division. Individual cells are shown disproportionately large.

Most animal cells also exhibit anchorage dependence. To divide, they must be attached to a substratum, such as the inside of a culture jar or the extracellular matrix of a tissue. Experiments suggest that anchorage is signaled to the cell cycle control system via pathways involving plasma membrane proteins and elements of the cytoskeleton linked to them. Density-dependent inhibition and anchorage dependence probably function in the body's tissues as well as in cell culture, checking the growth of cells at some optimal density and location. Cancer cells, which we discuss next, exhibit neither density-dependent inhibition nor anchorage dependence (FIGURE 12.16b).





 Cancer cells have escaped from cell cycle controls

Cancer cells do not respond normally to the body's control mechanisms. They divide excessively and invade other tissues. If unchecked, they can kill the organism.

By studying cells growing in culture, researchers have learned that cancer cells do not heed the normal signals that regulate the cell cycle. For example, as FIGURE 12.16b shows, cancer cells do not exhibit density-dependent inhibition when growing in culture; they do not stop dividing when growth factors are depleted. A logical hypothesis to explain this behavior is that cancer cells do not need growth factors in their culture medium in order to grow and divide. They may make a required growth factor themselves or have an abnormality in the signaling pathway that conveys the growth factor's signal to the cell cycle control system--or the cell cycle control system itself may be abnormal. In fact, as you will learn in Chapter 19, these are all possible explanations.

There are other important differences between normal cells and cancer cells that reflect derangements of the cell cycle. If and when they stop dividing, cancer cells do so at random points in the cycle, rather than at the normal checkpoints. Moreover, in culture, cancer cells can go on dividing indefinitely if they are given a continual supply of nutrients; they are said to be "immortal." A striking example is a cell line that has been reproducing in culture since 1951. Cells of this line are called HeLa cells because their original source was from a tumor removed from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. By contrast, nearly all normal mammalian cells growing in culture divide only about 20 to 50 times before they stop dividing, age, and die. (We'll see a possible reason for this phenomenon when we discuss chromosome replication in Chapter 16.)

The abnormal behavior of cancer cells can be catastrophic when it occurs in the body. The problem begins when a single cell in a tissue undergoes transformation, the process that converts a normal cell to a cancer cell. The body's immune system normally recognizes a transformed cell as an insurgent and destroys it. However, if the cell evades destruction, it may proliferate to form a tumor, a mass of abnormal cells within otherwise normal tissue. If the abnormal cells remain at the original site, the lump is called a benign tumor. Most benign tumors do not cause serious problems and can be completely removed by surgery. In contrast, a malignant tumor becomes invasive enough to impair the functions of one or more organs (FIGURE 12.17). An individual with a malignant tumor is said to have cancer.

Fig 12-17. The growth and metastasis of a malignant breast tumor. The cells of malignant (cancerous) tumors grow in an uncontrolled way and can spread to neighboring tissues and, via the circulatory system, to other parts of the body. The spread of cancer cells beyond their original site is called metastasis.

The cells of malignant tumors are abnormal in many ways besides their excessive proliferation. They may have unusual numbers of chromosomes. Their metabolism may be deranged, and they cease to function in any constructive way. Also, owing to abnormal changes on the cells' surfaces, they lose their attachments to neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix and can spread into nearby tissues. Cancer cells may also separate from the original tumor, enter the blood and lymph vessels of the circulatory system, and invade other parts of the body, where they proliferate to form more tumors. This spread of cancer cells to locations distant from their original site is called metastasis (see FIGURE 12.17). If a tumor metastasizes, treatments may include high-energy radiation and chemotherapy with toxic drugs that are especially harmful to actively dividing cells.

Researchers are beginning to understand how a normal cell is transformed into a cancer cell. Though the causes of cancer are diverse, cellular transformation always involves the alteration of genes that somehow influence the cell cycle control system. Our knowledge of how changes in the genome lead to the various abnormalities of cancer cells remains rudimentary, however.

Perhaps the reason we have so many unanswered questions about cancer cells is that there is still so much to learn about how normal cells function. The cell, life's basic unit of structure and function, holds enough secrets to engage researchers well into the future.

Living organisms are distinguished by their ability to reproduce their kind. Like begets like. Only oak trees produce oaks, and only elephants can make more elephants. Furthermore, offspring resemble their parents more than they do less closely related individuals of the same species. The transmission of traits from one generation to the next is called inheritance, or heredity (from the Latin heres, heir). Along with inherited similarity, there is also variation: Offspring differ somewhat in appearance from parents and siblings. These observations have been exploited for the thousands of years that people have bred plants and animals. Curiosity about human similarities and differences is just as ancient. The photo on this page illustrates similarities and differences in Gwyneth Paltrow's family. The mechanisms of heredity and variation, however, eluded biologists until the development of genetics in the twentieth century.

Genetics, the scientific study of heredity and hereditary variation, is the subject of this unit. Here you will learn about genetics at the levels of organism, cell, and molecule. You will find out how geneticists are helping answer age-old questions about life, including the mystery of how multicellular animals and plants arise from a single cell, the fertilized egg. And you will learn that genetic methods and discoveries are catalyzing progress in every other biological field, including physiology, evolutionary biology, ecology, and even behavior. On the practical side, you will learn how modern genetics is revolutionizing medicine and agriculture. Finally, you will consider some social and ethical questions raised by our ability to manipulate DNA, the genetic material. In this chapter, we begin our study of genetics by examining how chromosomes pass from parents to offspring in sexual reproduction.

ORIGINS OF GENETIC VARIATION

 

 Sexual life cycles produce genetic variation among offspring



 

 Evolutionary adaptation depends on a population's genetic variation



How do we account for the genetic variation we observed in FIGURE 13.2? We are now ready to address this question.





 Offspring acquire genes from parents by inheriting chromosomes

Family friends may tell you that you have your mother's freckles, even though she still has hers. Parents do not, in any literal sense, give their children freckles, eyes, hair, or any other traits. What, then, actually is inherited? Parents endow their offspring with coded information in the form of hereditary units called genes. The tens of thousands of genes we inherit from our mothers and fathers constitute our genome. Our genetic link to our parents accounts for family resemblance. Your genome may include a gene for freckles, which you inherited from your mother. Our genes program the specific traits that emerge as we develop from fertilized eggs into adults.

Genes are segments of DNA. You learned in Chapters 1 and 5 that DNA is a polymer of four different kinds of monomers called nucleotides. Inherited information is passed on in the form of each gene's specific sequence of nucleotides, much as printed information is communicated in the form of meaningful sequences of letters. Language is symbolic. The brain translates words and sentences into mental images and ideas; for example, the object you imagine when you read "apple" looks nothing like the word itself. Analogously, cells translate genetic "sentences" into freckles and other features with no resemblance to genes. Most genes program cells to synthesize specific enzymes and other proteins, and it is the cumulative action of these proteins that produces an organism's inherited traits. The programming of these traits in the form of DNA is one of the unifying themes of biology.

The transmission of hereditary traits has its molecular basis in the precise replication of DNA, which produces copies of genes that can be passed along from parents to offspring. In animals and plants, the cellular vehicles that transmit genes from one generation to the next are sperm and ova (unfertilized eggs). After a sperm cell unites with an ovum (a single egg), genes from both parents are present in the nucleus of the fertilized egg.

Except for tiny amounts of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts, the DNA of a eukaryotic cell is subdivided into chromosomes within the nucleus. Every living species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. For example, humans have 46 chromosomes in almost all of their cells. Each chromosome consists of a single long DNA molecule elaborately coiled in association with various proteins. One chromosome includes hundreds or thousands of genes, each of which is a specific part of the DNA molecule. A gene's specific location along the length of a chromosome is called the gene's locus (plural, loci). Our genetic endowment consists of whatever genes happened to be part of the chromosomes we inherited from our parents.





 Like begets like, more or less: a comparison of asexual and sexual reproduction

Strictly speaking, "Like begets like" applies only to organisms that reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single individual is the sole parent and passes copies of all its genes to its offspring. For example, single-celled eukaryotic organisms can reproduce asexually by mitotic cell division, in which DNA is copied and allocated equally to two daughter cells. The genomes of the offspring are virtually exact copies of the parent's genome. Some multicellular organisms are also capable of reproducing asexually. Hydra, a relative of the jellyfishes, can reproduce by budding (FIGURE 13.1). Because the cells of the bud were derived by mitosis in the parent, the "chip off the old block" is usually genetically identical to its parent. Occasional genetic differences are due to relatively rare changes in the DNA called mutations, which we will discuss in Chapter 17. An individual that reproduces asexually gives rise to a clone, a group of genetically identical individuals.

Fig 13-1. The asexual reproduction of a hydra. This relatively simple multicellular animal reproduces by budding. The bud, a localized mass of mitotically dividing cells, develops into a small hydra, which detaches from the parent (LM).

Sexual reproduction results in greater variation than does asexual reproduction; two parents give rise to offspring that have unique combinations of genes inherited from the two parents. In contrast to a clone, offspring of sexual reproduction vary genetically from their siblings and both parents: "Like begets like" only in the general sense of family resemblance. Genetic variation like that shown in FIGURE 13.2 (p. 236) is an important consequence of sexual reproduction. What mechanisms generate this genetic variation? The key is the behavior of chromosomes during the sexual life cycle.

 Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles

We begin with a familiar example--the human life cycle--and use it to introduce some basic terms.

The Human Life Cycle

In humans, each somatic cell--any cell other than a sperm or ovum--has 46 chromosomes. With a light microscope, condensed (mitotic) chromosomes can be distinguished from one another by their appearance. The sizes of chromosomes and the positions of their centromeres differ. When chromosomes are stained with certain dyes, each chromosome also has a distinctive pattern of colored bands.

Careful examination of a micrograph of the 46 human chromosomes reveals that there are two of each type. This becomes clear when images of the chromosomes are arranged in pairs, starting with the longest chromosomes. The resulting display is called a karyotype (FIGURE 13.3). The chromosomes that make up a pair--that have the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern--are called homologous chromosomes, or homologues. The two chromosomes of each pair carry genes controlling the same inherited characters. For example, if a gene for eye color is situated at a particular locus on a certain chromosome, then the homologue of that chromosome will also have a gene specifying eye color at the equivalent locus.

Fig 13-3. Preparation of a human karyotype. Karyotypes, ordered displays of an individual's chromosomes, are often prepared using lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. The cells are treated with a drug to stimulate mitosis and are then grown in culture for several days. Another drug is then added to arrest mitosis at metaphase, when the chromosomes, each consisting of two joined sister chromatids, are highly condensed and easy to identify in the microscope. The figure above outlines the further steps in the preparation of the karyotype. Karyotyping can be used to screen for abnormal numbers of chromosomes or defective chromosomes associated with certain congenital disorders, such as Down syndrome. (The causes and effects of chromosomal disorders are discussed in Chapter 15.)

There is an important exception to the rule of homologous chromosomes for human somatic cells: the two distinct chromosomes referred to as X and Y. Human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes (XX), but males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Only small parts of the X and Y are homologous; most of the genes carried on the X chromosome do not have counterparts on the tiny Y, and the Y has genes lacking on the X. Because they determine an individual's sex, the X and Y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes. The other chromosomes are called autosomes.

The occurrence of homologous pairs of chromosomes in our karyotype is a consequence of our sexual origins. We inherit one chromosome of each pair from each parent. So the 46 chromosomes in our somatic cells are actually two sets of 23 chromosomes--a maternal set (from our mother) and a paternal set (from our father).

Sperm cells and ova are different from somatic cells in chromosome count. Each of these reproductive cells, or gametes, has a single set of the 22 autosomes plus a single sex chromosome, either X or Y. A cell with a single chromosome set is called a haploid cell. For humans, the haploid number, abbreviated n, is 23 (n = 23).

By means of sexual intercourse, a haploid sperm cell from the father reaches and fuses with a haploid ovum of the mother. This union of gametes is called fertilization, or syngamy. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, contains the two haploid sets of chromosomes bearing genes representing the maternal and paternal family lines. The zygote and all other cells having two sets of chromosomes are called diploid cells. For humans, the diploid number of chromosomes, abbreviated 2n, is 46 (2n = 46).

As a human develops from a zygote to a sexually mature adult, the zygote's genes are passed on with precision to all somatic cells of the body by the process of mitosis. Thus, somatic cells, like the zygote from which they are derived, are diploid.

The only cells of the human body not produced by mitosis are the gametes, which develop in the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). Imagine what would happen if human gametes were made by mitosis: They would be diploid like the somatic cells. At the next round of fertilization, when two gametes fused, the normal chromosome number of 46 would double to 92, and each subsequent generation would double the number of chromosomes yet again. But sexually reproducing organisms carry out a process that halves the chromosome number in the gametes, compensating for the doubling that occurs at fertilization. This process is a form of cell division called meiosis, and in animals it occurs only in the ovaries or testes. While mitosis conserves chromosome number, meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. As a result, human sperm and ova each have a haploid set of 23 different chromosomes, one from each homologous pair. Fertilization restores the diploid condition by combining two haploid sets of chromosomes, and the human life cycle is repeated, generation after generation (FIGURE 13.4).

Fig 13-4. The human life cycle. In each generation, the doubling of chromosome number that results from fertilization is offset by the halving of chromosome number that results from meiosis. For humans, the number of chromosomes in a haploid cell is 23 (n = 23); the number of chromosomes in the diploid zygote and all somatic cells arising from it is 46 (2n = 46).

In general outline, the human life cycle is typical of many animals. Indeed, the processes of fertilization and meiosis are the unique trademarks of sexual reproduction. Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles, offsetting each other's effects on the chromosome number and thus perpetuating a species' chromosome count.

The Variety of Sexual Life Cycles

Although the alternation of meiosis and fertilization is common to all organisms that reproduce sexually, the timing of these two events in the life cycle varies, depending on the species. These variations can be grouped into three main types of life cycles (FIGURE 13.5). The human life cycle is an example of one type, characteristic of most animals. Gametes are the only haploid cells. Meiosis occurs during the production of gametes, which undergo no further cell division prior to fertilization. The diploid zygote divides by mitosis, producing a multicellular organism that is diploid (FIGURE 13.5a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 13-5. Three sexual life cycles differing in the timing of meiosis and fertilization (syngamy). The common feature of all three cycles is the alternation of these two key events, which contribute to genetic variation among offspring.

A second type of life cycle occurs in most fungi and some protists, including some algae. After gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, meiosis occurs before offspring develop. This meiosis produces not gametes but haploid cells that then divide by mitosis to give rise to a haploid multicellular adult organism. Subsequently, the haploid organism produces gametes by mitosis, rather than by meiosis. The only diploid stage is the zygote (FIGURE 13.5b). (Note that either haploid or diploid cells can divide by mitosis, depending on the type of life cycle. Only diploid cells, however, can undergo meiosis.)

Plants and some species of algae exhibit a third type of life cycle called alternation of generations. This type of life cycle includes both diploid and haploid multicellular stages. The multicellular diploid stage is called the sporophyte. Meiosis in the sporophyte produces haploid cells called spores. Unlike a gamete, a spore gives rise to a multicellular individual without fusing with another cell. A spore divides mitotically to generate a multicellular haploid stage called the gametophyte. The haploid gametophyte makes gametes by mitosis. Fertilization results in a diploid zygote, which develops into the next sporophyte generation. In this type of life cycle, therefore, the sporophyte and gametophyte generations take turns reproducing each other (FIGURE 13.5c).

Though the three types of sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis and fertilization, they share a fundamental result: Each cycle of chromosome halving and doubling contributes to genetic variation among offspring. A closer look at meiosis will reveal the sources of this variation.





 Meiosis reduces chromosome number from diploid to haploid: a closer look

Many of the steps of meiosis closely resemble corresponding steps in mitosis. Meiosis, like mitosis, is preceded by the replication of chromosomes. However, this single replication is followed by two consecutive cell divisions, called meiosis I and meiosis II. These divisions result in four daughter cells (rather than the two daughter cells of mitosis), each with only half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Study the overview of meiosis in FIGURE 13.6, and be sure you understand the difference between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids. The two chromosomes of a homologous pair are individual chromosomes that were inherited from different parents. Homologues appear alike in the microscope, but they have different versions of genes at some of their corresponding loci (for example, a gene for freckles on one chromosome and a gene for the absence of freckles at the same locus on the homologue).

Fig 13-6. Overview of meiosis: how meiosis reduces chromosome number. After the chromosomes replicate once, the diploid cell divides twice, yielding four haploid daughter cells. This overview tracks just one pair of homologous chromosomes, which for the sake of simplicity are drawn in the condensed state throughout (they would not normally be condensed during interphase). Homologues in this and later figures are colored red and blue to remind you that they carry different versions of some genes.

The behavior of the chromosomes is emphasized by the use of red and blue to differentiate the members of each homologous pair. For a discussion of the spindle and other features common to mitosis and meiosis, see Chapter 12.

Mitosis and Meiosis Compared

Now that you have followed chromosomes through meiosis in FIGURE 13.7, let's summarize the key differences between meiosis and mitosis. The chromosome number is reduced by half in meiosis but not in mitosis. The genetic consequences of this difference are important. Whereas mitosis produces daughter cells genetically identical to their parent cell and to each other, meiosis produces cells that differ genetically from their parent cell and from each other.

FIGURE 13.8 compares the key steps of mitosis and meiosis. Although meiosis involves two cell divisions, three events that are unique to meiosis all occur during the first of the divisions, meiosis I:

Fig 13-8. A comparison of mitosis and meiosis. (In this chapter, we consider prophase to include prometaphase.)

During prophase I of meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes pair with their homologues, a process called synapsis. For part of prophase I, a protein "zipper"--the synaptonemal complex--holds the homologous chromosomes tightly together all along their lengths. When the synaptonemal complex disappears in late prophase, the four closely associated chromatids of a homologous pair are visible in the light microscope as a tetrad. Also visible in the light microscope are X-shaped regions called chiasmata (singular, chiasma). They represent a crossing of nonsister chromatids, which are two chromatids belonging to separate but homologous chromosomes. Chiasmata are the physical manifestations of a genetic rearrangement called crossing over, discussed in the next section. Neither synapsis nor chiasma formation occurs during mitosis.

At metaphase I of meiosis, homologous pairs of chromosomes, rather than individual chromosomes, align on the metaphase plate.

At anaphase I of meiosis, sister chromatids do not separate, as they do in mitosis. Rather, the two sister chromatids of each chromosome remain attached and go to the same pole of the cell. Meiosis I separates homologous pairs of chromosomes, not sister chromatids of individual chromosomes.

The second meiotic division, meiosis II, separates sister chromatids and is virtually identical in mechanism to mitosis. However, since the chromosomes do not replicate between meiosis I and meiosis II, the final outcome of meiosis is a halving of the number of chromosomes per cell--a reduction from two haploid sets to one haploid set in each cell.





 Sexual life cycles produce genetic variation among offspring

In species that reproduce sexually, the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization is responsible for most of the variation that arises each generation. Let's examine three mechanisms that contribute to the genetic variation arising from sexual reproduction: independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over, and random fertilization.

Independent Assortment of Chromosomes

One way sexual reproduction generates genetic variation is shown in FIGURE 13.9, which features meiosis of a diploid cell with two homologous pairs of chromosomes. The red and blue colors distinguishing the maternal and paternal chromosomes of each homologous pair allow us to track individual chromosomes as meiosis proceeds and they are packaged in gametes. At metaphase I, the homologous pairs of chromosomes, each consisting of one maternal and one paternal chromosome, are situated on the metaphase plate. The orientations of the homologous pairs relative to the poles of the cell are random; there are two alternative possibilities for each pair. Thus, there is a fifty-fifty chance that a particular daughter cell of meiosis I will get the maternal chromosome of a certain homologous pair and a fifty-fifty chance that it will receive the paternal chromosome.

Fig 13-9. The results of alternative arrangements of two homologous chromosome pairs on the metaphase plate in meiosis I. In this figure we consider the consequences of meiosis in a hypothetical organism with a diploid chromosome number of 4 (2n = 4). The parental origins of the chromosomes are designated with different colors, blue for chromosomes inherited from one parent, red for chromosomes from the other parent. The positioning of each homologous pair of chromosomes at metaphase I is a matter of chance and determines which chromosomes will be packaged together in the haploid daughter cells.

Because each homologous pair of chromosomes is positioned independently of the other pairs at metaphase I--its orientation is as random as the flip of a coin--the first meiotic division results in independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes into daughter cells. Each gamete represents one outcome of all possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes. The number of combinations possible for gametes formed by meiosis starting with two homologous pairs of chromosomes (2n = 4, n = 2) is four, as shown in FIGURE 13.9. (Only two of the four combinations of gametes shown in the figure would result from meiosis of a single diploid cell, but starting with a large number of diploid cells, gametes of all four types would be produced in approximately equal numbers.) In the case of n = 3, eight combinations of chromosomes are possible for gametes. More generally, the number of combinations possible when chromosomes assort independently into gametes during meiosis is 2n, where n is the haploid number of the organism.

In the case of humans, the haploid number (n) in the formula is 23. Thus, the number of possible combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the resulting gametes is 223, or about 8 million. The variety of gametes is analogous to the different combinations of heads and tails possible for the simultaneous tossing of 23 coins. Thus, each gamete that a human produces contains one of roughly 8 million possible assortments of chromosomes inherited from that individual's mother and father.

Crossing Over

As a consequence of the independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis, each of us produces a collection of gametes differing greatly in their combinations of the chromosomes we inherited from our two parents. But from what you have learned so far, it would seem that each individual chromosome in a gamete would be exclusively maternal or paternal in origin; that is, it would consist of DNA derived from our mother or father, but not from both. In fact, this is not the case. The process called crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes, which combine genes inherited from our two parents (FIGURE 13.10).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 13-10. The results of crossing over during meiosis. During prophase of meiosis I, nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange corresponding segments. Following these chromosomes through meiosis, we can see that crossing over gives rise to recombinant chromosomes, individual chromosomes that have some combination of DNA originally derived from two different parents.

Recent research has revealed that crossing over begins very early in prophase I, as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths and before the synaptonemal complex forms between them. The pairing is precise, the homologues aligning with each other gene by gene. In crossing over, homologous portions of two nonsister chromatids trade places. (For humans, an average of two or three such crossover events occur per chromosome pair.) After the synaptonemal complex disappears, the locations where these genetic exchanges have occurred are visible as chiasmata.

At metaphase II, chromosomes that contain one or more recombinant chromatids can be oriented in two alternative, nonequivalent ways with respect to other chromosomes, because their sister chromatids are no longer identical twins. The independent assortment of these nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II increases still more the number of genetic types of gametes that can result from meiosis.

You will learn more about crossing over in Chapter 15. The important point for now is that crossing over, by combining DNA inherited from two parents into a single chromosome, is an important source of genetic variation in sexual life cycles.

Random Fertilization

The random nature of fertilization adds to the genetic variation arising from meiosis. Consider a zygote resulting from a mating between a woman and a man. A human ovum, representing one of approximately 8 million possible chromosome combinations, is fertilized by a single sperm cell, which represents one of 8 million different possibilities. Thus, even without considering crossing over, any two parents will produce a zygote with any of about 64 trillion (8 million &#160;X&#160; 8 million) diploid combinations. (If you calculate 223&#160;X&#160; 223 exactly, you will find that the total is actually over 70 trillion.) Adding in the variation brought about by crossing over, the number of possibilities is truly astronomical. No wonder brothers and sisters can be so different. You really are unique.

So far, we have seen that there are three sources of genetic variability in a sexually reproducing population of organisms:

Independent assortment of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I (and of nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II)

Crossing over between homologous chromosomes during prophase of meiosis I

Random fertilization of an ovum by a sperm

All three mechanisms reshuffle the various genes carried by the individual members of a population. However, as you will learn in subsequent chapters, mutations are what ultimately create a population's diversity of genes.





 Evolutionary adaptation depends on a population's genetic variation

Having considered how sexual reproduction contributes to genetic variation in a population, we can relate these concepts to evolution, biology's core theme. Darwin recognized the importance of genetic variation in the evolutionary mechanism he called natural selection. Recall from Chapter 1 that a population evolves through the differential reproductive success of its variant members. On average, those individuals best suited to the local environment leave the most offspring, transmitting their genes in the process. This natural selection results in adaptation, the accumulation of the genetic variations favored by the environment. As the environment changes or a population moves, the population may survive if, in each generation, at least some of its members can cope effectively with the new conditions. Different genetic variations may work better than those that prevailed in the old time or place. Sex and mutations are the two sources of this variation, and we have considered the sexual contribution in this chapter.

Although Darwin realized that heritable variation is what makes evolution possible, he could not explain why offspring resemble--but are not identical to--their parents. Ironically, Gregor Mendel, a contemporary of Darwin, published a theory of inheritance that helps explain genetic variation, but his discoveries had no impact on biologists until 1900, more than 15 years after Darwin (1809-1882) and Mendel (1822-1884) had died. In the next chapter, you will learn how Mendel discovered the basic rules governing the inheritance of specific traits.

Eyes of brown, blue, green, or gray; hair of black, brown, blond, or red--these are just a few examples of heritable variations that we may observe among individuals in a population. What genetic principles account for the transmission of such traits from parents to offspring?

One possible explanation of heredity is a "blending" hypothesis, the idea that genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes in a manner analogous to the way blue and yellow paints blend to make green. This hypothesis predicts that over many generations, a freely mating population will give rise to a uniform population of individuals. However, our everyday observations and the results of breeding experiments with animals and plants contradict such a prediction. The blending hypothesis also fails to explain other phenomena of inheritance, such as traits skipping a generation.

An alternative to the blending model is a "particulate" hypothesis of inheritance: the gene idea. According to this model, parents pass on discrete heritable units--genes--that retain their separate identities in offspring. An organism's collection of genes is more like a bucket of marbles than a pail of paint. Like marbles, genes can be sorted and passed along, generation after generation, in undiluted form.

Modern genetics had its genesis in an abbey garden, where a monk named Gregor Mendel documented a particulate mechanism of inheritance. In the painting on this page, Mendel works with his experimental organism, garden peas. Mendel developed his theory of inheritance several decades before the behavior of chromosomes was observed in the microscope and their significance understood. So in this chapter, we digress from the study of chromosomes to recount how Mendel arrived at his theory. We will also see how the Mendelian model applies to the inheritance of human variations.

Whereas peas are convenient subjects for genetic research, humans are not. The human generation span is about 20 years, and human parents produce relatively few offspring compared to peas and most other species. Furthermore, breeding experiments like the ones Mendel performed are unacceptable with humans. In spite of these difficulties, the study of human genetics continues to advance, powered by the incentive to understand our own inheritance. New techniques in molecular biology have led to many breakthrough discoveries, as we will see in Chapter 20, but basic Mendelism endures as the foundation of human genetics.

Mendel grew up on his parents' small farm in a region of Austria that is now part of the Czech Republic. At school in this agricultural area, Mendel and the other children received agricultural training along with basic education. Later, Mendel overcame financial hardship and illness to excel in high school and at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute.

In 1843, Mendel entered an Augustinian monastery. After three years of theological studies, he was assigned to a school as a temporary teacher but failed the teacher's examination. An administrator sent Mendel to the University of Vienna, where he studied from 1851 to 1853. These were very important years for Mendel's development as a scientist. Two professors were especially influential. One was the physicist Doppler, who encouraged his students to learn science through experimentation and trained Mendel to use mathematics to help explain natural phenomena. The second was a botanist named Unger, who aroused Mendel's interest in the causes of variation in plants. These influences came together in Mendel's subsequent experiments with garden peas.

After attending the university, Mendel was assigned to teach at the Br&uuml;nn Modern School, where several teachers shared his enthusiasm for scientific research. At the monastery where Mendel lived, he also found stimulating colleagues, many of them university professors and active researchers. Moreover, there had been a long tradition of interest in the breeding of plants, including peas, at the monastery. Thus, it was probably not extraordinary when, around 1857, Mendel began breeding garden peas in the abbey garden in order to study inheritance. What was extraordinary was Mendel's fresh approach to very old questions about heredity.

Mendel probably chose to work with peas because they are available in many varieties. For example, one variety has purple flowers, while another variety has white flowers. Geneticists use the term character for a heritable feature, such as flower color, that varies among individuals. Each variant for a character, such as purple or white color for flowers, is called a trait.

The use of peas also gave Mendel strict control over which plants mated with which. The sex organs of a pea plant are in its flowers, and each pea flower has both male and female organs--stamens and carpel, respectively. In nature, the plants usually self-fertilize: Pollen grains released from the stamens land on the carpel of the same flower, and sperm from the pollen fertilize ova in the carpel. To achieve cross-pollination (fertilization between different plants), Mendel removed the immature stamens of a plant before they produced pollen and then dusted pollen from another plant onto the emasculated flowers (FIGURE 14.1). Each resulting zygote then developed into a plant embryo encased in a seed (pea). Whether ensuring self-pollination or executing artificial cross-pollination, Mendel could always be sure of the parentage of new seeds.

Fig 14-1. A genetic cross. To mate (hybridize) two varieties of pea plants, Mendel used an artist's brush to transfer sperm-bearing pollen from one plant to the egg-bearing carpel of another. In this example, the character of interest is flower color. When pollen from a white flower fertilizes ova of a purple flower, the first-generation hybrids all have purple flowers. The result is the same for the reciprocal cross, the transfer of pollen from purple flowers to white flowers.

Mendel chose to track only those characters that varied in an "either-or" rather than a "more-or-less" manner. For example, his plants had either purple flowers or white flowers; there was nothing intermediate between these two varieties. Had Mendel focused instead on characters that vary in a continuum among individuals--seed weight, for example--he would not have discovered the particulate nature of inheritance.

Mendel also made sure he started his experiments with varieties that were true-breeding, which means that when the plants self-pollinate, all their offspring are of the same variety. For example, a plant with purple flowers is true-breeding if the seeds produced by self-pollination all give rise to plants that also have purple flowers.

In a typical breeding experiment, Mendel would cross-pollinate two contrasting, true-breeding pea varieties--for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants (see FIGURE 14.1). This mating, or crossing, of two true-breeding varieties is called hybridization. The true-breeding parents are referred to as the P generation (parental generation), and their hybrid offspring are the F1 generation (first filial generation, the word filial from the Latin word for "son"). Allowing these F1 hybrids to self-pollinate produces an F2 generation (second filial generation). Mendel usually followed traits for at least these three generations: the P, F1, and F2 generations. Had Mendel stopped his experiments with the F1 generation, the basic patterns of inheritance would have eluded him. It was mainly Mendel's quantitative analysis of F2 plants that revealed the two fundamental principles of heredity that are now known as the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment.





 By the law of segregation, the two alleles for a character are packaged into separate gametes

If the blending model of inheritance were correct, the F1 hybrids from a cross between purple-flowered and white-flowered pea plants would have pale purple flowers, intermediate between the two varieties of the P generation. Notice in FIGURE 14.1 that the experiment produced a very different result: The F1 offspring all had flowers just as purple as the purple-flowered parents. What happened to the white-flowered plants' genetic contribution to the hybrids? If it were lost, then the F1 plants could produce only purple-flowered offspring in the F2 generation. But when Mendel allowed the F1 plants to self-pollinate and planted their seeds, the white-flower trait reappeared in the F2 generation. Mendel used very large sample sizes and kept accurate records of his results: 705 of the F2 plants had purple flowers, and 224 had white flowers. These data fit a ratio of about three purple to one white (FIGURE 14.2). Mendel reasoned that the heritable factor for white flowers did not disappear in the F1 plants, but only the purple-flower factor was affecting flower color in these hybrids. In Mendel's terminology, purple flower is a dominant trait and white flower is a recessive trait. The occurrence of white-flowered plants in the F2 generation was evidence that the heritable factor causing that recessive trait had not been diluted in any way by coexisting with the purple-flower factor in the F1 hybrids.

Fig 14-2. Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. When F1 hybrids were allowed to self-pollinate, or when they were cross-pollinated with other F1 hybrids, a 3:1 ratio of the two varieties occurred in the F2 generation. A genetic cross, or mating, is symbolized by &#160;X&#160;.

Mendel observed the same pattern of inheritance in six other characters, each represented by two different varieties (TABLE 14.1, p. 250). For example, the parental pea seeds either had a smooth, round shape or were wrinkled. When Mendel crossed his two true-breeding varieties, all the F1 hybrids produced round seeds; this is the dominant trait. In the F2 generation, 75%  of the seeds were round and 25%  were wrinkled--a 3:1 ratio, as in FIGURE 14.2. How did Mendel explain this pattern, which he consistently observed in his crosses? He developed a hypothesis that we can break down into four related ideas. (We will replace some of Mendel's original terms with modern words; for example, "gene" will be used in place of Mendel's "heritable factor.")

787:2772.84:1Alternative versions of genes (different alleles) account for variations in inherited characters. The gene for flower color, for example, exists in two versions, one for purple flowers and the other for white. These alternative versions of a gene are now called alleles (FIGURE 14.3). Today, we can relate this concept to chromosomes and DNA. As we mentioned in Chapter 13, each gene resides at a specific locus on a specific chromosome. The DNA at that locus, however, can vary somewhat in its sequence of nucleotides and hence in its information content. The purple-flower allele and the white-flower allele are two DNA variations possible at the flower-color locus on one of a pea plant's chromosomes.

Fig 14-3. Alleles, alternative versions of a gene. The gene for a particular inherited character, such as flower color in garden peas, resides at a specific locus (position) on a certain chromosome. Alleles are variants of that gene. In the case of peas, the flower-color gene exists in two versions: the allele for purple flowers and the allele for white flowers. This homologous pair of chromosomes represents an F1 hybrid, which inherited the allele for purple flowers from one parent and the allele for white flowers from the other parent.

For each character, an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. Mendel made this deduction without knowing about the role of chromosomes, but what you learned about chromosomes in Chapter 13 will help you understand Mendel's idea. Recall that a diploid organism has homologous pairs of chromosomes, one chromosome of each pair inherited from each parent. Thus, a genetic locus is actually represented twice in a diploid cell. These homologous loci may have identical alleles, as in the true-breeding plants of Mendel's P generation. Or the two alleles may differ, as in the F1 hybrids. In the flower-color example, the hybrids inherited a purple-flower allele from one parent and a white-flower allele from the other parent (see FIGURE 14.3). This brings us to the third part of Mendel's hypothesis.

If the two alleles differ, then one, thedominant allele, is fully expressed in the organism's appearance; the other, therecessive allele, has no noticeable effect on the organism's appearance. According to this part of the hypothesis, Mendel's F1 plants had purple flowers because the allele for that variation is dominant and the allele for white flowers is recessive.

The two alleles for each character segregate (separate) during gamete production. Thus, an ovum and a sperm each get only one of the two alleles that are present in the somatic cells of the organism. In terms of chromosomes, this segregation corresponds to the distribution of homologous chromosomes to different gametes in meiosis. Note that if an organism has identical alleles for a particular character--that is, the organism is true-breeding for that character--then that allele exists in a single copy in all gametes. But if different alleles are present, as in the F1 hybrids, then 50%  of the gametes receive the dominant allele, while 50%  receive the recessive allele. It is this last part of the hypothesis, the separation of alleles into separate gametes, for which Mendel's law of segregation is named.

One test of Mendel's segregation hypothesis is whether or not it can account for the 3:1 ratio he observed in the F2 generation of his numerous crosses. The hypothesis predicts that the F1 hybrids will produce two classes of gametes. When alleles segregate, half the gametes receive a purple-flower allele, while the other half get a white-flower allele. During self-pollination, the gametes of these two classes unite randomly. An ovum with a purple-flower allele has an equal chance of being fertilized by a sperm with a purple-flower allele or one with a white-flower allele. Since the same is true for an ovum with a white-flower allele, there are a total of four equally likely combinations of sperm and ovum. FIGURE 14.4 illustrates these combinations using a type of diagram called a Punnett square, a handy device for predicting the results of a genetic cross between individuals of known genotype. Notice that we use a capital letter to symbolize a dominant allele and a lowercase letter for a recessive allele. In our example, P is the purple-flower allele, and p is the white-flower allele.

Fig 14-4. Mendel's law of segregation. A genetically specific version of FIGURE 14.2, this diagram illustrates Mendel's model for the inheritance of the alleles of a single gene. The purple-flower allele (P) is dominant, and the white-flower allele (p) is recessive. Each plant has two alleles for the gene controlling flower color, one allele inherited from each parent.

What will be the physical appearance of these F2 offspring? One-fourth of the plants have two alleles specifying purple flowers; clearly, these plants will have purple flowers. But one-half of the F2 offspring have inherited one allele for purple flowers and one allele for white flowers; like the F1 plants, these plants will also have purple flowers, the dominant trait. Finally, one-fourth of the F2 plants have inherited two alleles specifying white flowers and will, in fact, express the recessive trait. Thus, Mendel's model accounts for the 3:1 ratio that he observed in the F2 generation.

Some Useful Genetic Vocabulary

An organism having a pair of identical alleles for a character is said to be homozygous for the gene controlling that character. A pea plant that is true-breeding for purple flowers (PP) is an example. Pea plants with white flowers are also homozygous, but for the recessive allele (pp). If we cross dominant homozygotes with recessive homozygotes, as in the parental (P generation) cross of FIGURE 14.4, every offspring will have two different alleles--Pp in the case of the F1 hybrids of our flower-color experiment. Organisms having two different alleles for a gene are said to be heterozygous for that gene. Unlike homozygotes, heterozygotes are not true-breeding, because they produce gametes having one or the other of the different alleles. We have seen that a Pp plant of the F1 generation will produce both purple-flowered and white-flowered offspring when it self-pollinates.

Because of dominance and recessiveness, an organism's traits do not always reveal its genetic composition. Therefore, we have to distinguish between an organism's traits, called its phenotype, and its genetic makeup, its genotype. In the case of flower color in peas, PP and Pp plants have the same phenotype (purple) but different genotypes. FIGURE 14.5 reviews these terms. Note that phenotype refers to physiological traits as well as traits relating directly to appearance. For example, there is a pea variety that lacks the normal trait of being able to self-pollinate. This physiological variation is a phenotype.

Fig 14-5. Genotype versus phenotype. Grouping F2 offspring from a cross for flower color according to phenotype results in the typical 3:1 ratio. In terms of genotype, however, there are actually two categories of purple-flowered plants: PP (homozygous) and Pp (heterozygous).

The Testcross

Suppose we have a pea plant that has purple flowers. We cannot tell from its flower color if this plant is homozygous or heterozygous because the genotypes PP and Pp result in the same phenotype. But if we cross this pea plant with one having white flowers, the appearance of the offspring will reveal the genotype of the purple-flowered parent (FIGURE 14.6). The genotype of the plant with white flowers is known: Because this is the recessive trait, the plant must be homozygous (pp). If all the offspring of the cross have purple flowers, then the other parent must be homozygous for the dominant allele; a PP&#160;X&#160;pp cross produces nothing but Pp offspring. But if both the purple and the white phenotypes appear among the offspring, then the purple-flowered parent must be heterozygous. The offspring of a Pp&#160;X&#160;pp cross will have a 1:1 phenotypic ratio. This breeding of a recessive homozygote with an organism of dominant phenotype but unknown genotype is called a testcross. It was devised by Mendel and continues to be an important tool of geneticists.

Fig 14-6. A testcross. A testcross is designed to reveal the genotype of an organism that exhibits a dominant trait, such as purple flowers in pea plants. Such an organism could be either homozygous for the dominant allele or heterozygous. The most efficient way to determine the genotype is to cross the organism with an individual expressing the recessive trait. Since the white-flowered parent must be homozygous, we can deduce the genotype of the purple-flowered parent by observing the phenotypes of the offspring.





 By the law of independent assortment, each pair of alleles segregates into gametes independently

Gregor Mendel derived the law of segregation by performing breeding experiments in which he followed only a single character, such as flower color. The F1 hybrids produced in such crosses are called monohybrids. What would happen if he followed two characters at the same time? For instance, two of the seven characters Mendel studied were seed color and seed shape. Seeds may be either yellow or green. They also may be either round (smooth) or wrinkled. From single-character crosses, Mendel knew that the allele for yellow seeds is dominant (Y) and that the allele for green seeds is recessive (y). For the seed-shape character, the allele for round is dominant (R), and the allele for wrinkled is recessive (r). Imagine crossing two true-breeding pea varieties differing in both of these characters--a parental cross between a plant with yellow-round seeds (YYRR) and a plant with green-wrinkled seeds (yyrr). The F1 plants will be dihybrids, heterozygous for both characters (YyRr). But are these two characters, seed color and seed shape, transmitted from parents to offspring as a package? Put another way, will the Y and R alleles always stay together, generation after generation? Or are seed color and seed shape inherited independently of each other? FIGURE 14.7 illustrates how a dihybrid cross, a cross between F1 dihybrids, can determine which of these two hypotheses is correct.

Fig 14-7. Testing two hypotheses for segregation in a dihybrid cross. A cross between true-breeding parent plants that differ in two characters produces F1 plants that are dihybrids: They are heterozygous for both characters. The F2 phenotypes show that the characters assort (segregate) independently. In this example, the two characters are seed color and seed shape. Yellow color (Y) and round shape (R) are dominant.

The F1 plants, of genotype YyRr, exhibit both dominant phenotypes, yellow seeds with round shapes, no matter which hypothesis is correct. The key step in the experiment is to see what happens when F1 plants self-pollinate to produce F2 offspring. If the hybrids must transmit their alleles in the same combinations in which they were inherited from the P generation, then there will only be two classes of gametes: YR and yr. This hypothesis predicts that the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 3:1, just as in a cross between monohybrids (see FIGURE 14.7a).

The alternative hypothesis is that the two pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other. In other words, genes are packaged into gametes in all possible allelic combinations, as long as each gamete has one allele for each gene. In our example, four classes of gametes would be produced in equal quantities: YR, Yr, yR, and yr. If sperm of four classes are mixed with ova of four classes, there will be 16 (4 &#160;X&#160; 4) equally probable ways in which the alleles can combine in the F2 generation, as shown in FIGURE 14.7b. These combinations make up four phenotypic categories with a ratio of 9:3:3:1 (nine yellow-round to three green-round to three yellow-wrinkled to one green-wrinkled). When Mendel did the experiment and "scored" (classified) the F2 offspring, he obtained a ratio of 315:108:101:32, which is approximately 9:3:3:1.

The experimental results supported the hypothesis that each character is independently inherited--that in the dihybrids (YyRr), the two alleles for seed color segregate independently of the two alleles for seed shape. Mendel tried his seven pea characters in various dihybrid combinations and always observed a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Notice in FIGURE 14.7b, however, that, if you consider the two characters separately, there is a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each: three yellow to one green; three round to one wrinkled. As far as a single character is concerned, the alleles segregate as if this were a monohybrid cross. The independent segregation of each pair of alleles during gamete formation is now called Mendel's law of independent assortment.





 Mendelian inheritance reflects rules of probability

Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability that apply to tossing coins or rolling dice. A basic understanding of these rules of chance is essential for genetic analysis.

The probability scale ranges from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1, while an event that is certain not to occur has a probability of 0. With a two-headed coin, the probability of tossing heads is 1, and the probability of tossing tails is 0. With a normal coin, the chance of tossing heads is 1/2, and the chance of tossing tails is 1/2. The probability of rolling the number 3 with a die, which is six-sided, is 1/6. The probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event must add up to 1. With a die, the chance of rolling a number other than 3 is 5/6.

We can learn an important lesson about probability from tossing a coin. For every toss, the probability of heads is 1/2. The outcome of any particular toss is unaffected by what has happened on previous trials. We refer to phenomena such as successive coin tosses, or simultaneous tosses of several coins, as independent events. The question of whether a tossed coin will come up heads or tails is analogous to the question of whether a gamete produced by a Pp heterozygote will carry allele P or allele p (FIGURE 14.8). In every fertilization involving such gametes, the ovum has a 1/2 chance of carrying the dominant allele and a 1/2 chance of carrying the recessive allele. The same odds apply to the sperm cell. Like two separate coin tosses, allele segregation during formation of the sperm and ovum occurs as two independent events.

Fig 14-8. Segregation of alleles and fertilization as chance events. When a heterozygote (Pp) forms gametes, segregation of alleles is like the toss of a coin. We can determine the probability for any genotype among the offspring of two heterozygotes, as explained in the text.

We can use our understanding of independent events to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. Two basic laws of probability that can help us in games of chance and in solving genetic problems are the rule of multiplication and the rule of addition.

The Rule of Multiplication

What is the chance that two coins tossed simultaneously will land heads up? More generally, how do we determine the chance that two or more independent events will occur together in some specific combination? The solution is in computing the probability for each independent event, then multiplying these individual probabilities to obtain the overall probability of these events occurring together. By this rule of multiplication, the probability that both coins will land heads up is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4. An F1 monohybrid cross is analogous to this game of chance. With flower color in pea plants as the heritable character, the genotype of a given F1 plant is Pp. What is the probability that a particular F2 plant will have white flowers? For this to happen, both the ovum and the sperm must carry the p allele, so we invoke the rule of multiplication. Segregation in the heterozygous plant is like flipping a coin. The probability that an ovum will have the p allele is 1/2. The chance that a sperm will have the p allele is 1/2. Thus, the probability that two p alleles will come together at fertilization is 1/2 &#160;X&#160; 1/2 = 1/4, equivalent to the probability that two independently tossed coins will land heads up (see the Punnett square in FIGURE 14.8).

We can also apply the rule of multiplication to dihybrid crosses, such as the one shown in FIGURE 14.7b. For a parent with the genotype YyRr, the probability that a gamete will carry the Y and R alleles is 1/4. We can use the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of specific genotypes in the F2 generation without having to construct a 16-part Punnett square. For example, the probability of an F2 plant having the genotype YYRR is 1/16 (1/4 chance for a YR ovum &#160;X&#160; 1/4 chance for a YR sperm). This corresponds to the top box in the Punnett square of FIGURE 14.7b.

The Rule of Addition

What is the probability that an F2 plant from a monohybrid cross will be heterozygous? Notice in FIGURE 14.8 that there are two ways F1 gametes can combine to produce a heterozygous result. The dominant allele can come from the ovum and the recessive allele from the sperm, or vice versa. By the rule of addition, the probability of an event that can occur in two or more different ways is the sum of the separate probabilities of those ways. Using this rule, we can calculate the probability of an F2 heterozygote as 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

Using Rules of Probability to Solve Genetics Problems

We can combine the rules of multiplication and addition to solve complex problems in Mendelian genetics. For instance, imagine a cross of two pea varieties that differ in three characters--a trihybrid cross. Suppose we cross a trihybrid with purple flowers and yellow, round seeds (heterozygous for all three genes) with a plant with purple flowers and green, wrinkled seeds (heterozygous for flower color but homozygous recessive for the other two characters). Using Mendelian symbols, our cross is
PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr

Let's use the rules of probability to calculate the fraction of offspring predicted to exhibit the recessive phenotypes for atleast two of the three traits. We can start by listing all genotypes that fulfill this condition: ppyyRr, ppYyrr, Ppyyrr, PPyyrr, and ppyyrr. (Because the condition is at least two recessive traits, this last genotype, which produces all three recessive phenotypes, counts.) Next, we use the rule of multiplication to calculate the probability for each of these genotypes from our PpYyRr&#160;X&#160;Ppyyrr cross (that is, we multiply the individual probabilities for the allele pairs). Finally, we use the rule of addition to pool the probabilities for fulfilling the condition of at least two recessive traits as shown at the top of the next column.

ppyyRr&#188; (probability of PP) &#160;X&#160;&#189; (yy) &#160;X&#160; (Rr)= 1/16ppYyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16Ppyyrr&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 2/16PPyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16ppyyrr&#188;&#160;X&#160;&#189;&#160;X&#160;&#189;= 1/16 Chance of at least two recessive traits= 6/16 or 3/8With practice, you'll be able to apply the rules of probability to solve genetics problems faster than you could by filling in Punnett squares.





 Mendel discovered the particulate behavior of genes:

a review

If we plant a seed from the F2 generation of FIGURE 14.4, we cannot predict with certainty that the plant will yield white flowers, any more than we can predict with certainty that two tossed coins will both come up heads. What we cansay is that there is exactly a 1/4 chance that the plant will have white flowers. Stated another way, among a large sample of F2 plants, one-fourth (25% ) will have white flowers. Usually, the larger the sample size, the closer the results will conform to our predictions. The fact that Mendel counted so many offspring from his crosses suggests that he understood this statistical feature of inheritance and had a keen sense of the rules of chance.

Thus, Mendel's two laws, segregation and independent assortment, explain heritable variations in terms of alternative forms of genes (hereditary "particles") that are passed along, generation after generation, according to simple rules of probability. This particulate theory of inheritance, first discovered in garden peas, is equally valid for figs, flies, fish, birds, and human beings. Mendel's impact endures, not only on genetics, but on all of science, as a case study of the power of scientific reasoning (hypothetico-deductive reasoning; see Chapter 1).





 The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely simple

In the 20th century, geneticists have extended Mendelian principles not only to diverse organisms, but also to patterns of inheritance more complex than Mendel actually described. It was brilliant (or lucky) that Mendel chose pea plant characters that turned out to have a relatively simple genetic basis: Each character he studied is determined by one gene, for which there are only two alleles, one completely dominant to the other.* But these conditions are not met by all heritable characters, not even in garden peas. The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely so simple. This does not diminish the utility of Mendelian genetics, for the basic principles of segregation and independent assortment apply even to more complex patterns of inheritance. In this section, we will extend Mendelian genetics to hereditary patterns that were not reported by Mendel.

Incomplete Dominance

The F1 offspring of Mendel's classic pea crosses always looked like one of the two parental varieties because of the complete dominance of one allele over another. But for some genes, there is incomplete dominance, where the F1 hybrids have an appearance somewhere in between the phenotypes of the two parental varieties. For instance, when red snapdragons are crossed with white snapdragons, all the F1 hybrids have pink flowers (FIGURE 14.9). This third phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes having less red pigment than the red homozygotes (unlike the situation in Mendel's pea plants, where the Pp heterozygotes make enough pigment for the flowers to be a purple color indistinguishable from those of PP plants). We should not, however, regard incomplete dominance as evidence for the blending hypothesis, which would predict that the red or white traits could never be retrieved from the pink hybrids. In fact, breeding the F1 hybrids produces F2 offspring with a phenotypic ratio of one red to two pink to one white. (Because heterozygotes have a separate phenotype, the genotypic and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation are the same, 1:2:1.) The segregation of the red-flower and white-flower alleles in the gametes produced by the pink-flowered plants confirms that the alleles for flower color are heritable factors that maintain their identity in the hybrids; that is, inheritance is particulate.

Fig 14-9. Incomplete dominance in snapdragon color. When red snapdragons are crossed with white ones, the F1 hybrids have pink flowers. Segregation of alleles into gametes of the F1 plants results in an F2 generation with a 1:2:1 ratio for both genotype and phenotype. CR = allele for red flower color; CW = allele for white flower color.

What Is a Dominant Allele?

Now that you have learned about incomplete dominance, let's reexamine the meaning of dominance and recessiveness. What is a dominant allele? Or, more importantly, what is it not?

In complete dominance, the situation described by Mendel, the phenotypes of the heterozygote and dominant homozygote are indistinguishable. This represents one extreme of a spectrum in the dominance/recessiveness relationships of alleles. At the other extreme is codominance, in which the two alleles affect the phenotype in separate, distinguishable ways. One example is the existence of three different human blood groups called the M, N, and MN blood groups. These groupings are based on two specific molecules located on the surface of red blood cells. People of group M have one of these two types of molecules, and people of group N have the other type. Group MN is characterized by the presence of both molecules on red blood cells. What is the genetic basis of these phenotypes? A single gene locus, at which two allelic variations are possible, determines these blood groups. M individuals are homozygous for one allele; N individuals are homozygous for the other allele. A heterozygous condition results in the blood of the MN group.

Note that the MN phenotype is not intermediate between the M and N phenotypes; both the M and N phenotypes are individually expressed by the presence of the two types of molecules on red blood cells. In contrast, incomplete dominance is characterized by an intermediate phenotype, as in the pink flowers of snapdragon hybrids. Thus, the range of relative effects of two alleles includes complete dominance, codominance, and different degrees of incomplete dominance. These variations are reflected in the phenotypes of heterozygotes.

For any character, the dominance/recessiveness relationship we observe depends on the level at which we examine phenotype. For example, consider Tay-Sachs disease, an inherited disorder in humans. The brain cells of a baby with Tay-Sachs disease are unable to metabolize gangliosides, a type of lipid, because a crucial enzyme does not work properly. As the lipids accumulate in the brain, the brain cells gradually cease to function normally, leading to death. Only children who inherit two copies of the Tay-Sachs allele (homozygotes) have the disease. Thus, on the organismal level of normal versus Tay-Sachs phenotype, the Tay-Sachs allele qualifies as a recessive. At the biochemical level, however, we observe an intermediate phenotype characteristic of incomplete dominance: The enzyme deficiency that causes Tay-Sachs disease can be detected in heterozygotes, who have an activity level of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme that is intermediate between individuals homozygous for the normal allele and individuals with Tay-Sachs disease. Heterozygotes lack symptoms of the disease, apparently because half the normal amount of functional enzyme is sufficient to prevent lipid accumulation in the brain. In fact, heterozygous individuals produce equal numbers of normal and dysfunctional enzyme molecules. Thus, at the molecular level, the normal allele and the Tay-Sachs allele are codominant. As you can see, dominance/recessiveness relationships are rarely as straightforward as Mendel reported.

It is also important to understand that an allele is not termed dominant because it somehow subdues a recessive allele. Recall that alleles are simply variations in a gene's nucleotide sequence. When a dominant allele coexists with a recessive allele in a heterozygous genotype, they do not actually interact at all. It is in the pathway from genotype to phenotype that dominance and recessiveness come into play. We can use one of Mendel's characters--round versus wrinkled pea seed shape--as an example. The dominant allele codes for the synthesis of an enzyme that helps convert sugar to starch in the seed. The recessive allele codes for a defective form of this enzyme. Thus, in a recessive homozygote, sugar accumulates in the seed because it is not converted to starch. As the seed develops, the high sugar concentration causes the osmotic uptake of water, and the seed swells. When the mature seed dries, it develops wrinkles. In contrast, if a dominant allele is present, sugar is converted to starch, and the seeds do not wrinkle when they dry. One dominant allele results in enough of the enzyme to convert sugar to starch, and thus dominant homozygotes and heterozygotes have the same phenotype: round seeds. By exploring the mechanisms responsible for phenotype, we can demystify the concepts of dominance and recessiveness.

There is another important lesson about the meaning of the term dominance. Because an allele for a particular character is dominant does not necessarily mean that it is more common in a population than the recessive allele for that character. For example, about one baby out of 400 in the United States is born with extra fingers or toes, a condition known as polydactyly. The allele for polydactyly is dominant to the allele for five digits per appendage. In other words, 399 out of every 400 people are recessive homozygotes for this character; the recessive allele is far more prevalent than the dominant allele in the population. In Chapter 23, you will learn how the relative frequencies of alleles in a population are affected by natural selection.

Let's summarize three important points about dominance/recessiveness relationships:

1. They range from complete dominance, through various degrees of incomplete dominance, to codominance.

2. They reflect the mechanisms by which specific alleles are expressed in phenotype and do not involve the ability of one allele to subdue another at the level of the DNA.

3. They do not determine or correlate with the relative abundance of alleles in a population.

Multiple Alleles

Most genes actually exist in populations in more than two allelic forms. The ABO blood groups in humans are one example of multiple alleles of a single gene. There are four possible phenotypes for this character: A person's blood group may be either A, B, AB, or O (FIGURE 14.10a). These letters refer to two carbohydrates--the A substance and the B substance--that may be found on the surface of red blood cells. (These groups are based on blood-cell molecules different from those used for the MN classification discussed earlier.) A person's blood cells may have one substance or the other (type A or B), both (type AB), or neither (type O).

Fig 14-10. Multiple alleles for the ABO blood groups.

The four blood groups result from various combinations of three different alleles of one gene, symbolized as IA (for the A carbohydrate), IB (for B), and i (giving rise to neither A nor B). Because each person carries two alleles, six genotypes are possible (FIGURE 14.10b). Both the IA and the IB alleles are dominant to the i allele. Thus, IAIA and IAi individuals have type A blood, and IBIB and IBi individuals have type B. Recessive homozygotes, ii, have type O blood, because neither the A nor the B substance is produced. The IA and IB alleles are codominant; both are expressed in the phenotype of the IAIB heterozygote, who has type AB blood.

Matching compatible blood groups is critical for blood transfusions, because a person produces specific proteins called antibodies against foreign blood factors (FIGURE 14.10c). If the donor's blood has a factor (A or B) that is foreign to the recipient, antibodies produced by the recipient bind to the foreign molecules and cause the donated blood cells to clump together (FIGURE 14.10d). This agglutination (clumping) can kill the recipient.

Pleiotropy

So far, we have treated Mendelian inheritance as though each gene affects one phenotypic character. Most genes, however, have multiple phenotypic effects. The ability of a gene to affect an organism in many ways is called pleiotropy (from the Greek pleion, more). For example, pleiotropic alleles responsible for certain hereditary diseases in humans, such as sickle-cell disease, cause multiple symptoms (see FIGURE 14.15). Considering the intricate molecular and cellular interactions responsible for an organism's development, it is not surprising that a gene can affect a number of an organism's characteristics.

Fig 14-15. Pleiotropic effects of the sickle-cell allele in a homozygote. At the molecular level, the recessive allele responsible for sickle-cell disease has a single direct effect: It causes red blood cells to produce an abnormal version of the protein hemoglobin. An individual who inherits a sickle-cell allele from each parent has only the abnormal variety of hemoglobin. The abnormal hemoglobin deforms the red blood cells, starting a cascade of symptoms throughout the body.

Epistasis

Dominance, multiple alleles, and pleiotropy all involve the effects of alleles for single genes. We now turn to situations involving more than one gene. One such situation is epistasis (from the Greek for "stopping" or "causing to stand"), in which a gene at one locus alters the phenotypic expression of a gene at a second locus. An example will help clarify this concept. In mice and many other mammals, black coat color is dominant to brown. Let's designate B and b as the two alleles for this character. For a mouse to have brown fur, its genotype must be bb. But there is more to the story. A second gene, said to be epistatic to the first, determines whether or not pigment will be deposited in the hair. For this second gene, the dominant allele, symbolized by C (for color), results in the deposition of pigment. This allows either black or brown color, depending on the genotype at the first locus. But if the mouse is homozygous recessive for the second locus (cc), then the coat is white (albino), regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus.

What happens if we mate black mice that are heterozygous for both genes (BbCc)? Although the two genes affect the same phenotypic character (coat color), they follow the law of independent assortment (the two genes are inherited separately). Thus, our breeding experiment represents an F1 dihybrid cross, like those that produced a 9:3:3:1 ratio in Mendel's experiments. In the case of coat color, however, the ratio of phenotypes among F2 offspring is nine black to three brown to four white. FIGURE 14.11 uses a Punnett square to account for this ratio in terms of epistasis. Other types of epistatic interactions produce different ratios.

Fig 14-11. An example of epistasis. This Punnett square illustrates the genotypes and phenotypes predicted for offspring of matings between two black mice of genotype BbCc, where the C/cgene is epistatic to the B/b gene. One gene determines whether the coat will be black (dominant, B) or brown (recessive, b). The second gene controls whether or not pigment of any color will be deposited in the hair, with the allele for the presence of color (C) dominant to the allele for the absence of color (c). The epistatic relationship of the color gene to the black/brown gene results in an F2 phenotypic ratio of 9 black to 3 brown to 4 white.

Polygenic Inheritance

Mendel studied characters that could be classified on an either-or basis, such as purple versus white flower color. For many characters, however, such as human skin color and height, an either-or classification is impossible, because the characters vary in the population along a continuum (in gradations). These are called quantitative characters. Quantitative variation usually indicates polygenic inheritance, an additive effect of two or more genes on a single phenotypic character (the converse of pleiotropy, where a single gene affects several phenotypic characters).

There is evidence, for instance, that skin pigmentation in humans is controlled by at least three separately inherited genes (probably more, but we will simplify). Let's consider three genes, with a dark-skin allele for each gene (A, B, C) contributing one "unit" of darkness to the phenotype and being incompletely dominant to the other alleles (a, b, c). An AABBCC person would be very dark, while an aabbcc individual would be very light. An AaBbCc person would have skin of an intermediate shade. Because the alleles have a cumulative effect, the genotypes AaBbCc and AABbcc would make the same genetic contribution (three units) to skin darkness. FIGURE 14.12 shows how this polygenic inheritance could result in a bell-shaped curve, called a normal distribution, for skin darkness among the members of a hypothetical population. (You are probably familiar with the concept of a normal distribution for class curves of test scores.) Environmental factors, such as exposure to the sun, also affect the skin-color phenotype and help make the graph a smooth curve rather than a stairlike histogram.

Fig 14-12. A simplified model for polygenic inheritance of skin color. According to this model, three separately inherited genes affect the darkness of skin. For each gene, an allele for dark skin (A, B, C) is incompletely dominant to an allele for light skin (a, b, c), Thus, the heterozygous individuals (AaBbCc), represented by the two rectangles at the top of this figure, each carry three "units" of darkness. (Black dots symbolize dark-skin alleles.) Imagine a large number of matings between such heterozygotes. Along the top of the graph are the variations that can occur among offspring. The y axis represents the fractions of these variations among offspring of the matings. The resulting histogram is smoothed into a bell-shaped curve by environmental factors that affect skin color.

Nature and Nurture: The Environmental Impact on Phenotype

Phenotype depends on environment as well as on genes. A single tree, locked into its inherited genotype, has leaves that vary in size, shape, and greenness, depending on exposure to wind and sun. For humans, nutrition influences height, exercise alters build, sun-tanning darkens the skin, and experience improves performance on intelligence tests. Even identical twins, who are genetic equals, accumulate phenotypic differences as a result of their unique experiences.

Whether it is genes or the environment--nature or nurture--that most influences human characteristics is a very old and hotly contested debate that we will not attempt to settle here. We can say, however, that the product of a genotype is generally not a rigidly defined phenotype, but a range of phenotypic possibilities over which there may be variation due to environmental influence. This phenotypic range is called the norm of reaction for a genotype (FIGURE 14.13). There are cases where the norm of reaction has no breadth whatsoever; that is, a given genotype mandates a very specific phenotype. An example is the gene locus that determines a person's ABO blood group. In contrast, a person's blood count of red and white cells varies, depending on such factors as the altitude of one's home, the person's customary level of physical activity, and the presence of infectious agents.

Fig 14-13. The effect of environment on phenotype. The out-come of a genotype lies within its norm of reaction, a phenotypic range that depends on the environment in which the genotype is expressed. For example, hydrangea flowers of the same genetic variety range in color from blue-violet to pink, depending on the acidity of the soil.

Generally, norms of reaction are broadest for polygenic characters. Environment contributes to the quantitative nature of these characters, as we have seen in the continuous variation of skin color. Geneticists refer to such characters as multifactorial, meaning that many factors, both genetic and environmental, collectively influence phenotype.

Integrating a Mendelian View of Heredity and Variation

Over the past several pages, we have broadened our view of Mendelian inheritance by exploring incomplete dominance and other variations in dominance/recessiveness relationships, as well as multiple alleles, pleiotropy, polygenic inheritance, and the phenotypic impact of the environment. How can we integrate these refinements into a comprehensive theory of Mendelian genetics? The key is to make the transition from the reductionist emphasis on single genes and phenotypic characters to the idea of the organism as a whole, one of the themes of this book. In fact, the term phenotype does double duty. We have been using the word in the context of specific characters, such as flower color and blood group. But phenotype is also used to describe the organism in its entirety-- aspects of its physical appearance, internal anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Similarly, the term genotype can also refer to an organism's entire genetic makeup, not just its alleles for a single genetic locus. In most cases, a gene's impact on phenotype is affected by other genes and by the environment. In this integrated view of heredity and variation, an organism's phenotype reflects its overall genotype and unique environmental history.

Considering all that can occur in the pathway from genotype to phenotype, it is indeed impressive that Mendel could simplify the complexities to reveal the fundamental principles governing the transmission of individual genes from parents to offspring. By extending the principles of segregation and independent assortment to help explain such hereditary patterns as epistasis and quantitative characters, we begin to see how broadly Mendelism applies. From Mendel's abbey garden came a theory of particulate inheritance that anchors modern genetics. In the last section of this chapter, we will apply Mendelian genetics to human inheritance, especially the transmission of hereditary diseases.





 Pedigree analysis reveals Mendelian patterns in human inheritance

Unable to manipulate the mating patterns of people, geneticists must analyze the results of matings that have already occurred. As much information as possible is collected about a family's history for a particular trait, and this information is assembled into a family tree describing the interrelationships of parents and children across the generations--the family pedigree. A simple example of a pedigree appears in FIGURE 14.14a, which traces the occurrence of widow's peak (a pointed contour of the hairline on the forehead). The trait is due to a dominant allele, which we symbolize as W.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 14-14. Pedigree analysis. In these family trees, squares symbolize males and circles represent females. A horizontal line connecting a male and female (--) indicates a mating, with offspring listed below in their order of birth, from left to right. Shaded symbols stand for individuals with the trait being traced.

We know that all individuals in this family who lack a widow's peak are homozygous recessive, and thus we can fill in their genotypes on the pedigree (ww). We also know that both grandparents with widow's peaks are heterozygous (Ww); if they were homozygous dominant (WW), then all of their offspring would have widow's peaks. The offspring in this second generation who do have widow's peaks must also be heterozygous, because they are the products of Ww&#160;X&#160;ww matings. The third generation in this pedigree consists of two sisters. The one who has a widow's peak could be either homozygous (WW) or heterozygous (Ww), given what we know about the genotypes of her parents (both Ww).

FIGURE 14.14b is a pedigree of the same family, but this time we focus on a recessive trait, attached earlobes. We'll use f for the recessive allele and F for the dominant allele, which results in free earlobes. As you work your way through the pedigree, notice once again that you can apply what you have learned about Mendelian inheritance to fill in the genotypes for most individuals. (As you may have already guessed, the ears shown in FIGURE 14.14b do not actually belong to the women shown in FIGURE 14.14a. However, their earlobes would resemble those in the photographs.)

A pedigree not only helps us understand the past; it also helps us predict the future. Suppose that the couple represented in the second generation of FIGURE 14.14 decide to have one more child. What is the probability that the child will have a widow's peak? This is a Mendelian F1 cross (Ww&#160;X&#160;Ww), and thus the probability that a child will exhibit the dominant phenotype (widow's peak) is 3/4. What is the probability that the child will have attached earlobes? Again, we can treat this as a monohybrid cross (Ff&#160;X&#160;Ff), but this time we want to know the chance that the offspring will be homozygous recessive. The probability is 1/4. What is the chance that the child will have a widow's peak and attached earlobes? If the two pairs of alleles assort independently in this dihybrid problem (WwFf&#160;X&#160;WwFf), then we can use the rule of multiplication: 3/4 (chance of widow's peak) &#160;X&#160; 1/4 (chance of attached earlobes) = 3/16 (chance of widow's peak and attached earlobes).





 Many human disorders follow Mendelian patterns of inheritance

Pedigrees are a more serious matter when the alleles in question cause disabling or deadly hereditary diseases instead of innocuous human variations such as hairline or earlobe configuration. However, for disorders inherited as simple Mendelian traits, the same techniques of pedigree analysis apply.

Recessively Inherited Disorders

Thousands of genetic disorders are known to be inherited as simple recessive traits. These disorders range in severity from relatively mild, such as albinism (lack of pigmentation, which results in susceptibility to skin cancers and vision problems), to life-threatening, such as cystic fibrosis.

How can we account for the recessive behavior of the alleles causing these disorders? Recall that genes code for proteins of specific function. An allele that causes a genetic disorder codes either for a malfunctional protein or for no protein at all. In the case of disorders classified as recessive, heterozygotes are normal in phenotype because one copy of the "normal" allele produces a sufficient amount of the specific protein. Thus, a recessively inherited disorder shows up only in the homozygous individuals who inherit one recessive allele from each parent. We can symbolize the genotype of such people as aa, with individuals lacking the disorder being either AA or Aa.The heterozygotes (Aa), who are phenotypically normal with regard to the disorder, are called carriers of the disorder because they may transmit the recessive allele to their offspring.

Most people who have recessive disorders are born to parents of normal phenotype who are both carriers. A mating between two carriers corresponds to a Mendelian F1 cross (Aa&#160;X&#160;Aa), with the zygote having a 1/4 chance of inheriting a double dose of the recessive allele. A child of normal phenotype from such a cross has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier. (The genotypic ratio for the offspring is 1AA:2Aa:1aa. Thus, two out of three offspring with normal phenotype--AA or Aa--are predicted to be heterozygous carriers.) Recessive homozygotes could also result from Aa&#160;X&#160;aa and aa&#160;X&#160;aa matings, but if the disorder is lethal before reproductive age or results in sterility, no aa individuals will reproduce. Even if recessive homozygotes are able to reproduce, such individuals will still account for a much smaller percentage of the population than heterozygous carriers, for reasons we will examine in Chapter 23.

In general, a genetic disorder is not evenly distributed among all groups of humans. These disparities result from the different genetic histories of the world's peoples during less technological times, when populations were more geographically (and hence genetically) isolated. We will now examine three examples of recessively inherited disorders.

The most common lethal genetic disease in the United States is cystic fibrosis, which strikes one out of every 2,500 whites of European descent but is much rarer in other groups. One out of 25 whites (4% ) is a carrier. The normal allele for this gene codes for a membrane protein that functions in chloride ion transport between certain cells and the extracellular fluid. These chloride channels are defective or absent in the plasma membranes of children who have inherited two of the recessive alleles that cause cystic fibrosis. The result is an abnormally high concentration of extracellular chloride, which causes the mucus that coats certain cells to become thicker and stickier than normal. The mucus builds up in the pancreas, lungs, digestive tract, and other organs, a condition that favors bacterial infections. Recent research indicates that the extracellular chloride also contributes to infection by disabling a natural antibiotic made by some body cells. When immune cells come to the rescue, their remains add to the mucus, creating a vicious cycle. Untreated, most children with cystic fibrosis die before their fifth birthday. Gentle pounding on the chest to clear mucus from clogged airways, daily doses of antibiotics to prevent infection, and other preventive treatments can prolong life. In the United States, more than half of the people with cystic fibrosis now survive into their late 20s or beyond.

Another lethal disorder inherited as a recessive allele is Tay-Sachs disease, described earlier in the chapter. Recall that the disease is caused by a dysfunctional enzyme that fails to break down brain lipids of a certain class. The symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease usually become manifest a few months after birth. The infant begins to suffer seizures, blindness, and degeneration of motor and mental performance. Inevitably, the child dies within a few years. There is a disproportionately high incidence of Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazic Jews, Jewish people whose ancestors lived in central Europe. In that population, the frequency of Tay-Sachs disease is one out of 3,600 births, about 100 times greater than the incidence among non-Jews or Mediterranean (Sephardic) Jews.

The most common inherited disease among blacks is sickle-cell disease,which affects one out of 400 African Americans. Sickle-cell disease is caused by the substitution of a single amino acid in the hemoglobin protein of red blood cells (see FIGURE 5.19). When the oxygen content of an affected individual's blood is low (at high altitudes or under physical stress, for instance), the sickle-cell hemoglobin molecules crystallize by aggregating into long rods. The crystals deform the red cells into a sickle shape. Sickling of the cells, in turn, can lead to other symptoms. The multiple effects of a double dose of the sickle-cell allele are an example of pleiotropy (FIGURE 14.15). Doctors now use regular blood transfusions to ward off brain damage in children with sickle-cell disease, and new drugs can help prevent or treat other problems, but there is no cure.

The non-sickle-cell counterpart of the sickle-cell allele is in fact only incompletely dominant to the sickle-cell allele at the level of the organism. Heterozygotes--carriers of a single sickle-cell allele--are said to have sickle-cell trait. Such people are usually healthy, although a fraction suffer some symptoms of sickle-cell disease when there is an extended reduction of blood oxygen. At the molecular level, the two alleles are codominant; both normal and abnormal hemoglobins are made.

About one out of ten African Americans has sickle-cell trait, an unusually high frequency of heterozygotes for an allele with severe detrimental effects in homozygotes. The reason for the prevalence of this allele appears to be that a single copy of the sickle-cell allele, while not usually producing sickle-cell symptoms, benefits the carrier by increasing resistance to malaria. The malaria parasite spends part of its life cycle in red blood cells (see FIGURE 28.13), and the presence of even heterozygous amounts of sickle-cell hemoglobin gives these cells an increased fragility that tends to interrupt the cycle. Thus, in tropical Africa, where malaria is common, the sickle-cell allele is both boon and bane. The relatively high frequency of African Americans with sickle-cell trait is a vestige of their African roots.

Although it is relatively unlikely that two carriers of the same rare harmful allele will meet and mate, the probability increases greatly if the man and woman are close relatives (for example, siblings or first cousins). These are called consanguineous ("same blood") matings, and they are indicated in pedigrees by double lines. Because people with recent common ancestors are more likely to carry the same recessive alleles than are unrelated people, it is more likely that a mating of close relatives will produce offspring homozygous for recessive traits--including harmful ones. Such effects can be observed in many types of domesticated and zoo animals that have become inbred.

There is debate among geneticists about the extent to which human consanguinity increases the risk of inherited diseases. Many deleterious alleles have such severe effects that a homozygous embryo spontaneously aborts long before birth. Most societies and cultures have laws or taboos forbidding marriages between close relatives. These rules may have evolved out of empirical observation that in most populations, stillbirths and birth defects are more common when parents are closely related. But social and economic factors have also influenced the development of customs and laws against consanguineous marriages.

Dominantly Inherited Disorders

Although most harmful alleles are recessive, many human disorders are due to dominant alleles. One example is achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism with an incidence of one case among every 10,000 people. Heterozygous individuals have the dwarf phenotype. Therefore, all people who are not achondroplastic dwarfs--99.99%  of the population--are homozygous for the recessive allele.

Lethal dominant alleles are much less common than lethal recessives. Presumably, the two kinds of alleles arise by mutation (changes to the DNA) of a sperm or egg equally often. However, if a lethal dominant allele kills an offspring before it is mature and can reproduce, the allele will not be passed on to future generations. This is in contrast to what happens to lethal recessive mutations, which are perpetuated from generation to generation by the reproduction of heterozygous carriers who have normal phenotypes.

A lethal dominant allele can escape elimination if it is late-acting, causing death at a relatively advanced age. By the time the symptoms become evident, the individual may have already transmitted the lethal allele to his or her children. For example, Huntington's disease, a degenerative disease of the nervous system, is caused by a lethal dominant allele that has no obvious phenotypic effect until the individual is about 35 to 45 years old. Once the deterioration of the nervous system begins, it is irreversible and inevitably fatal. Any child born to a parent who has the allele for Huntington's disease has a 50%  chance of inheriting the allele and the disorder. (The mating can be symbolized as Aa&#160;X&#160;aa, with A being the dominant allele that causes Huntington's disease.) Until recently, it was impossible to tell before the onset of symptoms if a person at risk for Huntington's disease had actually inherited the allele, but that has changed. Analyzing DNA samples from a large family with a high incidence of the disorder, molecular geneticists have tracked the Huntington's allele to a locus near the tip of chromosome 4 (FIGURE 14.16). It is now possible to test for the presence of the allele in an individual's genome. (The methods that make such tests possible are discussed in Chapter 20.) For those with a family history of Huntington's disease, the availability of this test poses an agonizing dilemma: Under what circumstances is it beneficial for a presently healthy person to find out whether he or she has inherited a fatal and not yet curable disease?

Fig 14-16. Large families provide excellent case studies of human genetics. Here, Nancy Wexler, of Columbia University and the Hereditary Disease Foundation, studies a huge pedigree that traces Huntington's disease through several generations of one large family in Venezuela. Classical Mendelian analysis of this family, coupled with the techniques of molecular biology, enabled scientists to develop a test for the presence of the dominant allele that causes Huntington's disease--a test that can be used before symptoms appear. Dr. Wexler is herself at risk for developing Huntington's disease. Her mother died of the disorder, and there is a 50%  chance that Dr. Wexler inherited the dominant allele that causes the disease.

Multifactorial Disorders

The hereditary diseases we have discussed so far are sometimes described as simple Mendelian disorders because they result from certain alleles at a single genetic locus. Many more people are susceptible to diseases that have a multifactorial basis--a genetic component plus a significant environmental influence. The long list of multifactorial diseases includes heart disease, diabetes, cancer, alcoholism, and certain mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. In many cases, the hereditary component is polygenic. For example, many genes affect our cardiovascular health, making some of us more prone than others to heart attacks and strokes. But our lifestyle intervenes tremendously between genotype and phenotype for cardiovascular health and other multifactorial characters. Exercise, a healthful diet, abstinence from smoking, and an ability to put stressful situations in perspective all reduce our risk of heart disease and some types of cancer.

At present, so little is understood about the genetic contributions to most multifactorial diseases that the best public health strategy is to educate people about the importance of environmental factors and to promote healthful behavior.





 Technology is providing new tools for genetic testing and counseling

A preventive approach to simple Mendelian disorders is sometimes possible, because the risk that a particular genetic disorder will occur can sometimes be assessed before a child is conceived or during the early stages of the pregnancy. Many hospitals have genetic counselors who can provide information to prospective parents concerned about a family history for a specific disease.

Let's consider the case of a hypothetical couple, John and Carol, who are planning to have their first child and are seeking genetic counseling because of family histories of a lethal disease known to be recessively inherited. John and Carol each had a brother who died of the disorder, so they want to determine the risk of their having a child with the disease. From the information about their brothers, we know that both parents of John and both parents of Carol must have been carriers of the recessive allele. Thus, John and Carol are both products of Aa&#160;X&#160;Aa crosses, where a symbolizes the allele that causes this particular disease. We also know that John and Carol are not homozygous recessive (aa), because they do not have the disease. Therefore, their genotypes are either AA or Aa. Given a genotypic ratio of 1AA:2Aa:1aa for offspring of an Aa&#160;X&#160;Aacross, John and Carol each have a 2/3 chance of being carriers (Aa). Using the rule of multiplication, we can determine that the overall probability of their firstborn having the disorder is 2/3 (the chance that John is a carrier) multiplied by 2/3 (the chance that Carol is a carrier) multiplied by 1/4 (the chance of two carriers having a child with the disease), which equals 1/9. Suppose that Carol and John decide to take the risk and have a child--after all, there is an 8/9 chance that their baby will not have the disorder--but their child is born with the disease. We no longer have to guess about John's and Carol's genotypes. We now know that both John and Carol are, in fact, carriers. If the couple decides to have another child, they now know there is a 1/4 chance that the second child will have the disease.

When we use Mendel's laws to predict possible outcomes of matings, it is important to keep in mind that chance has no memory: Each child represents an independent event in the sense that its genotype is unaffected by the genotypes of older siblings. Suppose that John and Carol have three more children, and all three have the hypothetical hereditary disease. This is an unfortunate family, for there is only one chance in 64 (1/4 &#160;X&#160; 1/4 &#160;X&#160; 1/4) that such an outcome will occur. But this run of misfortune will in no way affect the result if John and Carol decide to have still another child. There is still a 1/4 chance that the additional child will have the disease and a 3/4 chance that it will not. Mendel's laws, remember, are simply rules of probability applied to heredity.

Carrier Recognition

Because most children with recessive disorders are born to parents with normal phenotypes, the key to assessing the genetic risk for a particular disease is determining whether the prospective parents are heterozygous carriers of the recessive trait. For some heritable disorders, there are now tests that can distinguish individuals of normal phenotype who are dominant homozygotes from those who are heterozygotes, and the number of such tests increases each year. Examples are tests that can identify carriers of the alleles for Tay-Sachs disease, sickle-cell disease, and the most common form of cystic fibrosis. On one hand, these tests enable people with family histories of genetic disorders to make informed decisions about having children. On the other hand, these new methods for genetic screening could be abused. If confidentiality is breached, will carriers be stigmatized? Will they be denied health or life insurance, even though they themselves are healthy? Will misinformed employers equate "carrier" with disease? And will sufficient genetic counseling be available to help a large number of individuals understand their test results?

New biotechnology offers possibilities of reducing human suffering, but not before key ethical issues are resolved. The dilemmas posed by human genetics reinforce one of this book's themes: the immense social implications of biology.

Fetal Testing

Suppose a couple learns that they are both Tay-Sachs carriers, but they decide to have a child anyway. Tests performed in conjunction with a technique known as amniocentesis can determine, beginning at the 14th to 16th week of pregnancy, whether the developing fetus has Tay-Sachs disease (FIGURE 14.17a). To perform this procedure, a physician inserts a needle into the uterus and extracts about 10 milliliters (mL) of amniotic fluid, the liquid that bathes the fetus. Some genetic disorders can be detected from the presence of certain chemicals in the amniotic fluid itself. Tests for other disorders, including Tay-Sachs disease, are performed on cells grown in the laboratory from the fetal cells that had been sloughed off into the amniotic fluid. These cultured cells can also be used for karyotyping to identify certain chromosomal defects (see FIGURE 13.3).

Fig 14-17. Testing a fetus for genetic disorders.

In an alternative technique called chorionic villus sampling (CVS)(FIGURE 14.17b) a physician inserts a narrow tube through the cervix into the uterus and suctions out a tiny sample of fetal tissue from the placenta, the organ that transmits nutrients and fetal wastes between the fetus and the mother. Because the cells of the chorionic villi of the placenta are proliferating rapidly, enough cells are undergoing mitosis to allow karyotyping to be carried out immediately, giving results within 24 hours. This is an advantage over amniocentesis, in which the cells must be cultured for several weeks before karyotyping. Another advantage of CVS is that it can be performed as early as the eighth to tenth week of pregnancy. However, CVS is not suitable for tests requiring amniotic fluid, and it is less widely available than amniocentesis. Recently, medical scientists have developed methods for isolating fetal cells that have escaped into the mother's blood. Although very few in number, these cells can be cultured and then tested.

Other techniques allow a physician to examine a fetus directly for major anatomical abnormalities. One such technique is ultrasound, which uses sound waves to produce an image of the fetus by a simple noninvasive procedure. This procedure, which is also used to locate the fetus during amniocentesis, has no known risk to either fetus or mother. With another technique, fetoscopy,a needle-thin tube containing a viewing scope and fiber optics (to transmit light) is inserted into the uterus.

In about 1%  of the cases, amniocentesis or fetoscopy causes complications, such as maternal bleeding or fetal death. Thus, these techniques are usually reserved for cases in which the risk of a genetic disorder or other type of birth defect is relatively great. If the fetal tests reveal a serious disorder, the parents face the difficult choice of terminating the pregnancy or preparing to care for a child with a genetic disorder.

Newborn Screening

Some genetic disorders can be detected at birth by simple tests that are now routinely performed in most hospitals in the United States. One screening program is for the recessively inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU), which occurs in about one out of every 10,000 to 15,000 births in the United States. Children with this disease cannot properly break down the amino acid phenylalanine. This compound and its by-product, phenylpyruvate, can accumulate to toxic levels in the blood, causing mental retardation. However, if the deficiency is detected in the newborn, a special diet low in phenylalanine can usually promote normal development and prevent retardation. Thus, screening newborns for PKU and other treatable disorders can be vitally important. Unfortunately, very few genetic disorders are treatable at the present time.

In this chapter, you have learned about the Mendelian model of inheritance and its application to human genetics. We owe the "gene idea," the concept of heritable factors transmitted according to simple rules of chance, to the elegant experiments of Gregor Mendel. Mendel's quantitative approach was foreign to the biology of his era, and even the few biologists who read his papers apparently overlooked the importance of his discoveries. It wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that Mendelian genetics was rediscovered by biologists studying the role of chromosomes in inheritance. In the next chapter, you will learn how Mendel's laws have their physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles and how the synthesis of Mendelism and a chromosome theory of inheritance catalyzed progress in genetics.

It was not until the year 1900 that biology finally caught up with Gregor Mendel. At that time, three botanists, working independently on plant-breeding experiments, reproduced Mendel's results. By searching the scientific literature, the German Karl Correns, the Austrian Erich von Tschermak, and the Dutchman Hugo de Vries all found that Mendel had explained the same results 35 years before. During the intervening years, biology had grown more experimental and quantitative and thus more receptive to Mendelism. Nevertheless, many biologists remained incredulous about Mendel's laws of segregation and independent assortment until evidence had mounted that these principles of heredity had a physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes. Mendel's hereditary factors--genes--are located on chromosomes. For example, the yellow dots (a fluorescent dye) in the light micrograph on this page mark the locus of a specific gene on a homologous pair of human chromosomes (which have already replicated, hence the two dots per chromosome). This chapter integrates and extends what you have learned in the past two chapters by describing the chromosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, along with some important exceptions.

 Sex-linked genes have unique patterns of inheritance



You learned earlier that Morgan's discovery of a sex-linked trait (white eyes) was a key episode in the development of a chromosome theory of inheritance. In this section, we consider the role of sex chromosomes in inheritance in more detail. We begin by reviewing the genetics of sex in humans and comparing it with sex determination in some other animals.

 Extranuclear genes exhibit a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance



Sex-linked traits are not the only notable deviation from the inheritance patterns observed by Mendel, and the gene mutations that create new alleles are not the only kind of changes to the genome that can affect phenotype. The last section of this chapter discusses major chromosomal aberrations and their consequences, as well as two types of normal inheritance that are exceptions to the standard chromosome theory.





 Mendelian inheritance has its physical basis in the behavior of chromosomes during sexual life cycles

Using improved microscopy techniques, cytologists worked out the process of mitosis in 1875 and meiosis in the 1890s. Then, around 1900, cytology and genetics converged as biologists began to see parallels between the behavior of chromosomes and the behavior of Mendel's factors. For example, chromosomes and genes are both present in pairs in diploid cells, homologous chromosomes separate and alleles segregate during meiosis, and fertilization restores the paired condition for both chromosomes and genes. Around 1902, Walter S. Sutton, Theodor Boveri, and others independently noted these parallels, and a chromosome theory of inheritance began to take form. According to this theory, Mendelian genes have specific loci on chromosomes, and it is the chromosomes that undergo segregation and independent assortment (FIGURE 15.1, p. 270).

Fig 15-1. The chromosomal basis of Mendel's laws. Here we correlate the results of one of Mendel's dihybrid crosses (see FIGURE 14.7b) with the behavior of chromosomes. The arrangement of chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis and their movement during anaphase I account for the segregation and independent assortment of the alleles for seed color and shape. Because the alternatives at metaphase I are equally likely, F1 plants produce equal numbers of four kinds of gametes.





 Morgan traced a gene to a specific chromosome

Thomas Hunt Morgan, an embryologist at Columbia University, was the first to associate a specific gene with a specific chromosome, early in the 20th century. Although Morgan was skeptical about both Mendelism and the chromosome theory, his early experiments provided convincing evidence that chromosomes are indeed the location of Mendel's heritable factors.

Morgan's Choice of Experimental Organism

Many times in the history of biology, important discoveries have come to those insightful enough or lucky enough to choose an experimental organism suitable for the research problem being tackled. Mendel chose the garden pea because a number of distinct varieties were available. For his work, Morgan selected a species of fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a common, generally innocuous insect that feeds on the fungi growing on fruit. (Some other kinds of fruit flies, such as "medflies,"Ceratitis capitata, can seriously damage crops.) Fruit flies are prolific breeders; a single mating will produce hundreds of offspring, and a new generation can be bred every two weeks. These characteristics make the fruit fly a convenient organism for genetic studies. Morgan's laboratory soon became known as "the fly room."

Another advantage of the fruit fly is that it has only four pairs of chromosomes, which are easily distinguishable with a light microscope. There are three pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Female fruit flies have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.

While Mendel could readily obtain different pea varieties, there were no convenient suppliers of fruit fly varieties for Morgan to employ. Indeed, he was probably the first person to want different varieties of this common insect. After a year of breeding flies and looking for variant individuals, Morgan was rewarded with the discovery of a single male fly with white eyes instead of the usual red. The normal phenotype for a character (the phenotype most common in natural populations), such as red eyes in Drosophila, is called the wild type (FIGURE 15.2). Traits that are alternatives to the wild type, such as white eyes in Drosophila, are called mutant phenotypes, because they are due to alleles assumed to have originated as changes, or mutations, in the wild-type allele.

Fig 15-2. Morgan's first mutant. Wild-type Drosophila flies have red eyes (left). Among his flies, Morgan discovered a mutant male with white eyes (right). This variation made it possible for Morgan to trace a gene for eye color to a specific chromosome (LMs).

Discovery of Sex Linkage

After Morgan discovered his white-eyed male fly, he mated it with a red-eyed female. All the F1 offspring had red eyes, suggesting that the wild type was dominant. When Morgan bred the F1 flies to each other, he observed the classical 3:1 phenotypic ratio among the F2 offspring. However, there was a surprising additional result: The white-eye trait showed up only in males. All the F2 females had red eyes, while half the males had red eyes and half had white eyes. Somehow, a fly's eye color was linked to its sex.

From this and other evidence, Morgan deduced that the gene affected in his white-eyed mutant is located exclusively on the X chromosome; there is no corresponding eye-color locus on the Y chromosome (FIGURE 15.3, p. 272). Thus, females (XX) carry two copies of the gene for this character, while males (XY) carry only one. Because the mutant allele is recessive, a female will have white eyes only if she receives that allele on both X chromosomes--an impossibility for the F2 females in Morgan's experiment. For a male, on the other hand, a single copy of the mutant allele confers white eyes; since a male has only one X chromosome, there can be no wild-type allele present to offset the recessive allele.

Fig 15-3. Sex-linked inheritance. When Morgan bred his mutant male to a wild-type female, all F1 offspring had red eyes. The F2 generation showed a typical Mendelian 3:1 ratio of traits, but the recessive trait--white eyes--was linked to sex. All females had red eyes, but half the males had white eyes. Morgan hypothesized that the gene responsible was located on the X chromosome and that there was no corresponding locus on the Y chromosome.

Genes located on a sex chromosome are called sex-linked genes. Morgan's evidence that a specific gene is carried on the X chromosome added credibility to the chromosome theory of inheritance. Recognizing the importance of this work, many bright students were attracted to Morgan's fly room, and his laboratory dominated genetics research for the next three decades. We will see the influence of Morgan and his colleagues as we consider some other important aspects of the chromosomal basis of inheritance.





 Linked genes tend to be inherited together because they are located on the same chromosome

The number of genes in a cell is far greater than the number of chromosomes; in fact, each chromosome has hundreds or thousands of genes. Genes located on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together in genetic crosses because the chromosome is passed along as a unit. Such genes are said to be linked genes. (Note that these genes are linked to each other. Here the use of the word linked is different from its use in the term sex-linked gene, where the gene is on a sex chromosome.) When geneticists follow linked genes in breeding experiments, the results deviate from those expected according to the Mendelian principle of independent assortment.

Let's examine another of Morgan's Drosophila experiments to see how linkage between genes affects the inheritance of two different characters (FIGURE 15.4). In this case, the characters are body color and wing size. Wild-type flies have gray bodies and normal wings. Morgan had flies with mutant versions of these characters: black body and vestigial wings (much smaller than normal wings). The alleles for these traits are represented by the following symbols: b+ = gray, b = black; vg+ = normal wings, vg = vestigial wings.* The mutant alleles are recessive to the wild-type alleles, and neither gene is sex-linked.

Fig 15-4. Evidence for linked genes in Drosophila. The tinted area highlights a testcross between a dihybrid female fly, heterozygous for both body color and wing size, and a double-recessive male, homozygous for both recessive alleles. (The male has a "double mutant" phenotype.) When Morgan "scored" (classified according to phenotype) 2,300 offspring from such matings, he observed a much higher proportion of parental phenotypes than would be expected if the two genes assorted independently. Morgan concluded that these genes are usually transmitted together because they are located on the same chromosome. Crossing over accounts for the recombinant phenotypes (combinations of traits different from the combination in either parent).

Morgan mated true-breeding wild-type flies (b+b+vg+vg1+) with black, vestigial-winged ones (b b vg vg) to produce F1 dihybrids (b+bvg+vg), which are wild type in appearance. He then crossed female dihybrids with males of the "double-mutant" phenotype (b b vg vg). Notice that this cross corresponds to a Mendelian testcross. According to Mendel's law of independent assortment, Morgan's Drosophila testcross should produce four phenotypic classes of offspring that are about equal in number: 1 gray-normal : 1 black-vestigial : 1 gray-vestigial : 1 black-normal. (To see why, rework FIGURE 14.6 with a dihybrid.) But the actual results were different: There were disproportionately large numbers of wild-type (gray-normal) and double-mutant (black-vestigial) flies among the offspring. These two phenotypes correspond to those of the P generation parents, as well as to those of the parents in the testcross. Morgan reasoned that body color and wing shape are usually inherited together in specific combinations because the genes for these characters are on the same chromosome:

Although the other two phenotypes (gray-vestigial and black-normal) numbered fewer than expected based on independent assortment, these phenotypes were represented among the offspring of Morgan's cross. These new phenotypic variations resulted from crossing over, discussed next.





 Independent assortment of chromosomes and crossing over produce genetic recombinants

In Chapter 13, we saw that meiosis and random fertilization generate genetic variation among offspring of sexually reproducing organisms. The general term for the production of offspring with new combinations of traits inherited from two parents is genetic recombination. Here we will examine the chromosomal basis of recombination in more detail.

The Recombination of Unlinked Genes: Independent Assortment of Chromosomes

Mendel learned from his study of dihybrid plants that some offspring have combinations of traits that do not match either parent in the parental (P) generation. To see an example, draw a Punnett square for a testcross between a pea plant with yellow-round seeds that is heterozygous for both seed color and seed shape (YyRr, the F1 in FIGURE 15.1) and a plant with green-wrinkled seeds (homozygous for both recessive alleles, yyrr). Your Punnett square will predict ratios of genotypes and phenotypes in the offspring similar to what Mendel actually found because the gene loci for seed color and seed shape are on separate chromosomes. In other words, the genes for seed shape and seed color are unlinked, their alleles assorting independently. Notice in your Punnett square that one-half of the offspring of the testcross should inherit a phenotype that matches one of the parental phenotypes--either yellow-round seeds or wrinkled-green seeds. These offspring are called parental types (strictly speaking, "parental" here refers to the phenotypes of the P generation plants, which are the grandparents in this case). But other phenotypes are also represented: One-fourth of the offspring have green-round seeds, and one-fourth have yellow-wrinkled seeds. Because these offspring have new combinations of seed shape and color, they are called recombinants. When 50%  of all offspring are recombinants, as in the example here, geneticists say that there is a 50%  frequency of recombination.

A 50%  frequency of recombination is observed for any two genes that are located on different chromosomes. The physical basis of recombination between unlinked genes is the random orientation of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I of meiosis, which leads to the independent assortment of alleles (again, see FIGURE 15.1).

The Recombination of Linked Genes: Crossing Over

Linked genes do not assort independently because they are located on the same chromosomes and tend to move together through meiosis and fertilization. We would not expect linked genes to recombine into assortments of alleles not found in the parents. But in fact, recombination between linked genes does occur. To see how, let's return to Morgan's fly room.

How can we explain the results of the Drosophila cross illustrated in FIGURE 15.4? The offspring of the testcross for body color and wing shape did not conform to the 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio we would expect if the genes for these two characters were on different chromosomes and assorted independently. But if the two genes are completely linked because their loci are on the same chromosome, then we should observe a 1:1:0:0 ratio, with only the parental phenotypes represented among offspring. The actual results satisfy neither of these expectations. Most of the offspring had parental phenotypes, suggesting linkage between the two genes, but about 17%  of the flies were recombinants. Although there was linkage, it appeared incomplete.

Morgan proposed that some mechanism that exchanges segments between homologous chromosomes must occasionally break the linkage between the two genes. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that such an exchange--crossing over--accounts for the recombination of linked genes. While homologous chromosomes are paired during prophase of meiosis I, nonsister chromatids may break at corresponding points and switch fragments; that is, they cross over (see FIGURE 13.9). The recombinant chromosomes resulting from crossing over may bring together alleles in new combinations, and the subsequent events of meiosis distribute the recombinant chromosomes to gametes (FIGURE 15.5a). This sequence of events accounts for the occurrence of recombinant phenotypes in the offspring of Morgan's testcross (FIGURE 15.5b).

The b and vg loci are linked; they are on the same chromosome. The maternal chromosomes are color-coded with two shades of red so that we can distinguish one homologue from the other.





 Geneticists can use recombination data to map a chromosome's genetic loci

The discovery of linked genes and recombination due to crossing over led one of Morgan's students, Alfred H. Sturtevant, to a method for constructing a genetic map, an ordered list of the genetic loci along a particular chromosome.

Sturtevant hypothesized that recombination frequencies calculated from experiments like the one in FIGURE 15.5 reflect the distances between genes on a chromosome. Assuming that the chance of crossing over is approximately equal at all points on a chromosome, he predicted that the farther apart two genes are, the higher the probability that a crossover will occur between them and therefore the higher the recombination frequency. His reasoning was simple: The greater the distance between two genes, the more points there are between them where crossing over can occur. With this idea in mind, Sturtevant began using recombination data from fruit fly crosses to assign to genes relative positions on chromosomes--that is, to map genes. A genetic map based on recombination frequencies is specifically called a linkage map.

FIGURE 15.6 shows Sturtevant's map of three genes relative to each other, the body-color (b) and wing-size (vg) genes depicted in FIGURE 15.5 and a third gene on the same chromosome, called cinnabar (cn). Cinnabar is one of many Drosophila genes affecting eye color. Cinnabar eyes, a mutant phenotype, are a brighter red than the wild-type color. The recombination frequency between cn and b is 9% , and the recombination frequency between cn and vg is 9.5% . In other words, crossovers between cn and b and between cn and vg are only about half as frequent as crossovers between b and vg (17% ). Only a map that locates cn about midway between b and vg is consistent with the data (as you can prove to yourself by drawing alternative maps). Sturtevant expressed the distances between genes in map units, defining one map unit as equivalent to a 1%  recombination frequency. Today, the word centimorgan is often used, in honor of Morgan.

Fig 15-6. Using recombination frequencies to construct a genetic map. The method for making this type of map, called a linkage map, is based on the assumption that the probability of a crossover between two genetic loci is proportional to the distance separating the loci. In this example of a linkage map, re-combination frequencies have been used to locate three Drosophila genes: b, vg, and cn. The data best fit a sequence with cn positioned about halfway between the other two genes. The likely reason for the slightly low b-vg frequency is given in the text below.

Some genes on a chromosome are so far apart from each other that a crossover between them is virtually certain. The frequency of recombination measured between such genes can have a maximum value of 50% , a result indistinguishable from that for genes on different chromosomes. In fact, the seven characters that Mendel studied in his peas are not all on separate chromosomes, although the pea coincidentally has seven chromosome pairs. Seed color and flower color, for instance, are now known to be on chromosome 1. But they are so far apart on that chromosome that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. Genes located far apart on a chromosome are mapped by adding the recombination frequencies from crosses involving each of the distant genes and a number of genes lying between them. Only for one pair of the genes Mendel studied, the genes for plant height and pod shape, do modern biologists observe linkage. Although Mendel observed segregation of alleles for each of these characters in monohybrid crosses, he did not report the results of dihybrid crosses for this particular combination of characters.

Even when the distance between genetic loci on a chromosome is not great enough to "unlink" them, it may be great enough to create a significant likelihood of more than one crossover between the loci. A second crossover "cancels out" the first and thus reduces the observed number of recombinant offspring. Multiple crossovers are the main reason for the numerical discrepancy in FIGURE 15.6, where the recombination frequency between b and vg is less than the sum of the b-cn and cn-vg frequencies.

Using crossover data, Sturtevant and his colleagues were able to map the other identified Drosophila genes in linear arrays. They found that the genes clustered into four groups of linked genes. Because microscopists had found four pairs of chromosomes in Drosophila cells, this clustering of genes was additional evidence that genes are located on chromosomes. Each chromosome has a linear array of specific gene loci (FIGURE 15.7).

Fig 15-7. A partial genetic map of a Drosophila chromosome. This simplified map shows just a few of the genes that have been mapped on Drosophila chromosome II. Notice that more than one gene can affect a given phenotypic characteristic, such as eye color.

Because a linkage map is based on recombination frequencies, it is not really a picture of a chromosome. The frequency of crossing over is not actually uniform over the length of the chromosome, and therefore map units do not have absolute size (in nanometers, for instance). Thus, a linkage map portrays the sequence of genes along a chromosome, but it does not give the precise locations of genes. Other methods enable geneticists to construct cytological maps of chromosomes, which locate genes with respect to chromosomal features, such as stained bands, that can be seen in the microscope (see FIGURE 15.14). The ultimate genetic maps, which we'll discuss in Chapter 20, show the distances between gene loci in DNA nucleotides. Comparing a linkage map with this type of map (or even with a cytological map) of the same chromosome, we find that the sequence of genes matches, but the spacing between them does not.





 The chromosomal basis of sex varies with the organism

Our sex is one of our more obvious phenotypic characters. Although the anatomical and physiological differences between women and men are numerous, the chromosomal basis of sex is rather simple. In humans and other mammals, as in fruit flies, there are two varieties of sex chromosomes, designated X and Y. A person who inherits two X chromosomes, one from each parent, usually develops as a female. A male usually develops from a zygote containing one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (see FIGURE 15.8a and the karyotype in FIGURE 13.3). When meiosis occurs in the testis, the X and Y chromosomes behave like homologous chromosomes, although they are only partially homologous and undergo very little crossing over with each other.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 15-8. Some chromosomal systems of sex determination. Numerals indicate the number of autosomes, the nonsex chromo-somes. In Drosophila, males are XY, but sex is actually determined by the number of X chromosomes, as in part b.

In both testes and ovaries, the two sex chromosomes segregate during meiosis, and each gamete receives one. Each ovum contains one X chromosome. In contrast, sperm fall into two categories: Half the sperm cells a male produces contain an X chromosome, and half contain a Y chromosome. We can trace the sex of each offspring to the moment of conception: If a sperm cell bearing an X chromosome happens to fertilize an ovum, the zygote is XX; if a sperm cell containing a Y chromosome fertilizes an ovum, the zygote is XY. Sex is a matter of chance--a fifty-fifty chance. FIGURE 15.8 compares this X-Y system of mammals to chromosomal systems of sex determination in other animal groups.

In humans, the anatomical signs of sex begin to emerge when the embryo is about two months old. Before then, the rudiments of the gonads are generic--they can develop into either ovaries or testes, depending on hormonal conditions within the embryo. Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on whether or not a Y chromosome is present. In 1990, a British research team identified a gene required for the development of testes. They named the gene SRY, for sex-determining region of Y. In the absence of SRY, the gonads develop into ovaries. The researchers emphasized that the presence (or absence) of SRY is just a trigger. The biochemical, physiological, and anatomical features of sex are complex, and many genes are involved in their development. SRY codes for a protein that regulates many other genes. Recently, researchers have identified a number of additional genes on the Y chromosome that are required for normal testis functioning. In the absence of these genes, an XY individual is male but does not produce normal sperm.





 Sex-linked genes have unique patterns of inheritance

In addition to their role in determining sex, the sex chromosomes, especially X chromosomes, have genes for many characters unrelated to sex. In humans, the term sex-linked usually refers to genes on the X chromosome. These genes follow the same pattern of inheritance that Morgan observed for the white-eye locus in Drosophila. Fathers pass sex-linked alleles to all of their daughters but none of their sons (FIGURE 15.9). In contrast, mothers can pass sex-linked alleles to both sons and daughters.

Fig 15-9. The transmission of sex-linked recessive traits. In this diagram, the superscript A represents a dominant allele carried on the X chromosome, and the superscript a represents a recessive allele. Imagine that this recessive allele is a mutation that causes a sex-linked disorder, such as hemophilia. White boxes indicate unaffected individuals, light-colored boxes indicate carriers, and dark-colored boxes indicate individuals with the sex-linked disorder.

If a sex-linked trait is due to a recessive allele, a female will express the phenotype only if she is a homozygote. Because males have only one locus, the terms homozygous and heterozygous lack meaning for describing their sex-linked genes (the term hemizygous is used in such cases). Any male receiving the recessive allele from his mother will express the trait. For this reason, far more males than females have disorders that are inherited as sex-linked recessives. However, even though the chance of a female inheriting a double dose of the mutant allele is much less than the probability of a male inheriting a single dose, there are females with sex-linked disorders. For instance, color blindness is a mild disorder inherited as a sex-linked trait. A color-blind daughter may be born to a color-blind father whose mate is a carrier (see FIGURE 15.9c). However, because the sex-linked allele for color blindness is relatively rare, the probability that such a man and woman will mate is low.

Sex-Linked Disorders in Humans

A number of human sex-linked disorders are much more serious than color blindness. An example is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects about one out of every 3,500 males born in the United States. People with Duchenne muscular dystrophy rarely live past their early 20s. The disease is characterized by a progressive weakening of the muscles and loss of coordination. Researchers have traced the disorder to the absence of a key muscle protein called dystrophin and have tracked the gene for this protein to a specific locus on the X chromosome. These discoveries may eventually lead to treatments to prevent the disease from progressing.

Hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive trait defined by the absence of one or more of the proteins required for blood clotting. When a person with hemophilia is injured, bleeding is prolonged because a firm clot is slow to form. Small cuts in the skin are usually not a problem, but bleeding in the muscles or joints, which can occur without known cause, can be painful and can lead to serious damage. Today, people with hemophilia are treated as needed with intravenous injections of the missing protein.

Hemophilia has an interesting history. The ancient Hebrews must have had some understanding of its hereditary pattern because sons born to women having a family history of hemophilia were exempted from circumcision. Moreover, a high frequency of sex-linked hemophilia has plagued the royal families of Europe. The first hemophiliac in the royal line seems to have been Leopold, a son of Queen Victoria (1819-1901) of England. The recessive allele for hemophilia was probably introduced to the royal family through a mutation in one of the sex cells of Victoria's mother or father, making Victoria a heterozygote, a carrier of the deadly allele. Leopold survived to father a daughter who was also a carrier, transmitting hemophilia to one of her sons. Hemophilia was eventually brought to the royal families of Prussia, Russia, and Spain through the marriages of two of Victoria's daughters.

X Inactivation in Female Mammals

Although female mammals, including humans, inherit two X chromosomes, one X chromosome in each cell becomes almost completely inactivated during embryonic development. As a result, the cells of females and males have the same effective dose (one copy) of genes with loci on the X chromosome. The inactive X in each cell of a female condenses into a compact object, called a Barr body, which lies along the inside of the nuclear envelope. Most of the genes of the X chromosome that forms the Barr body are not expressed, although some remain active. (Barr-body chromosomes are reactivated in the ovary cells that give rise to ova.)

British geneticist Mary Lyon has demonstrated that the selection of which of the two X chromosomes will form the Barr body occurs randomly and independently in each of the embryonic cells present at the time of X inactivation. As a consequence, females consist of a mosaic of two types of cells (FIGURE 15.10): those with the active X derived from the father and those with the active X derived from the mother. After an X chromosome is inactivated in a particular cell, all mitotic descendants of that cell have the same inactive X. Therefore, if the female is heterozygous for a sex-linked trait, approximately half her cells will express one allele, while the others will express the alternate allele. This mosaicism can be seen in the coloration of a tortoiseshell cat, which has patches of orange and black fur (see FIGURE 15.10). In humans, mosaicism can be seen in a recessive X-linked mutation that prevents the development of sweat glands. A woman who is heterozygous for this trait has patches of normal skin and patches of skin lacking sweat glands.

Fig 15-10. X inactivation and the tortoiseshell cat. The tortoiseshell gene is on the X chromosome, and the tortoiseshell phenotype requires the presence of two different alleles, one for orange fur and one for nonorange (black) fur. Normally, only females can have both alleles, because only they have two X chromosomes. If a female is heterozygous for the tortoiseshell gene, she is tortoiseshell. Orange patches are formed by populations of cells in which the Xchromosome with the orange allele is active: black patches have cells in which the X chromosome with the nonorange allele is active. ("Calico" cats also have white areas, which are determined by yet another gene.)

Inactivation of an X chromosome involves attachment of methyl groups (--CH3) to cytosine, one of the nitrogenous bases of DNA nucleotides. (The regulatory role of DNA methylation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.) But what determines which of the two X chromosomes is targeted for methylation? Researchers have discovered a gene that is active only on the Barr-body chromosome. The gene is called XIST, for X-inactive specific transcript. The gene's product, or "specific transcript," is an RNA molecule, and multiple copies of this molecule apparently attach to the X chromosome where they are made, eventually almost covering it. Interaction of this RNA with the chromosome seems to initiate X inactivation. But this finding leads to more questions. What exactly is the connection between XIST RNA and DNA methylation? And what determines which of the two X chromosomes in each of a female's cells will have a continually active XIST gene and become the Barr body? Our understanding of X inactivation is still rudimentary.





 Alterations of chromosome number or structurecause some genetic disorders

Physical and chemical disturbances, as well as errors during meiosis, can damage chromosomes in major ways or alter their number in a cell. Here we survey such chromosomal alterations and see how they relate to some important human disorders.

Alterations of Chromosome Number: Aneuploidy and Polyploidy

Ideally, the meiotic spindle distributes chromosomes to daughter cells without error. But there is an occasional mishap called a nondisjunction, in which the members of a pair of homologous chromosomes do not move apart properly during meiosis I or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis II. In these cases, one gamete receives two of the same type of chromosome and another gamete receives no copy (FIGURE 15.11). The other chromosomes are usually distributed normally. If either of the aberrant gametes unites with a normal one at fertilization, the offspring will have an abnormal chromosome number, known as aneuploidy. If a chromosome is present in triplicate in the fertilized egg (so that the cell has a total of 2n + 1 chromosomes), the aneuploid cell is said to be trisomic for that chromosome. If a chromosome is missing (so that the cell has 2n - 1 chromosomes), the aneuploid cell is monosomic for that chromosome. Mitosis will subsequently transmit the anomaly to all embryonic cells. If the organism survives, it usually has a set of symptoms caused by the abnormal dose of the genes associated with the extra or missing chromosome. Nondisjunction can also occur during mitosis. If such an error takes place early in embryonic development, then the aneuploid condition is passed along by mitosis to a large number of cells and is likely to have a substantial effect on the organism.

Fig 15-11. Meiotic nondisjunction. Either type of meiotic error will produce gametes with an abnormal chromosome number.

Some organisms have more than two complete chromosome sets. The general term for this chromosomal alteration is polyploidy, with the specific terms triploidy (3n) and tetraploidy (4n) indicating three or four chromosomal sets, respectively. One way a triploid cell may be produced is by the fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg produced by nondisjunction of all its chromosomes. An example of an accident that would result in tetraploidy is the failure of a 2n zygote to divide after replicating its chromosomes. Subsequent mitosis would then produce a 4n embryo.

Polyploidy is relatively common in the plant kingdom, and we will see in Chapter 24 that the spontaneous origin of polyploid individuals plays an important role in the evolution of plants. In the animal kingdom, polyploid species are much less common, although they are known to occur among the fishes and amphibians. Recently, researchers in Chile have identified the first mammalian candidate for polyploidy, a rodent (Tympanoctomys barrerae) whose cells seem to be tetraploid (FIGURE 15.12). In general, polyploids are more nearly normal in appearance than aneuploids. One extra (or missing) chromosome apparently disrupts genetic balance more than does an entire extra set of chromosomes.

Fig 15-12. A tetraploid mammal? The somatic cells of this red viscacha rat from Argentina, Tympanoctomys barrerae, have about twice as many chromosomes as those of closely related species. (Interestingly, its sperm's head is unusually large, presumably a necessity for holding all that genetic material.) Scientists think that this rat may be a tetraploid species that arose when an ancestor somehow doubled its chromosome number, presumably by errors in mitosis or meiosis within the animal's reproductive organs. Researchers are studying the rat's chromosomes to determine if it actually has four homologous sets.

Alterations of Chromosome Structure

Breakage of a chromosome can lead to four types of changes in chromosome structure. A deletion occurs when a chromosomal fragment lacking a centromere is lost during cell division. The chromosome from which the fragment originated will then be missing certain genes. In some cases, if meiosis is in progress, such a fragment may become attached as an extra segment to a sister chromatid, producing a duplication in the recipient chromosome. (Alternatively, a detached fragment could produce a duplication by attaching to a homologous chromosome, but in that case, the "duplicated" pieces of chromosome might not be identical.) A chromosomal fragment may also reattach to the original chromosome but in the reverse orientation, producing an inversion. A fourth possible result of chromosomal breakage is for the fragment to join a nonhomologous chromosome, a rearrangement called a translocation. FIGURE 15.13 illustrates these different types of structural alterations of chromosomes.

Fig 15-13. Alterations of chromosome structure. Vertical arrows indicate points of chromosome breakage. Dark purple highlights the chromosomal parts affected by the rearrangements.

Deletions and duplications are especially likely to occur during meiosis. Homologous (nonsister) chromatids sometimes break and rejoin at "incorrect" places, so that one partner gives up more genes than it receives. The products of such a nonreciprocal crossover are one chromosome with a deletion and one chromosome with a duplication.

A diploid embryo that is homozygous for a large deletion (or has a single X chromosome with a large deletion, in a male) is usually missing a number of essential genes, a condition that is ordinarily lethal. Duplications and translocations also tend to have harmful effects. In reciprocal translocations, in which segments are exchanged between nonhomologous chromosomes, and in inversions, the balance of genes is not abnormal--all genes are present in their normal doses. Nevertheless, inversions and translocations can alter phenotype because a gene's expression can be influenced by its location among neighboring genes.

Human Disorders Due to Chromosomal Alterations

Alterations of chromosome number and structure are associated with a number of serious human disorders. When nondisjunction occurs in meiosis, the result is aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes in the gamete produced and, later, in the zygote. Although the frequency of aneuploid zygotes may be quite high in humans, most of these chromosomal alterations are so disastrous to development that the embryos are spontaneously (naturally) aborted long before birth. However, some types of aneuploidy appear to upset the genetic balance less than others, with the result that individuals with certain aneuploid conditions can survive to birth and beyond. These individuals have a set of symptoms--a syndrome--characteristic of the type of aneuploidy. Genetic disorders caused by aneuploidy can be diagnosed before birth by fetal testing (p. 265).

One aneuploid condition, Down syndrome, affects approximately one out of every 700 children born in the United States. Down syndrome is usually the result of an extra chromosome 21, so that each body cell has a total of 47 chromosomes (FIGURE 15.14). In chromosomal terms, the cells are trisomic for chromosome 21. Although chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, its trisomy severely alters the individual's phenotype. Down syndrome includes characteristic facial features, short stature, heart defects, susceptibility to respiratory infection, and mental retardation. Furthermore, individuals with Down syndrome are prone to developing leukemia and Alzheimer's disease. (It is probably not a coincidence that certain genes associated with the latter two diseases are located on chromosome 21.) Although people with Down syndrome, on average, have a life span shorter than normal, some live to middle age or beyond. Most are sexually underdeveloped and sterile. Most cases of Down syndrome result from nondisjunction during gamete production in one of the parents.

Fig 15-14. Down syndrome. The karyotype shows trisomy 21. The child exhibits the facial features characteristic of Down syndrome.

The frequency of Down syndrome correlates with the age of the mother. Down syndrome occurs in 0.04%  of children born to women under age 30. The risk climbs to 1.25%  for mothers in their early 30s and is even higher for older mothers. Because of this relatively high risk, pregnant women over 35 are candidates for fetal testing to check for trisomy 21 in the embryo. The correlation of Down syndrome with maternal age has not yet been explained. Most cases result from nondisjunction during meiosis I, and recent research suggests the involvement of some age-dependent abnormality in the spindle checkpoint, which delays anaphase until all the kinetochores are attached to the spindle (like the M-phase checkpoint of the mitotic cell cycle; see Chapter 12). Trisomies of other chromosomes also increase in incidence with maternal age, although infants with autosomal trisomies rarely survive for long.

Nondisjunction of sex chromosomes produces a variety of aneuploid conditions in humans. Most of these conditions appear to upset genetic balance less than aneuploid conditions involving autosomes. This may be because the Y chromosome carries relatively few genes and because extra copies of the X chromosome become inactivated as Barr bodies in the somatic cells.

An extra X chromosome in a male, producing XXY, occurs approximately once in every 2,000 live births. People with this disorder, called Klinefelter syndrome, have male sex organs, but the testes are abnormally small and the man is sterile. The syndrome often includes breast enlargement and other feminine body characteristics. The affected individual is usually of normal intelligence. Males with an extra Y chromosome (XYY) are not characterized by any well-defined syndrome, although they tend to be somewhat taller than average. Females with trisomy X (XXX), which occurs once in approximately 1,000 live births, are healthy and cannot be distinguished from XX females except by karyotype. Monosomy X, called Turner syndrome, occurs about once in every 5,000 births and is the only known viable monosomy in humans. Although these X0 individuals are phenotypically female, their sex organs do not mature at adolescence, and they are sterile. However, when provided with estrogen replacement therapy, girls with Turner syndrome do develop secondary sex characteristics. Most have normal intelligence.

Even if chromosome number is normal, structural alterations of chromosomes can cause human disorders. Many deletions in human chromosomes (see FIGURE 15.13a), even in a heterozygous state, cause severe physical and mental problems. One such syndrome is known as cri du chat ("cry of the cat"). A child born with this specific deletion in chromosome 5 is mentally retarded, has a small head with unusual facial features, and has a cry that sounds like the mewing of a distressed cat. Such individuals usually die in infancy or early childhood.

Another type of chromosomal structural alteration associated with human disorders is chromosomal translocation, the attachment of a fragment from one chromosome to another, nonhomologous chromosome (see FIGURE 15.13d). Chromosomal translocations have been implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Leukemia is a cancer affecting the cells that give rise to white blood cells, and in the cancerous cells of CML patients, a reciprocal translocation has occurred. A portion of chromosome 22 has switched places with a small fragment from a tip of chromosome 9. (How such a switch might cause cancer will be discussed in Chapter 19.)

A small fraction of individuals with Down syndrome have a chromosomal translocation of a different sort. All the cells of such people have the normal number of chromosomes, 46. Close inspection of the karyotype, however, shows the presence of part or all of a third chromosome 21 attached to an other chromosome by translocation.





 The phenotypic effects of some mammaliangenes depend on whether they were inheritedfrom the mother or the father (imprinting)

Throughout our discussions of Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal basis of inheritance, we have assumed that a specific allele will have the same effect regardless of whether it was inherited from the mother or the father. This is probably a safe assumption most of the time. For example, when Mendel crossed purple-flowered peas with white-flowered peas, he observed the same results regardless of whether the purple-flowered parent supplied the ova or pollen. In recent years, however, geneticists have identified some traits in mammals, including certain inherited disorders in humans, that depend on which parent passed along the alleles for those traits. (Note that the issue here is not sex linkage; the genes involved may or may not lie on the X chromosome.)

Consider the two disorders called Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. The symptoms are different. Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, obesity, short stature, and unusually small hands and feet. People with Angelman syndrome exhibit spontaneous (uncontrollable) laughter, jerky movements, and other motor and mental symptoms. For both disorders, the genetic cause seems to be the same: deletion of a particular segment of chromosome 15. If a child inherits the abnormal chromosome from the father, the result is Prader-Willi syndrome. If the abnormal chromosome is inherited from the mother, the result is Angelman syndrome. It appears that the genes of the deleted region normally behave differently in offspring, depending on whether they belong to the maternal or the paternal chromosome.

A process called genomic imprinting can explain the Prader-Willi/Angelman enigma and some similar phenomena. In this process, a gene on one chromosome is somehow silenced, while its allele on the homologous chromosome is left free to be expressed. In mammals, certain genes are imprinted in some way in each generation, with the imprinting status of a given gene depending on whether the gene resides in a female or in a male (FIGURE 15.15). In other words, the same alleles may have different effects on offspring, depending on whether they arrive in the zygote via the ovum or via the sperm. In the new generation, both maternal and paternal imprints are apparently "erased" in gamete-producing cells, and all the chromosomes are reimprinted according to the sex of the individual in which they now reside.

Fig 15-15. Genomic imprinting. The sperm and ova of mammals convey chromosomes that are differently imprinted. The phenotypic effect of a particular allele in an offspring may therefore depend on whether the allele came from the mother or the father. In each generation, the old imprints are "erased" when sperm or ova are produced, and all the chromosomes are newly imprinted according to the sex of the individual.

What exactly is a genomic imprint? In many cases, it seems to consist of methyl (--CH3) groups that are added to cytosine nucleotides of one of the alleles. The hypothesis that this methylation directly silences the allele is consistent with evidence that heavily methylated genes are usually inactive (see p. 363) and suggests that in these cases, the animal uses the allele that is not imprinted. But in other cases of imprinting, the absence of methylation in the vicinity of an allele plays a role in silencing it, whereas methylation does occur near the active allele on the homologous chromosome. Researchers are trying to work out the mechanisms involved.

Researchers have so far identified about 20 mammalian genes subject to imprinting, and there may be a couple of hundred more. Most of the known imprinted genes are critical for embryonic development. In experiments with mice, embryos engineered to inherit both copies of certain chromosomes from the same parent inevitably die before birth, whether that parent is male or female. Normal development apparently requires that certain genes have exactly one active copy--not zero, not two.

In humans, in addition to the Prader-Willi/Angelman case, genomic imprinting may help explain the inheritance pattern of other disorders, including one called fragile X syndrome. This disorder is named for the physical appearance of an abnormal X chromosome, the tip of which hangs on to the rest of the chromosome by a thin thread of DNA. Children with fragile X syndrome--about one in every 1,500 males and one in every 2,500 females--are mentally retarded. Of all forms of mental retardation with a genetic basis, fragile X is the most common.

Inheritance of fragile X has a complex pattern, but the syndrome is more common when the abnormal chromosome is inherited from the mother rather than the father. This is consistent with the disorder being more common in males: If a male (XY) inherits a fragile X chromosome, it has to be from his mother. The fragile X case is one in which imprinting (methylation) of the abnormal allele by the mother somehow causes (rather than "silences") the syndrome. An unusual molecular characteristic of this abnormal allele will be described in Chapter 19.





 Extranuclear genes exhibit a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance

Although our focus in this chapter has been on the chromosomal basis of inheritance, we end with an important amendment: Not all of a eukaryotic cell's genes are located on nuclear chromosomes, or even in the nucleus. Extranuclear genes are found on small circles of DNA in mitochondria and in plants' plastids, including chloroplasts. Both mitochondria and plastids reproduce themselves and transmit their genes to daughter organelles. These cytoplasmic genes do not display Mendelian inheritance because they are not distributed to offspring according to the same rules that direct the distribution of nuclear chromosomes during meiosis.

Cytoplasmic genes were first observed in plants. In 1909, Karl Correns studied the inheritance of yellow or white patches on the leaves of an otherwise green plant. He found that the coloration of the offspring was determined only by the maternal parent (the source of seeds that germinate to give rise to the offspring) and not by the paternal parent (the pollen source). Subsequent research has shown that such coloration patterns are due to genes in the plastids that control pigmentation. In most plants, a zygote receives all its plastids from the cytoplasm of the ovum and none from pollen. Thus, as the zygote of these plants develops, its pattern of leaf coloration depends only on maternal plastid genes (FIGURE 15.16).

Fig 15-16. Cytoplasmic inheritance in tomato leaves. Variegated (striped or spotted) leaves result from genes located in the plastids rather than on the nuclear chromosomes of plant cells. Because only the ovum contributes plastids to a plant zygote, all plastid genes are inherited from the maternal parent.

Maternal inheritance is also the rule for the mitochondrial genes in mammals, because the mitochondria passed on by the zygote all come from the cytoplasm of the ovum. In recent years, scientists have learned that mutations in mitochondrial DNA cause a number of rare human disorders. The products of most mitochondrial genes help make up the protein complexes of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase (see Chapter 9). Defects in one or more of these proteins therefore reduce the amount of ATP the cell can make. The parts of the body most susceptible to energy deprivation are the nervous system and the muscles, and most mitochondrial diseases affect these systems. For example, a person with the disease called mitochondrial myopathy suffers weakness, intolerance of exercise, and muscle deterioration.

In addition to the rare diseases clearly caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial mutations inherited from a person's mother may contribute to at least some cases of diabetes and heart disease, as well as to other disorders that commonly debilitate the elderly, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the course of a lifetime, new mutations gradually accumulate in our mitochondrial DNA, and some researchers believe that these play a role in the normal aging process.

Wherever genes are located in the cell--nucleus or cytoplasm--their inheritance depends on the precise replication of DNA, the genetic material. In the next chapter, you will learn how this molecular reproduction occurs.

In April 1963, James Watson and Francis Crick shook the scientific world with an elegant double-helical model for the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The photograph on this page captures Watson and Crick admiring their DNA model. DNA, the substance of inheritance, is the most celebrated molecule of our time. Mendel's heritable factors and Morgan's genes on chromosomes are, in fact, composed of DNA. Chemically speaking, your genetic endowment is the DNA you inherited from your parents.

Of all nature's molecules, nucleic acids are unique in their ability to direct their own replication. Indeed, the resemblance of offspring to their parents has its basis in the precise replication of DNA and its transmission from one generation to the next. In other words, DNA is the substance behind the adage "Like begets like." Hereditary information is encoded in the chemical language of DNA and reproduced in all the cells of your body. It is this DNA program that directs the development of your biochemical, anatomical, physiological, and, to some extent, behavioral traits. In this chapter, you will learn how biologists deduced that DNA is the genetic material, how Watson and Crick discovered its structure, and how cells replicate and repair their DNA--the molecular basis of inheritance.

Today, even schoolchildren have heard of DNA, and scientists routinely manipulate DNA in the laboratory and use it to change the heritable characteristics of cells. Early in the 20th century, however, the identification of the molecules of inheritance loomed as a major challenge to biologists.

The relationship between structure and function, one of the themes of biology, is manifest in the double helix. The idea that there is specific pairing of nitrogenous bases in DNA was the flash of inspiration that led Watson and Crick to the correct double helix. At the same time, they saw the functional significance of the base-pairing rules. They ended their classic paper with this wry statement: "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." In the next section, you will learn about this basic mechanism of DNA replication. Some important details of the process will be presented in the section that follows.





 The search for the genetic material led to DNA

Once T. H. Morgan's group showed that genes are located on chromosomes, the two chemical components of chromosomes--DNA and protein--became the candidates for the genetic material. Until the 1940s, the case for proteins seemed stronger, especially since biochemists had identified them as a class of macromolecules with great heterogeneity and specificity of function, essential requirements for the hereditary material. Moreover, little was known about nucleic acids, whose physical and chemical properties seemed far too uniform to account for the multitude of specific inherited traits exhibited by every organism. This view gradually changed, as experiments with micro-organisms yielded unexpected results. As with the work of Mendel and Morgan, a key factor in determining the identity of the genetic material was the choice of appropriate experimental organisms. Bacteria and the viruses that infect them are far simpler than pea plants, fruit flies, or humans, and the role of DNA in heredity was first worked out by studying such microbes. In this section, we will trace the search for the genetic material in some detail as a case study of the scientific process.

Evidence That DNA Can Transform Bacteria

We can trace the discovery of the genetic role of DNA back to 1928. Frederick Griffith, a British medical officer, was studying Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes pneumonia in mammals. Griffith had two strains (varieties) of the bacterium, a pathogenic (disease-causing) one and a variant that was harmless. He was surprised to find that when he killed the pathogenic bacteria with heat and then mixed the cell remains with living bacteria of the harmless strain, some of the living cells were converted to the pathogenic form (FIGURE 16.1). Furthermore, this new trait of pathogenicity was inherited by all the descendants of the transformed bacteria. Clearly, some chemical component of the dead pathogenic cells caused this heritable change, although the identity of the substance was not known. Griffith called the phenomenon transformation, now defined as a change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA by a cell. (This usage of transformation should not be confused with the conversion of a normal animal cell to a cancerous one, discussed in Chapter 12.

Fig 16-1. Transformation of bacteria. The S strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia; the R strain is nonpathogenic. Griffith discovered that a mixture of heat killed S cells and live R cells killed mice and that live S bacteria could be retrieved from the dead mice. He concluded that molecules from the dead S cells had genetically transformed living R bacteria into S bacteria.

Griffith's work set the stage for a 14-year search for the identity of the transforming substance by American bacteriologist Oswald Avery. Avery purified various chemicals from the heat-killed pathogenic bacteria, then tried to transform live nonpathogenic bacteria with each chemical. Only DNA worked. Finally, in 1944, Avery and his colleagues Maclyn McCarty and Colin MacLeod announced that the transforming agent was DNA. Their discovery was greeted with considerable skepticism, in part because of the lingering belief that proteins were better candidates for the genetic material. Moreover, many biologists were not convinced that the genes of bacteria would be similar in composition and function to those of more complex organisms. But the major reason for the continued doubt was that so little was known about DNA. No one could imagine how DNA could carry genetic information.

Evidence That Viral DNA Can Program Cells

Additional evidence for DNA as the genetic material came from studies of a virus that infects bacteria. Viruses are much simpler than cells. A virus is little more than DNA (or sometimes RNA) enclosed by a protective coat of protein. To reproduce, a virus must infect a cell and take over the cell's metabolic machinery.

Viruses that infect bacteria are widely used as research tools in molecular genetics. These viruses are called bacteriophages (meaning "bacteria eaters"), or just phages. In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase performed experiments showing that DNA is the genetic material of a phage known as T2. This is one of many phages that infect Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterium that normally lives in the intestines of mammals. At that time, biologists already knew that T2, like many other viruses, was composed almost entirely of DNA and protein. They also knew that the phage could quickly turn an E. coli cell into a T2-producing factory that released phages when the cell ruptured. Somehow, T2 could reprogram its host cell to produce viruses. But which viral component--protein or DNA--was responsible?

Hershey and Chase answered this question by devising an experiment showing that only one of the two components of T2 actually enters the E. coli cell during infection (FIGURE 16.2). In preparation for their experiment, they used different radioactive isotopes to tag phage DNA and protein. First, they grew T2 with E. coli in the presence of radioactive sulfur. Because protein, but not DNA, contains sulfur, the radioactive atoms were incorporated only into the protein of the phage. Next, in a similar way, the DNA of a separate batch of phage was labeled with atoms of radioactive phosphorus; because nearly all the phage's phosphorus is in its DNA, this procedure left the phage protein unlabeled. In the experiment, the protein-labeled and DNA-labeled batches of T2 were each allowed to infect separate samples of nonradioactive E. coli cells. Shortly after the onset of infection, the cultures were whirled in a kitchen blender to shake loose any parts of the phages that remained outside the bacterial cells. The mixtures were then spun in a centrifuge, forcing the bacterial cells to form a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, but allowing free phages and parts of phages, which are lighter, to remain suspended in the liquid, or supernatant. The scientists then measured the radioactivity in the pellet and in the supernatant.

Fig 16-2. The Hershey-Chase experiment. In their famous 1952 experiment, Hershey and Chase demonstrated that DNA, not protein, functions as the T2 phage's genetic material.

Hershey and Chase found that when the bacteria had been infected with the T2 phage containing radioactively labeled proteins, most of the radioactivity was found in the supernatant, which contained phage particles (but not bacteria). This result suggested that the protein of the phage did not enter the host cells. But when the bacteria had been infected with T2 phage whose DNA was tagged with radioactive phosphorus, then the pellet of mainly bacterial material contained most of the radio-activity. Moreover, when these bacteria were returned to a culture medium, the infection ran its course, and the E. coli released phages that contained some radioactive phosphorus.

Hershey and Chase concluded that the DNA of the virus is injected into the host cell during infection, leaving the protein outside. The injected DNA provides genetic information that makes the cells produce new viral DNA and proteins, which assemble into new viruses. Thus, the Hershey-Chase experiment provided powerful evidence that nucleic acids, rather than proteins, are the hereditary material, at least for viruses.

Additional Evidence That DNA Is the Genetic Material of Cells

Additional circumstantial evidence pointed to DNA as the genetic material in eukaryotes. Prior to mitosis, a eukaryotic cell exactly doubles its DNA content, and during mitosis, this DNA is distributed exactly equally to the two daughter cells. Also, diploid sets of chromosomes have twice as much DNA as the haploid sets found in the gametes of the same organism.

Still more evidence came from the laboratory of biochemist Erwin Chargaff. It was already known that DNA is a polymer of nucleotides, each consisting of three components: a nitrogenous (nitrogen-containing) base, a pentose sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. (See FIGURE 16.3 for review.) The base can be adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). Chargaff analyzed the base composition of DNA from a number of different organisms. In 1947, he reported that DNA composition varies from one species to another: In the DNA of any one species, the amounts of the four nitrogenous bases are not all equal but are present in a characteristic ratio. Such evidence of molecular diversity, which had been presumed absent from DNA, made DNA a more credible candidate for the genetic material.

Fig 16-3. The structure of a DNA strand. Each nucleotide unit of the polynucleotide chain consists of a nitrogenous base (T, A, C, or G), the sugar deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The phosphate of one nucleotide is attached to the sugar of the next nucleotide in line. The result is a "backbone" of alternating phosphates and sugars, from which the bases project.

Chargaff also found a peculiar regularity in the ratios of nucleotide bases. In the DNA of each species he studied, the number of adenines approximately equaled the number of thymines, and the number of guanines approximately equaled the number of cytosines. In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these percentages: A = 30.9%  and T = 29.4% ; G = 19.9%  and C = 19.8% . The A = T and G = C equalities, later known as Chargaff's rules, remained unexplained until the discovery of the double helix.





 Watson and Crick discovered the double helix by building models to conform to X-ray data

Once most biologists were convinced that DNA was the genetic material, the challenge was to determine how the structure of DNA could account for its role in inheritance. By the beginning of the 1950s, the arrangement of covalent bonds in a nucleic acid polymer was well established (FIGURE 16.3), and researchers focused on discovering the three-dimensional structure of DNA. Among the scientists working on the problem were Linus Pauling, in California, and Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, in London. First to come up with the correct answer, however, were two scientists who were relatively unknown at the time--the American James Watson and the Englishman Francis Crick.

The brief but celebrated partnership that solved the DNA puzzle began soon after the young Watson journeyed to Cambridge University, where Crick was studying protein structure with a technique called X-ray crystallography (see FIGURE 5.27). While visiting the laboratory of Maurice Wilkins at King's College in London, Watson saw an X-ray diffraction image of DNA produced by Wilkins's colleague, Rosalind Franklin (FIGURE 16.4a). Images produced by X-ray crystallography are not actually pictures of molecules. The spots and smudges in FIGURE 16.4b were produced by X-rays that were diffracted (deflected) as they passed through aligned fibers of purified DNA. Crystallographers use mathematical equations to translate such patterns of spots into information about the three-dimensional shapes of molecules, and Watson was familiar with the types of patterns that helical molecules produce. Just a glance at Franklin's X-ray diffraction photo of DNA not only told him that DNA was helical in shape but also enabled him to deduce the width of the helix and the spacing of the nitrogenous bases along it. The width of the helix suggested that it was made up of two strands, contrary to a three-stranded model that Linus Pauling had recently proposed. The presence of two strands accounts for the now-familiar term double helix.

Fig 16-4. Rosalind Franklin and her X-ray diffraction photo of DNA. Franklin, an X-ray crystallographer, took the photo that Watson and Crick used in deducing the double-helical structure of DNA. Franklin died of cancer when she was only 38. Her colleague, Maurice Wilkins, received the Nobel Prize in 1962 along with Watson and Crick. Because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously, science historians can only speculate about whether the committee would have recognized Franklin's contribution to the discovery of the double helix. (a) Rosalind Franklin (b) Franklin's X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA

Using molecular models made of wire, Watson and Crick began building models of a double helix that would conform to the X-ray measurements and what was then known about the chemistry of DNA. After failing to make a satisfactory model that placed the sugar-phosphate chains on the inside of the molecule, Watson tried putting them on the outside and forcing the nitrogenous bases to swivel to the interior of the double helix (FIGURE 16.5). Imagine this double helix as a rope ladder having rigid rungs, with the ladder twisted into a spiral. The side ropes are the equivalent of the sugar-phosphate backbones, and the rungs represent pairs of nitrogenous bases. Franklin's X-ray data indicated that the helix makes one full turn every 3.4 nm along its length. With the bases stacked just 0.34 nm apart, there are ten layers of base pairs, or rungs on the ladder, in each turn of the helix. This arrangement was appealing because it put the relatively hydrophobic nitrogenous bases in the molecule's interior and thus away from the surrounding aqueous medium.

Fig 16-5. The double helix. (a) The "ribbons" in this diagram represent the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands. The helix is "right-handed," curving up to the right. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds (dotted lines) between the nitrogenous bases, which are paired in the interior of the double helix. (b) For clarity, the two DNA strands are shown untwisted in this partial chemical structure. Notice that the strands are oriented in opposite directions. (c) The tight stacking of the base pairs is clear in this computer model. Van der Waals attractions between the stacked pairs play a major role in holding the molecule together.

The nitrogenous bases of the double helix are paired in specific combinations: adenine (A) with thymine (T), and guanine (G) with cytosine (C). It was mainly by trial and error that Watson and Crick arrived at this key feature of DNA. At first, Watson imagined that the bases paired like-with-like--for example, A with A and C with C. But this model did not fit the X-ray data, which suggested that the double helix had a uniform diameter. Why is this requirement inconsistent with like-with-like pairing of bases? Adenine and guanine are purines, nitrogenous bases with two organic rings. In contrast, cytosine and thymine belong to the family of nitrogenous bases known as pyrimidines, which have a single ring. Thus, purines (A and G) are about twice as wide as pyrimidines (C and T). A purine-purine pair is too wide and a pyrimidine-pyrimidine pair too narrow to account for the 2-nm diameter of the double helix. The solution is to always pair a purine with a pyrimidine:

Watson and Crick reasoned that there must be additional specificity of pairing dictated by the structure of the bases. Each base has chemical side groups that can form hydrogen bonds with its appropriate partner: Adenine can form two hydrogen bonds with thymine and only thymine; guanine forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine and only cytosine. In shorthand, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C (FIGURE 16.6).

Fig 16-6. Base pairing in DNA. The pairs of nitrogenous bases in a DNA double helix are held together by hydrogen bonds as shown here.

The Watson-Crick model explained Chargaff's rules. Wherever one strand of a DNA molecule has an A, the partner strand has a T. And a G in one strand is always paired with a C in the complementary strand. Therefore, in the DNA of any organism, the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of guanine equals the amount of cytosine. Although the base-pairing rules dictate the combinations of nitrogenous bases that form the "rungs" of the double helix, they do not restrict the sequence of nucleotides along each DNA strand. The linear sequence of the four bases can be varied in countless ways, and each gene has a unique order, or base sequence.

In April 1953, Watson and Crick surprised the scientific world with a succinct, one-page paper in the British journal Nature.* The paper reported their molecular model for DNA: the double helix, which has since become the symbol of molecular biology. The beauty of the model was that its structure suggested the basic mechanism of DNA replication.





 During DNA replication, base pairing enables existing DNA strands to serve as templates for new complementary strands

In a second paper that followed their announcement of the double helix, Watson and Crick stated their hypothesis for how DNA replicates:

Now our model for deoxyribonucleic acid is, in effect, a pair of templates, each of which is complementary to the other. We imagine that prior to duplication the hydrogen bonds are broken, and the two chains unwind and separate. Each chain then acts as a template for the formation onto itself of a new companion chain, so that eventually we shall have two pairs of chains, where we only had one before. Moreover, the sequence of the pairs of bases will have been duplicated exactly.*

FIGURE 16.7 illustrates Watson and Crick's basic idea. To make it easier to follow, the diagram shows only a short section of double helix, in untwisted form. Notice that if you cover one of the two DNA strands of FIGURE 16.7a, you can still determine its linear sequence of bases by referring to the unmasked strand and applying the base-pairing rules. The two strands are complementary; each stores the information necessary to reconstruct the other. When a cell copies a DNA molecule, each strand serves as a template (mold) for ordering nucleotides into a new complementary strand. One at a time, nucleotides line up along the template strand according to the base-pairing rules. The nucleotides are linked to form the new strands. Where there was one double-stranded DNA molecule at the beginning of the process, there are now two, each an exact replica of the "parent" molecule. The copying mechanism is analogous to using a photographic negative to make a positive image, which can in turn be used to make another negative, and so on. (See FIGURE 5.30 for a helical version of FIGURE 16.7.)

Fig 16-7. A model for DNA replication: the basic concept. In this simplification, a short segment of DNA has been untwisted into a structure that resembles a ladder. The rails of the ladder are the sugar-phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands; the rungs are the pairs of nitrogenous bases. Simple shapes symbolize the four kinds of bases. Dark blue represents DNA strands originally present in the parent cell; light blue represents newly synthesized DNA.

This model of gene replication remained untested for several years following publication of the DNA structure. The requisite experiments were simple in concept but difficult to perform. Watson and Crick's model predicts that when a double helix replicates, each of the two daughter molecules will have one old strand, derived from the parent molecule, and one newly made strand. This semiconservative model can be distinguished from a conservative model of replication, in which the parent molecule somehow emerges from the replication process intact (that is, it is conserved). In yet a third model, called the dispersive model, all four strands of DNA following replication have a mixture of old and new DNA (FIGURE 16.8, p. 294). Although mechanisms for conservative or dispersive DNA replication are not easy to devise, these models remained possibilities until they could be ruled out. Finally, in the late 1950s, Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl devised experiments that tested the three hypotheses. Their experiments supported the semiconservative model, as predicted by Watson and Crick (FIGURE 16.9, p. 294).

Fig 16-9. The Meselson-Stahl experiment tested three models of DNA replication. Meselson and Stahl cultured E. coli bacteria for several generations on a medium containing a heavy isotope of nitrogen, 15N. The bacteria incorporated the heavy nitrogen into their nucleotides and then into their DNA. The scientists then transferred the bacteria to a medium containing 14N, the lighter, more common isotope of nitrogen. Any new DNA that the bacteria synthesized would be lighter than the "old" DNA made in the 15N medium. Meselson and Stahl could distinguish DNA of different densities by centrifuging DNA extracted from the bacteria. The centrifuge tubes in this drawing represent the results predicted by each of the three models in FIGURE 16.8. The first replication in the 14N medium produced a band of hybrid (15N-14N) DNA. This result eliminated the conservative model. A second replication produced both light and hybrid DNA, a result that eliminated the dispersive model and supported the semiconservative model.

The basic principle of DNA replication is elegantly simple. However, the actual process involves complex biochemical gymnastics, as we will now see.





 A large team of enzymes and other proteins carries out DNA replication

The bacterium E. coli has a single chromosome of about 5 million base pairs. In a favorable environment, an E. coli cell can copy all this DNA and divide to form two genetically identical daughter cells in less than an hour. Each of your cells has 46 DNA molecules in its nucleus, one giant molecule per chromosome. In all, that represents about 6 billion base pairs, or over a thousand times more DNA than is found in a bacterial cell. If we were to print the one-letter symbols for these bases (A, G, C, and T) the size of the letters you are now reading, the 6 billion bases of a single human cell would fill about 900 books as thick as this text. Yet it takes a cell just a few hours to copy all this DNA. This replication of an enormous amount of genetic information is achieved with very few errors--only one per billion nucleotides. The copying of DNA is remarkable in its speed and accuracy.

More than a dozen enzymes and other proteins participate in DNA replication. Much more is known about how this "replication machine" works in bacteria than in eukaryotes. However, most of the process seems to be fundamentally similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In this section, we take a closer look at the basic steps.

Getting Started: Origins of Replication

The replication of a DNA molecule begins at special sites called origins of replication. The bacterial chromosome, which is circular, has a single origin, a stretch of DNA having a specific sequence of nucleotides. Proteins that initiate DNA replication recognize this sequence and attach to the DNA, separating the two strands and opening up a replication "bubble." Replication of DNA then proceeds in both directions, until the entire molecule is copied (see FIGURE 18.11). In contrast to the bacterial chromosome, a eukaryotic chromosome may have hundreds or even thousands of replication origins. Multiple replication bubbles form and eventually fuse, thus speeding up the copying of the very long DNA molecules (FIGURE 16.10). As in bacteria, DNA replication proceeds in both directions from each origin. At each end of a replication bubble is a replication fork, a Y-shaped region where the new strands of DNA are elongating.

Fig 16-10. Origins of replication in eukaryotes.

Elongating a New DNA Strand

Elongation of new DNA at a replication fork is catalyzed by enzymes called DNA polymerases. As nucleotides align with complementary bases along a template strand of DNA, they are added by polymerase, one by one, to the growing end of the new DNA strand. The rate of elongation is about 500 nucleotides per second in bacteria and 50 per second in human cells.

What is the source of energy that drives the polymerization of nucleotides to form new DNA strands? The nucleotides that serve as substrates for DNA polymerase are actually nucleo side triphosphates, which are nucleotides with three phosphate groups (FIGURE 16.11, p. 296). You have already encountered such a molecule--ATP. The only difference between the ATP of energy metabolism and the nucleoside triphosphate that supplies adenine to DNA is the sugar component, which is deoxyribose in the building block of DNA, but ribose in ATP. (As you might guess, ribose-containing ATP is a substrate for RNA synthesis.) Like ATP, the triphosphate monomers used for DNA synthesis are chemically reactive, partly because their triphosphate tails have an unstable cluster of negative charge. As each monomer joins the growing end of a DNA strand, it loses two phosphate groups as a molecule of pyrophosphate P - Pi). Subsequent hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate to two molecules of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is the exergonic reaction that drives the polymerization reaction.

Fig 16-11. Incorporation of a nucleotide into a DNA strand. When a nucleoside triphosphate links to the sugar-phosphate backbone of a growing DNA strand, it loses two of its phosphates as a pyrophosphate molecule. The enzyme catalyzing the reaction is a DNA polymerase, and hydrolysis of the bonds between the phosphate groups of the pyrophosphate provides the energy for the reaction.

The Antiparallel Arrangement of the DNA Strands

There is more to the scenario of DNA synthesis at the replication fork. Until now, we have ignored an important feature of the double helix: The two DNA strands are antiparallel; that is, their sugar-phosphate backbones run in opposite directions. In FIGURE 16.12, the five carbons of one deoxyribose sugar of each DNA strand are numbered from 1&#39; to 5&#39;. (The prime sign is used to distinguish the carbon atoms of the sugar from the carbon and nitrogen atoms of the nitrogenous bases.) Notice in FIGURE 16.12 that a nucleotide's phosphate group is attached to the 5&#39; carbon of deoxyribose. Notice also that the phosphate group of one nucleotide is joined to the 3&#39; carbon of the adjacent nucleotide. The result is a DNA strand of distinct polarity. At one end, denoted the 3&#39; end, a hydroxyl group is attached to the 3&#39; carbon of the terminal deoxyribose. At the opposite end, the 5&#39; end, the sugar-phosphate backbone terminates with the phosphate group attached to the 5&#39; carbon of the last nucleotide. In the double helix, the two sugar-phosphate backbones are essentially upside down (antiparallel) relative to each other.

Fig 16-12. The two strands of DNA are antiparallel. The 5&#39; 3&#39; direction of one strand runs counter to the 5&#39; 3&#39; direction of the other strand. The numbers assigned to the carbon atoms of the deoxyribose units are shown for two of them.

How does the antiparallel structure of the double helix affect replication? DNA polymerases add nucleotides only to the free 3&#39; end of a growing DNA strand, never to the 5&#39; end. Thus, a new DNA strand can elongate only in the 5&#39; 3&#39; direction. With this in mind, let's examine a replication fork (FIGURE 16.13). Along one template strand, DNA polymerase can synthesize a continuous complementary strand by elongating the new DNA in the mandatory 5&#39; 3&#39; direction. The polymerase simply nestles in the replication fork on that template strand and continuously adds nucleotides to a complementary strand as the fork progresses. The DNA strand made by this mechanism is called the leading strand.

Fig 16-13. Synthesis of leading and lagging strands during DNA replication.

To elongate the other new strand of DNA, polymerase must work along the other template strand in the direction away from the replication fork. The DNA synthesized in this direction is called the lagging strand. The process is analogous to a sewing method called backstitching. As a replication bubble opens, a polymerase molecule can work its way away from a replication fork and synthesize a short segment of DNA. As the bubble grows, another short segment of the lagging strand can be made in a similar way. In contrast to the leading strand, which elongates continuously, the lagging strand is first synthesized as a series of segments. These pieces are called Okazaki fragments, after the Japanese scientist who discovered them. The fragments are about 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes. Another enzyme, DNA ligase, joins (ligates) the sugar-phosphate backbones of the Okazaki fragments to create a single DNA strand.

Priming DNA Synthesis

There is another important restriction for DNA polymerases. None of these enzymes can actually initiate synthesis of a polynucleotide; they can only add nucleotides to the end of an already existing chain that is base-paired with the template strand (see FIGURE 16.11). In the replication of cellular DNA, the start of a new chain, its primer, is not DNA, but a short stretch of RNA, the other class of nucleic acid. An enzyme called primase joins RNA nucleotides to make the primer, which is about 10 nucleotides long in eukaryotes (FIGURE 16.14). (Like all RNA-synthesizing enzymes, primase can start an RNA chain from scratch.) Another DNA polymerase later replaces the RNA nucleotides of the primers with DNA versions. Only one primer is required for a DNA polymerase to begin synthesizing the leading strand of new DNA. For the lagging strand, each Okazaki fragment must be primed; the primers are converted to DNA before ligase joins the fragments together.

Fig 16-14. Priming DNA synthesis with RNA. DNA polymerase cannot initiate a polynucleotide strand; it can only add to the 3&#39; end of an already-started strand. The primer is a short segment of RNA synthesized by the enzyme primase. Each primer is eventually replaced by DNA.

Other Proteins Assisting DNA Replication

You have learned about three kinds of proteins that function in DNA synthesis: DNA polymerase, ligase, and primase. Other kinds of proteins also participate; two of these are helicase and single-strand binding protein. A helicase is an enzyme that untwists the double helix at the replication fork, separating the two old strands. Molecules of single-strand binding protein then line up along the unpaired DNA strands, holding them apart while they serve as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands.

FIGURE 16.15 summarizes the functions of the main proteins that cooperate in DNA replication. FIGURE 16.16 is a visual summary of DNA replication.

Fig 16-16. A summary of DNA replication. The detailed diagram shows one replication fork, but as indicated in the overview diagram, replication usually occurs simultaneously at two forks, one at either end of a replication bubble. Notice in the overview diagram that a leading strand is initiated by an RNA primer (magenta), as is each Okazaki fragment in a lagging strand. Viewing each daughter strand in its entirety, you can see that half of it is made continuously as a leading strand, while the other half (on the other side of the origin) is synthesized in fragments as a lagging strand.

The DNA Replication Machine as a Stationary Complex

It is traditional--and convenient--to represent DNA polymerase molecules as locomotives moving along a DNA "railroad track," but such a model is inaccurate in two important ways. First, the various proteins that participate in DNA replication actually form a single large complex, a DNA replication "machine." Second, this machine is probably stationary during the replication process. In eukaryotic cells, the multiple copies of the machine, perhaps grouped into "factories," may anchor to the nuclear matrix, a framework of fibers extending through the interior of the nucleus. Recent studies support a model in which DNA polymerase molecules "reel in" the parental DNA and "extrude" newly made daughter DNA molecules.





 Enzymes proofread DNA during its replication and repair damage in existing DNA

We cannot attribute the accuracy of DNA replication solely to the specificity of base pairing. Although errors in the completed DNA molecule amount to only one in a billion nucleotides, initial pairing errors between incoming nucleotides and those in the template strand are 100,000 times more common--an error rate of one in 10,000 base pairs. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase itself proofreads each nucleotide against its template as soon as it is added to the growing strand. Upon finding an incorrectly paired nucleotide, the polymerase removes the nucleotide and then resumes synthesis. (This action resembles correcting a word-processing error by using the "delete" key and then entering the correction.)

Mismatched nucleotides sometimes evade proofreading by DNA polymerase or arise after DNA synthesis is completed--by damage to a nucleotide base, for instance. In mismatch repair, cells use special enzymes to fix incorrectly paired nucleotides. Researchers spotlighted the importance of such proteins when they found that a hereditary defect in one of them is associated with a form of colon cancer. Apparently, this defect allows cancer-causing errors to accumulate in the DNA.

Maintenance of the genetic information encoded in DNA requires frequent repair of various kinds of damage to existing DNA. DNA molecules are constantly subjected to potentially harmful chemical and physical agents. Reactive chemicals (in the environment and occurring naturally in cells), radioactive emissions, X-rays, and ultraviolet light can change nucleotides in ways that can affect encoded genetic information, usually adversely. In addition, DNA bases often undergo spontaneous chemical changes under normal cellular conditions. Fortunately, changes in DNA are usually corrected before they become self-perpetuating mutations. Each cell continuously monitors and repairs its genetic material. Because repair of damaged DNA is so important to the survival of an organism, it is no surprise that many different DNA repair enzymes have evolved. Almost 100 are known in E. coli, and 130 have been identified so far in humans.

Most mechanisms for repairing DNA damage take advantage of the base-paired structure of DNA. Usually, a segment of the strand containing the damage is cut out (excised) by a DNA-cutting enzyme--a nuclease--and the resulting gap is filled in with nucleotides properly paired with the nucleotides in the undamaged strand. The enzymes involved in filling the gap are a DNA polymerase and ligase. DNA repair of this type is called nucleotide excision repair (FIGURE 16.17).

Fig 16-17. Nucleotide excision repair of DNA damage. A team of enzymes detects and repairs damaged DNA. This figure shows DNA containing a thymine dimer, a type of damage often caused by ultra-violet radiation. Repair enzymes can excise the damaged region from the DNA and replace it with a normal DNA segment.

One function of the DNA repair enzymes in our skin cells is to repair genetic damage caused by the ultraviolet rays of sunlight. One type of damage, the type shown in FIGURE 16.17, is the covalent linking of thymine bases that are adjacent on a DNA strand. Such thymine dimers cause the DNA to buckle and interfere with DNA replication. The importance of repairing this kind of damage is underscored by the disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, which in most cases is caused by an inherited defect in a nucleotide excision repair enzyme. Individuals with this disorder are hypersensitive to sunlight; mutations in their skin cells caused by ultraviolet light are left uncorrected and cause skin cancer.





 The ends of DNA molecules are replicated by a special mechanism

Most DNA repair processes involve DNA polymerases, but these enzymes are helpless to fix a "defect" that results from their own limitations. For linear DNA, such as the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes, the fact that a DNA polymerase can only add nu cleotides to the 3&#39; end of a preexisting polynucleotide leads to a potential problem. The usual replication machinery provides no way to complete the 5&#39; ends of daughter DNA strands; as a result, repeated rounds of replication produce shorter and shorter DNA molecules (FIGURE 16.18, p. 300). If a cell divided enough times, essential genes would be deleted. Clearly, if this trend continued over generations, we would not be here today!



Click image to enlarge



Fig 16-18. The end-replication problem. When a linear DNA molecule replicates, a gap is left at the 5&#39; end of each new strand (light blue) because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to a 3&#39; end. As a result, with each round of replication, the DNA molecules get slightly shorter. For simplicity we show only one end of a linear DNA molecule.

Prokaryotes avoid this problem by having circular DNA molecules (which have no ends), but what about eukaryotes? Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA molecules have special nucleotide sequences called telomeres at their ends (FIGURE 16.19). Telomeres do not contain genes; instead, the DNA consists of multiple repetitions of one short nucleotide sequence. The repeated unit in human telomeres, which is typical, is the six-nucleotide sequence TTAGGG. The number of repetitions in a telomere varies between about 100 and 1,000. Telomeric DNA protects the organism's genes from being eroded through successive rounds of DNA replication. In addition, telomeric DNA and special proteins associated with it somehow prevent the ends from activating the cell's systems for monitoring DNA damage. (The end of a DNA molecule that is "seen" as a double-strand break may otherwise trigger signal-transduction pathways leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death.)

Fig 16-19. Telomeres and telomerase. Eukaryotes deal with the end-replication issue by having expendable, noncoding sequences called telomeres at the ends of their DNA and the enzyme telomerase in some of their cells.

In the long term, over the course of generations, eukaryotic organisms need a way of restoring their shortened telomeres. This is provided by telomerase, a special enzyme that catalyzes the lengthening of telomeres. But how does telomerase synthesize DNA where the DNA template has been lost? Telomerase is unusual in having a short molecule of RNA along with its protein. The RNA contains a nucleotide sequence that serves as the template for new telomere segments at the 3&#39; end of the telo-mere. FIGURE 16.19 shows how telomerase and DNA polymerase work together to lengthen telomeres.

Telomerase is not present in most cells of multicellular organisms like ourselves, and the DNA of dividing somatic cells does tend to be shorter in older individuals and in cultured cells that have divided many times. Thus, it is possible that telomeres are a limiting factor in the life span of certain tissues and even the organism as a whole. In any case, telomerase is present in germ-line cells, those that give rise to gametes. The enzyme produces long telomeres in these cells and hence in the newborn.

Intriguingly, researchers have also found telomerase in somatic cells that are cancerous. Cells from large tumors often have unusually short telomeres, as one would expect for cells that have undergone many cell divisions. Progressive shortening would presumably lead eventually to self-destruction of the cancer unless telomerase became available to stabilize telomere length. This is exactly what seems to happen in cancer cells and also in immortal strains of cultured cells (see Chapter 12). If telomerase is indeed an important factor in many cancers, it may provide a useful target for both cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.

DNA replication provides the copies of genes that parents pass to offspring via gametes. However, it is not enough that genes be copied and transmitted; they must also be expressed. How do genes manifest themselves in phenotypic characters such as eye color? In the next chapter, we will examine the molecular basis of gene expression--how the cell translates genetic information encoded in DNA.

   What is a gene? revisiting the question

The information content of DNA, the genetic material, is in the form of specific sequences of nucleotides along the DNA strands. But how is this information related to an organism's inherited traits? Put another way, what does a gene actually say? And how is its message translated by cells into a specific trait, such as brown hair or type A blood?

Consider, once again, Mendel's peas. One of the characters Mendel studied was stem length (seeTABLE 14.1). Variation in a single gene accounts for the difference between the tall and dwarf varieties of pea plants. Mendel did not know the physiological basis of this phenotypic difference, but plant scientists have since worked out the explanation: Dwarf peas lack growth hormones called gibberellins, which stimulate the normal elongation of stems. A dwarf plant treated with gibberellins grows to normal height. Why do dwarf peas fail to make their own gibberellins? They are missing a key protein, an enzyme required for gibberellin synthesis. This example illustrates the main point of this chapter: The DNA inherited by an organism leads to specific traits by dictating the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are the links between genotype and phenotype. This chapter explores the flow of information from genes to proteins.

Researchers are now working out the structures and processes of protein synthesis in amazing detail. See, for example, the computer graphic on this page, which shows a ribosome at the molecular level. The exploded view at the right also shows three transfer RNA molecules, in red, orange, and yellow. As you will learn in this chapter, these molecules cooperate with the ribosome in polypeptide synthesis. But before going into the details of how genes direct protein synthesis, let's step back and examine how the fundamental relationship between genes and proteins was discovered.

 The study of metabolic defects provided evidence that genes specify proteins

In 1909, British physician Archibald Garrod was the first to suggest that genes dictate phenotypes through enzymes that catalyze specific chemical reactions in the cell. Garrod postulated that the symptoms of an inherited disease reflect a person's inability to make a particular enzyme. He referred to such diseases as "inborn errors of metabolism." Garrod gave as one example the hereditary condition called alkaptonuria, in which the urine is black because it contains the chemical alkapton, which darkens upon exposure to air. Garrod reasoned that normal individuals have an enzyme that breaks down alkapton, whereas alkaptonuric individuals have inherited an inability to make the enzyme that metabolizes alkapton.

How Genes Control Metabolism: One Gene-One Enzyme

Garrod's idea was ahead of its time, but research conducted several decades later supported his hypothesis that a gene dictates the production of a specific enzyme. Biochemists accumulated much evidence that cells synthesize and degrade most organic molecules via metabolic pathways, in which each chemical reaction in a sequence is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Such metabolic pathways lead, for instance, to the synthesis of the pigments that give fruit flies (Drosophila) their eye color (see FIGURE 15.2). In the 1930s, George Beadle and Boris Ephrussi speculated that each of the various mutations affecting eye color in Drosophila blocks pigment synthesis at a specific step by preventing production of the enzyme that catalyzes that step. However, neither the chemical reactions nor the enzymes that catalyze them were known at the time.

A breakthrough in demonstrating the relationship between genes and enzymes came a few years later, when Beadle and Edward Tatum began working with a bread mold, Neurospora crassa. They treated Neurospora with X-rays and then looked among the survivors for mutants that differed from the wild-type mold in their nutritional needs. Wild-type Neurospora has modest food requirements. It can survive in the laboratory on agar (a moist support medium) mixed only with inorganic salts, glucose, and the vitamin biotin. From this minimal medium, the mold uses its metabolic pathways to produce all the other molecules it needs. Beadle and Tatum identified mutants that could not survive on minimal medium, apparently because they were unable to synthesize certain essential molecules from the minimal ingredients. However, most such nutritional mutants can survive on a complete growth medium, minimal medium supplemented with all 20 amino acids and a few other nutrients.

To characterize the metabolic defect in each nutritional mutant, Beadle and Tatum took samples from the mutant growing on complete medium and distributed them to a number of different vials. Each vial contained minimal medium plus a single additional nutrient. The particular supplement that allowed growth indicated the metabolic defect. For example, if the only supplemented vial that supported growth of the mutant was the one fortified with the amino acid arginine, the researchers could conclude that the mutant was defective in the biochemical pathway that wild-type cells use to synthesize arginine.

Beadle and Tatum went on to pin down each mutant's defect more specifically. Their work with arginine-requiring mutants was especially instructive. Using genetic crosses, they determined that their mutants fell into three classes, each mutated in a different gene. The researchers then showed that they could distinguish among the classes of mutants nutritionally by additional tests of their growth requirements (FIGURE 17.1). In the synthetic pathway leading to arginine, they suspected, a precursor nutrient is converted to ornithine, which is converted to citrulline, which is converted to arginine. When they tested their arginine mutants for growth on ornithine and citrulline, they found that one class could grow on either compound (or arginine), the second class only on citrulline (or arginine), and the third on neither--it absolutely required arginine. The three classes of mutants, the researchers reasoned, must be blocked at different steps in the pathway that synthesizes arginine, with each mutant class lacking the enzyme that catalyzes the blocked step.

Fig 17-1. Beadle and Tatum's evidence for the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis. In this experiment, the researchers studied three classes of mutants of the mold Neurospora crassa, all defective in synthesizing the amino acid arginine. The wild-type strain requires only a minimal nutritional medium for growth; it makes arginine by using a multistep pathway in which ornithine and citrulline are intermediates. The different types of mutants had different growth requirements. Beadle and Tatum concluded that each gene mutated must normally dictate the production of one enzyme: the one gene--one enzyme hypothesis.

Because each mutant was defective in a single gene, Beadle and Tatum's results provided strong support for the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, as they dubbed it, which states that the function of a gene is to dictate the production of a specific enzyme. The researchers also showed how a combination of genetics and biochemistry could be used to work out the steps in a metabolic pathway. Further support for the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis came with biochemical experiments that identified the specific enzymes lacking in the mutants.

One Gene-One Polypeptide

As researchers learned more about proteins, they made minor revisions in the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis. Not all proteins are enzymes. Keratin, the structural protein of animal hair, and the hormone insulin are two examples of nonenzyme proteins. Because proteins that are not enzymes are nevertheless gene products, molecular biologists began to think in terms of one gene-one protein. However, many proteins are constructed from two or more different polypeptide chains, and each polypeptide is specified by its own gene. For example, hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein of vertebrate red blood cells, is built from two kinds of polypeptides, and thus two genes code for this protein (see FIGURE 5.23b). We can therefore restate Beadle and Tatum's idea as the one gene-one polypeptide hypothesis. Note, however, that it is common to refer to proteins, rather than polypeptides, as the gene products, a practice you will encounter in this book.





 Transcription and translation are the two main processes linking gene to protein: an overview

Genes provide the instructions for making specific proteins. But a gene does not build a protein directly. The bridge between DNA and protein synthesis is RNA. You learned in Chapter 5 that RNA is chemically similar to DNA, except that it contains ribose instead of deoxyribose as its sugar and has the nitrogenous base uracil rather than thymine (see FIGURE 5.29). Thus, each nucleotide along a DNA strand has deoxyribose as its sugar and A, G, C, or T as its base; each nucleotide along an RNA strand has ribose as its sugar and A, G, C, or U as its base. An RNA molecule almost always consists of a single strand.

It is customary to describe the flow of information from gene to protein in linguistic terms because both nucleic acids and proteins are polymers with specific sequences of monomers that convey information, much as specific sequences of letters communicate information in a language like English. In DNA or RNA, the monomers are the four types of nucleotides, which differ in their nitrogenous bases. Genes are typically hundreds or thousands of nucleotides long, each gene having a specific sequence of bases. Each polypeptide of a protein also has monomers arranged in a particular linear order (the protein's primary structure), but its monomers are the 20 amino acids. Thus, nucleic acids and proteins contain information written in two different chemical languages. To get from DNA, written in one language, to protein, written in the other, requires two major stages, transcription and translation.

Transcription is the synthesis of RNA under the direction of DNA. Both nucleic acids use the same language, and the information is simply transcribed, or copied, from one molecule to the other. Just as a DNA strand provides a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand during DNA replication, it provides a template for assembling a sequence of RNA nucleotides. The resulting RNA molecule is a faithful transcript of the gene's protein-building instructions. This type of RNA molecule is called messenger RNA (mRNA), because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein-synthesizing machinery of the cell (FIGURE 17.2a). (Transcription is the general term for the synthesis of any kind of RNA on a DNA template. Later in this chapter, you will learn about other types of RNA produced by transcription.)

Fig 17-2. Overview: the roles of transcription and translation in the flow of genetic information. In a cell, inherited information flows from DNA to RNA to protein. The two main stages of information flow are transcription and translation. In transcription, a gene provides the instructions for synthesizing a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. In translation, the information encoded in mRNA determines the order of amino acids that are joined to form a specific polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes. A miniature version of part b (or sometimes part a) accompanies several figures later in the Chapter as an orientation diagram to help you see where a particular figure fits into the overall scheme.

Translation is the actual synthesis of a polypeptide, which occurs under the direction of mRNA. During this stage, there is a change in language: The cell must translate the base sequence of an mRNA molecule into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes, complex particles that facilitate the orderly linking of amino acids into polypeptide chains.

Although the basic mechanics of transcription and translation are similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there is an important difference in the flow of genetic information within the cells. Because bacteria lack nuclei, their DNA is not segregated from ribosomes and the other protein-synthesizing equipment. Transcription and translation are coupled, with ribosomes attaching to the leading end of an mRNA molecule while transcription is still in progress (see FIGURE 17.22). In a eukaryotic cell, by contrast, the nuclear envelope separates transcription from translation in space and time (FIGURE 17.2b). Transcription occurs in the nucleus, and mRNA is dispatched to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. But before they can leave the nucleus, eukaryotic RNA transcripts are modified in various ways to produce the final, functional mRNA. Thus, in a two-step process, the transcription of a eukaryotic gene results in pre-mRNA, and RNA processing yields the finished mRNA. A more general term for an initial RNA transcript is primary transcript.

Let's summarize the main point of our overview of protein synthesis: Genes program protein synthesis via genetic messages in the form of messenger RNA. Put another way, cells are governed by a molecular chain of command: DNA  RNA  protein. The next section discusses how the instructions for assembling amino acids into a specific order are encoded in nucleic acids.





 In the genetic code, nucleotide triplets specify amino acids

When biologists began to suspect that the instructions for protein synthesis were encoded in DNA, they recognized a problem: There are only four nucleotides to specify 20 amino acids. Thus, the genetic code cannot be a language like Chinese, where each written symbol corresponds to a single word. If each nucleotide base were translated into an amino acid, only 4 of the 20 amino acids could be specified. Would a language of two-letter code words suffice? The base sequence AG, for example, could specify one amino acid, and GT could specify another. Since there are four bases, this would give us 16 (that is, 42) possible arrangements--still not enough to code for all 20 amino acids.

Triplets of nucleotide bases are the smallest units of uniform length that can code for all the amino acids. If each arrangement of three consecutive bases specifies an amino acid, there can be 64 (that is, 43) possible code words--more than enough to specify all the amino acids. Experiments have verified that the flow of information from gene to protein is based on a triplet code: The genetic instructions for a polypeptide chain are written in the DNA as a series of three-nucleotide words. For example, the base triplet AGT at a particular position along a DNA strand results in the placement of the amino acid serine at the corresponding position of the polypeptide to be produced.

As you know, a cell does not directly translate a gene into amino acids. The intermediate step is transcription, during which the gene determines the sequence of base triplets along the length of an mRNA molecule. For each gene, only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed (FIGURE 17.3). This strand is called the template strand, because it provides the template for ordering the sequence of nucleotides in an RNA transcript. A given DNA strand can be the template strand in some regions of a DNA molecule, while in other regions along the double helix it is the complementary strand that functions as the template for RNA synthesis.

Fig 17-3. The triplet code. For each gene, one DNA strand functions as a template for transcription--the synthesis of a complementary mRNA molecule. The base-pairing rules for DNA synthesis also guide transcription, but uracil (U) takes the place of thymine (T) in RNA. During translation, the mRNA is read as a sequence of base triplets, called codons. Each codon specifies an amino acid to be added to the growing polypeptide chain. The mRNA is read in the 5&#39; 3&#39; direction.

An mRNA molecule is complementary rather than identical to its DNA template because RNA bases are assembled on the template according to base-pairing rules. The pairs are similar to those that form during DNA replication, except that U, the RNA substitute for T, pairs with A. Thus, when a DNA strand is transcribed, the base triplet ACC in DNA provides a template for UGG in the mRNA molecule. The mRNA base triplets are called codons. For example, UGG is the codon for the amino acid tryptophan (abbreviated Trp). (The term codon is also sometimes used for the complementary DNA base triplet. For example, the DNA codon corresponding to the RNA codon UGG is ACC.)

During translation, the sequence of codons along an mRNA molecule is decoded, or translated, into a sequence of amino acids making up a polypeptide chain. The codons are read in the 5&#39; 3&#39; direction along the mRNA. (To review what is meant by the 5&#39; and 3&#39; ends of a nucleic acid chain, see FIGURE 16.12.) Each codon specifies which one of the 20 amino acids will be incorporated at the corresponding position along a polypeptide. Because codons are base triplets, the number of nucleotides making up a genetic message must be three times the number of amino acids making up the protein product. For example, it takes 300 nucleotides along an RNA strand to code for a polypeptide that is 100 amino acids long.

Cracking the Genetic Code

Molecular biologists cracked the code of life in the early 1960s, when a series of elegant experiments disclosed the amino acid translations of each of the RNA codons. The first codon was deciphered in 1961 by Marshall Nirenberg, of the National Institutes of Health, and his colleagues. Nirenberg synthesized an artificial mRNA by linking identical RNA nucleotides containing uracil as their base. No matter where this message started or stopped, it could contain only one codon in repetition: UUU. Nirenberg added this "poly(U)" to a test-tube mixture containing amino acids, ribosomes, and the other components required for protein synthesis. His artificial system translated the poly(U) into a polypeptide containing a single amino acid, phenylalanine (Phe), strung together as a long polyphenylalanine chain. Thus, Nirenberg determined that the mRNA codon UUU specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. Soon, the amino acids specified by the codons AAA, GGG, and CCC were also determined.

Although more elaborate techniques were required to decode mixed triplets such as AUA and CGA, all 64 codons were deciphered by the mid-1960s. As FIGURE 17.4 shows, 61 of the 64 triplets code for amino acids. Notice that the codon AUG has a dual function: It not only codes for the amino acid methionine (Met), but also functions as a "start" signal, or initiation codon. Genetic messages begin with the mRNA codon AUG, which signals the protein-synthesizing machinery to begin translating the mRNA at that location. (Because AUG also stands for methionine, polypeptide chains begin with methionine when they are synthesized. However, an enzyme may subsequently remove this starter amino acid from a chain.) The remaining three codons do not designate amino acids. Instead, they are "stop" signals, or termination codons, marking the end of translation.

Fig 17-4. The dictionary of the genetic code. The three bases of an mRNA codon are designated here as the first, second, and third bases, reading in the 5&#39; 3&#39; direction along the mRNA. (Practice using this dictionary by finding the codons in FIGURE 17.3.) The codon AUG not only stands for the amino acid methionine (Met) but also functions as a "start" signal for ribosomes to begin translating the mRNA at that point. Three of the 64 codons function as "stop" signals. Any one of these termination codons marks the end of a genetic message.

Notice in FIGURE 17.4 that there is redundancy in the genetic code, but no ambiguity. For example, although codons GAA and GAG both specify glutamic acid (redundancy), neither of them ever specifies any other amino acid (no ambiguity). The redundancy in the code is not altogether random. In many cases, codons that are synonyms for a particular amino acid differ only in the third base of the triplet. We will consider a possible benefit for this redundancy later in the chapter.

Our ability to extract the intended message from a written language depends on reading the symbols in the correct groupings--that is, in the correct reading frame. Consider this statement: "The red dog ate the cat." Group the letters incorrectly by starting at the wrong point, and the result will probably be gibberish: for example, "her edd oga tet hec at." The reading frame is also important in the molecular language of cells. The short stretch of polypeptide shown in FIGURE 17.3, for instance, will only be made correctly if the mRNA nucleotides are read from left to right (5&#39; 3&#39;) in the groups of three shown in the figure: UGG UUU GGC UCA. Although a genetic message is written with no spaces between the codons, the cell's protein-synthesizing machinery reads the message as a series of nonoverlapping three-letter words. The message is not read as a series of overlapping words--UGG UUU, and so on--which would convey a very different message.

Let's summarize what we have just covered. Genetic information is encoded as a sequence of nonoverlapping base triplets, or codons, each of which is translated into a specific amino acid during protein synthesis.





 The genetic code must have evolved very early in the history of life

The genetic code is nearly universal, shared by organisms from the simplest bacteria to the most complex plants and animals. The RNA codon CCG, for instance, is translated as the amino acid proline in all organisms whose genetic code has been examined. In laboratory experiments, genes can be transcribed and translated after they are transplanted from one species to another (FIGURE 17.5). One important application is that bacteria can be programmed by the insertion of human genes to synthesize certain human proteins that have important medical uses. Such applications have produced many exciting developments in biotechnology, which you will learn about in Chapter 20.

Fig 17-5. A tobacco plant expressing a firefly gene. Because diverse forms of life share a common genetic code, it is possible to program one species to produce proteins characteristic of another species by transplanting DNA. In this experiment, researchers were able to incorporate a gene from a firefly into the DNA of a tobacco plant. The gene codes for the firefly enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of light.

Exceptions to the universality of the genetic code are translation systems where a few codons differ from the standard ones. The main examples are found in certain single-celled eukaryotes, such as Paramecium, an organism you may know from the lab. Other examples are found in certain mitochondria and chloroplasts, which transcribe and translate the genes carried by their small amount of DNA. However, the evolutionary significance of the code's near universality is clear. A language shared by all living things must have been operating very early in the history of life--early enough to be present in the common ancestors of all modern organisms. A shared genetic vocabulary is a reminder of the kinship that bonds all life on Earth.

Now that we have considered the linguistic logic and evolutionary significance of the genetic code, we are ready to reexamine transcription, translation, and related topics in more detail.





 Transcription is the DNA-directed synthesis of RNA: a closer look

Messenger RNA, the carrier of information from DNA to the cell's protein-synthesizing machinery, is transcribed from the template strand of a gene. An enzyme called an RNA polymerase pries the two strands of DNA apart and hooks together the RNA nucleotides as they base-pair along the DNA template (FIGURE 17.6). Like the DNA polymerases that function in DNA replication, RNA polymerases can add nucleotides only to the 3&#39; end of the growing polymer. Thus, an RNA molecule elongates in its 5&#39; 3&#39; direction.

Fig 17-6. The stages of transcription: initiation, elongation, and termination. RNA polymerase moves along a gene from the promoter (green) to just beyond the terminator (red), assembling an RNA molecule (transcript) complementary to the gene's template strand. In a prokaryote, the RNA transcript of a protein-coding gene is immediately usable as mRNA; in a eukaryote, it must first undergo processing, as described on pp. 311-312.

Specific sequences of nucleotides along the DNA mark where transcription of a gene begins and ends. The DNA sequence where RNA polymerase attaches and initiates transcription is known as the promoter; the sequence that signals the end of transcription is called the terminator. Molecular biologists refer to the direction of transcription as "downstream" and the other direction as "upstream." These terms are also used to describe the positions of nucleotide sequences within the DNA or RNA. Thus, the promoter sequence in DNA is said to be upstream from the terminator. The stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit.

Bacteria have a single type of RNA polymerase that synthesizes not only mRNA but also other types of RNA that function in protein synthesis. In contrast, eukaryotes have three types of RNA polymerase in their nuclei, numbered I, II, and III. The one used for mRNA synthesis is RNA polymerase II. In the discussion of transcription that follows, we start with the features of mRNA synthesis common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and then describe some key differences.

The three stages of transcription, as shown in FIGURE 17.6 and described next, are initiation, elongation, and termination of the RNA chain. Study FIGURE 17.6 to familiarize yourself with the stages of transcription and the terms used to describe them.

RNA Polymerase Binding and Initiation of Transcription

The promoter of a gene includes within it the transcription start point (the nucleotide where RNA synthesis actually begins) and typically extends several dozen nucleotide pairs "upstream" from the start point. In addition to serving as a binding site for RNA polymerase and determining where transcription starts, the promoter determines which of the two strands of the DNA helix is used as the template.

Certain sections of a promoter are especially important for binding RNA polymerase. In prokaryotes, the RNA polymerase itself specifically recognizes and binds to the promoter. In eukaryotes, a collection of proteins called transcription factors mediate the binding of RNA polymerase and the initiation of transcription. Only after certain transcription factors are attached to the promoter does the RNA polymerase bind to it. The completed assembly of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bound to the promoter is called a transcription initiation complex. FIGURE 17.7 shows the role of transcription factors and a crucial promoter DNA sequence called a TATA box in forming the initiation complex.

Fig 17-7. The initiation of transcription at a eukaryotic promoter. In eukaryotic cells, proteins called transcription factors mediate the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase. The enzyme that transcribes protein-coding genes in eukaryotic cells is called RNA polymerase II.

The interaction between eukaryotic RNA polymerase and transcription factors is an example of the special importance of protein-protein interactions in controlling eukaryotic transcription (as we will discuss further in Chapter 19). Once the polymerase is firmly attached to the promoter DNA, the two DNA strands unwind there, and the enzyme starts transcribing the template strand.

Elongation of the RNA Strand

As RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, it continues to untwist the double helix, exposing about 10 to 20 DNA bases at a time for pairing with RNA nucleotides (see FIGURE 17.6). The enzyme adds nucleotides to the 3&#39; end of the growing RNA molecule as it continues along the double helix. In the wake of this advancing wave of RNA synthesis, the DNA double helix re-forms and the new RNA molecule peels away from its DNA template. Transcription progresses at a rate of about 60 nucleotides per second in eukaryotes.

A single gene can be transcribed simultaneously by several molecules of RNA polymerase following each other like trucks in a convoy. A growing strand of RNA trails off from each polymerase, with the length of each new strand reflecting how far along the template the enzyme has traveled from the start point (see FIGURE 17.22). The congregation of many polymerase molecules simultaneously transcribing a single gene increases the amount of mRNA transcribed from it, which helps the cell make the encoded protein in large amounts.

Termination of Transcription

Transcription proceeds until after the RNA polymerase transcribes a terminator sequence in the DNA. The transcribed terminator--an RNA sequence--functions as the actual termination signal. There are several different mechanisms of transcription termination, the details of which are still somewhat murky. In the prokaryotic cell, transcription usually stops right at the end of the termination signal; when the polymerase reaches that point, it releases both the RNA and the DNA. By contrast, in the eukaryotic cell, the polymerase continues for hundreds of nucleotides past the termination signal, which is an AAUAAA sequence in the pre-mRNA (see FIGURE 17.8). But then, at a point about 10 to 35 nucleotides past the AAUAAA, the pre-mRNA is cut free from the enzyme. The cleavage site on the RNA is also the site for the addition of a poly(A) tail--one step of RNA processing, our next topic.

Fig 17-8. RNA processing: addition of the 5&#39; cap and poly(A) tail. Enzymes modify the two ends of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecule. The modified ends help protect the RNA from degradation, and the poly(A) tail may promote the export of mRNA from the nucleus. When the mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, the modified ends, in conjunction with certain cytoplasmic proteins, facilitate ribosome attachment. The leader and trailer are not translated, nor is the poly(A) tail.





 Eukaryotic cells modify RNA after transcription

Enzymes in the eukaryotic nucleus modify pre-mRNA in various ways before the genetic messages are dispatched to the cytoplasm. During this RNA processing, both ends of the primary transcript are usually altered. In most cases, certain interior sections of the molecule are then cut out and the remaining parts spliced together.

Alteration of mRNA Ends

Each end of a pre-mRNA molecule is modified in a particular way. The 5&#39; end, the end made first during transcription, is im mediately capped off with a modified form of a guanine (G) nucleotide. This 5&#39; cap has at least two important functions. First, it helps protect the mRNA from degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. Second, after the mRNA reaches the cytoplasm, the 5&#39; cap functions as part of an "attach here" sign for ribosomes. The other end of an mRNA molecule, the 3&#39; end, is also modified before the message exits the nucleus. At the 3&#39; end, an enzyme makes a poly(A) tail consisting of some 50 to 250 adenine nu cleotides. Like the 5&#39; cap, the poly(A) tail inhibits degradation of the RNA and probably helps ribosomes attach to it. The poly(A) tail also seems to facilitate the export of mRNA from the nucleus. FIGURE 17.8 shows a eukaryotic mRNA molecule with cap and tail; it also shows the nontranslated leader and trailer segments of RNA to which they are attached.

Split Genes and RNA Splicing

The most remarkable stage of RNA processing in the eukaryotic nucleus is the removal of a large portion of the RNA molecule that is initially synthesized--a cut-and-paste job called RNA splicing (FIGURE 17.9, p. 312). The average length of a transcription unit along a eukaryotic DNA molecule is about 8,000 nucleotides, so the primary RNA transcript is also that long. But it takes only about 1,200 nucleotides to code for an average-sized protein of 400 amino acids. (Remember, each amino acid is encoded by a triplet of nucleotides.) This means that most eukaryotic genes and their RNA transcripts have long noncoding stretches of nucleotides, regions that are not translated. Even more surprising is that most of these noncoding sequences are interspersed between coding segments of the gene and thus between coding segments of the pre-mRNA. In other words, the sequence of DNA nucleotides that codes for a eukaryotic polypeptide is not continuous. The noncoding segments of nucleic acid that lie between coding regions are called intervening sequences, or introns for short. The other regions are called exons, because they are eventually expressed, usually by being translated into amino acid sequences. (Exceptions include the leader and trailer portions of the exons at the ends of the RNA. Because of these exceptions, you may find it helpful to think of exons as DNA that exits the nucleus.) The terms intron and exon are used for both DNA and RNA. Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp, who independently found evidence of "split genes" in 1977, shared a Nobel Prize in 1993 for this discovery.

Fig 17-9. RNA processing: RNA splicing. The RNA molecule shown here codes for b globin, one of the polypeptides of hemoglobin. The numbers under the RNA refer to codons; b globin is 146 amino acids long. The b globin gene and its pre-mRNA transcript have three regions, called exons, that consist mostly of coding sequences; exons are separated by noncoding regions, called introns. During RNA processing, the introns are excised and the exons are spliced together.

In making a primary transcript from a gene, RNA polymerase transcribes both introns and exons from the DNA, but the mRNA molecule that enters the cytoplasm is an abridged version. The introns are cut out from the molecule and the exons joined together to form an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This is the process of RNA splicing.

How is pre-mRNA splicing carried out? Researchers have learned that the signals for RNA splicing are short nucleotide sequences at the ends of introns. Particles called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, or snRNPs (pronounced "snurps"), recognize these splice sites. As the name implies, snRNPs are located in the cell nucleus and are composed of RNA and protein molecules. The RNA in a snRNP particle is called a small nuclear RNA (snRNA); each molecule is about 150 nucleotides long. Several different snRNPs join with additional proteins to form an even larger assembly called a spliceosome, which is almost as big as a ribosome. The spliceosome interacts with the splice sites at the ends of an intron. It cuts at specific points to release the intron, then immediately joins together the two exons that flanked the intron (FIGURE 17.10). There is strong evidence that snRNA plays a role in the catalytic process as well as in spliceosome assembly and splice site recognition. The idea of a catalytic role for snRNA arose from the discovery of ribozymes, RNA molecules that function as enzymes.

		 Pre-mRNA containing exons and introns combines with small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins to form a molecular complex called a spliceosome. 
			  
		 Within the spliceosome, snRNA base-pairs with nucleotides at the ends of the intron. 
			  
		 The RNA transcript is cut to release the intron, and the exons are spliced together. The spliceosome then comes apart, releasing mRNA, which now contains only exons.

Ribozymes

Like pre-mRNA, other kinds of primary transcripts may also be spliced, but by diverse mechanisms that do not involve spliceosomes. However, as in the mRNA case, RNA is often involved in catalyzing the reactions. In a few cases, the splicing occurs completely without proteins or even extra RNA molecules: The intron RNA catalyzes its own excision! For example, in the protozoan Tetrahymena, self-splicing occurs in the production of an RNA component of the organism's ribosomes (ribosomal RNA). Like enzymes, ribozymes function as catalysts. The discovery of ribozymes rendered obsolete the statement "All biological catalysts are proteins."

The Functional and Evolutionary Importance of Introns

What are the biological functions of introns and RNA splicing? One idea is that introns play regulatory roles in the cell. At least some introns contain sequences that control gene activity in some way, and the splicing process itself may help regulate the passage of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm.

One established benefit of split genes is to enable a single gene to encode more than one kind of polypeptide. A number of genes are known to give rise to two or more different polypeptides, depending on which segments are treated as exons during RNA processing; this is called alternative RNA splicing (see FIGURE 19.11). The fruit fly provides an interesting example: Sex differences in this animal are largely due to differences in how males and females splice the RNA transcribed from certain genes. Early results from the Human Genome Project (discussed in Chapter 20) suggest that alternative RNA splicing may be one reason humans can get along with a relatively small number of genes--only about twice as many as a fruit fly.

Split genes may also facilitate the evolution of new and potentially useful proteins. Proteins often have a modular architecture consisting of discrete structural and functional regions called domains. One domain of an enzymatic protein, for instance, might include the active site, while another might attach the protein to a cellular membrane. In many cases, different exons code for the different domains of a protein (FIGURE 17.11). Introns increase the probability of potentially beneficial crossing over between genes. Simply by providing more places where crossing over can occur (and without interfering with coding sequences), introns increase the opportunity for recombination between two alleles of a gene and raise the probability that a crossover will switch one version of an exon for another version found on the homologous chromosome. We can also imagine the occasional mixing and matching of exons between completely different (nonallelic) genes. Exon shuffling of either sort could lead to new proteins with novel combinations of functions.

Fig 17-11. Correspondence between exons and protein domains. In a number of genes, different exons encode separate domains of the protein product. Each domain, an independently folding part of the protein, performs a different function. Such correspondence between exons and domains suggests that new proteins can evolve by exon shuffling among genes.





 Translation is the RNA-directed synthesis of a polypeptide: a closer look

In the process of translation, a cell interprets a genetic message and builds a protein accordingly. The message is a series of codons along an mRNA molecule, and the interpreter is called transfer RNA (tRNA). The function of tRNA is to transfer amino acids from the cytoplasm's amino acid pool to a ribosome. A cell keeps its cytoplasm stocked with all 20 amino acids, either by synthesizing them from other compounds or by taking them up from the surrounding solution. The ribosome adds each amino acid brought to it by tRNA to the growing end of a polypeptide chain (FIGURE 17.12, p. 314).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 17-12. Translation: the basic concept. As a molecule of mRNA is moved through a ribosome, codons are translated into amino acids, one by one. The interpreters are tRNA molecules, each type with a specific anticodon at one end and a certain amino acid at the other end. A tRNA adds its amino acid cargo to a growing polypeptide chain when the anticodon bonds to a complementary codon on the mRNA. The figures that follow show some of the details of translation in the prokaryotic cell.

Molecules of tRNA are not all identical. The key to translating a genetic message into a specific amino acid sequence is that each type of tRNA molecule links a particular mRNA codon with a particular amino acid. As a tRNA molecule arrives at a ribosome, it bears a specific amino acid at one end. At the other end is a nucleotide triplet called an anticodon, which base-pairs with a complementary codon on mRNA. For example, consider the mRNA codon UUU, which is translated as the amino acid phenylalanine (see FIGURE 17.4). The tRNA that plugs into this codon by hydrogen bonding has AAA as its anticodon and carries phenylalanine at its other end. As an mRNA molecule is moved through a ribosome, phenylalanine will be added to the polypeptide chain whenever the codon UUU is presented for translation. Codon by codon, the genetic message is translated as tRNAs deposit amino acids in the order prescribed, and the ribosome joins the amino acids into a chain. The tRNA molecule is like a flash card with a nucleic acid word (anticodon) on one side and a protein word (amino acid) on the other.

Translation is simple in principle but complex in its biochemistry and mechanics, especially in the eukaryotic cell. In dissecting translation, we'll concentrate on the slightly less complicated version of the process that occurs in prokaryotes. Let's first look at some of the major players in this cellular drama, then see how they act together to make a polypeptide.

The Structure and Function of Transfer RNA

Like mRNA and other types of cellular RNA, transfer RNA molecules are transcribed from DNA templates. In a eukaryotic cell, tRNA, like mRNA, is made in the nucleus and must travel from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, each tRNA molecule is used repeatedly, picking up its designated amino acid in the cytosol, depositing this cargo at the ribosome, and then leaving the ribosome to pick up another load.

As illustrated in FIGURE 17.13, a tRNA molecule consists of a single RNA strand that is only about 80 nucleotides long (compared to hundreds of nucleotides for most mRNA molecules). This RNA strand folds back upon itself to form a molecule with a three-dimensional structure reinforced by interactions between different parts of the nucleotide chain. Nucleotide bases in certain regions of the tRNA strand form hydrogen bonds with complementary bases of other regions. Flattened into one plane to reveal this base pairing, a tRNA molecule looks like a cloverleaf. The tRNA actually twists and folds into a compact three-dimensional structure that is roughly L-shaped. The loop protruding from one end of the L includes the anticodon, the specialized base triplet that binds to a specific mRNA codon. From the other end of the L-shaped tRNA molecule protrudes its 3&#39; end, which is the attachment site for an amino acid. Thus, the structure of a tRNA molecule fits its function.

For base pairing, RNA strands must be antiparallel, like DNA (see FIGURE 16.12). For example, anticodon 3&#39;-AAG-5&#39; pairs with mRNA codon 5&#39;-UUC-3&#39;.

If one tRNA variety existed for each of the mRNA codons that specifies an amino acid, there would be 61 tRNAs (see FIGURE 17.4). The actual number is smaller: about 45. This number is sufficient because some tRNAs have anticodons that can recognize two or more different codons. Such versatility is possible because the rules for base pairing between the third base of a codon and the corresponding base of a tRNA anticodon are not as strict as those for DNA and mRNA codons. For example, the base U of a tRNA anticodon can pair with either A or G in the third position of an mRNA codon. This relaxation of the base-pairing rules is called wobble. The most versatile tRNAs are those with inosine (I), a modified base, in the wobble position of the anticodon. Inosine is formed by enzymatic alteration of adenine after tRNA is synthesized. When anticodons associate with codons, the base I can hydrogen-bond with any one of three bases: U, C, or A. Thus, the tRNA molecule that has CCI as its anticodon can bind to the codons GGU, GGC, and GGA, all of which code for the amino acid glycine. Wobble explains why the synonymous codons for a given amino acid can differ in their third base, but usually not in their other bases.

Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases

Codon-anticodon bonding is actually the second of two recognition steps required for the accurate translation of a genetic message. It must be preceded by a correct match between tRNA and an amino acid. A tRNA that binds to an mRNA codon specifying a particular amino acid must carry only that amino acid to the ribosome. Each amino acid is joined to the correct tRNA by a specific enzyme called an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. There are 20 of these enzymes in the cell, one enzyme for each amino acid. The active site of each type of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase fits only a specific combination of amino acid and tRNA. The synthetase catalyzes the covalent attachment of the amino acid to its tRNA in a process driven by the hydrolysis of ATP (FIGURE 17.14). The resulting aminoacyl tRNA, also called an activated amino acid, is released from the enzyme and delivers its amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain on a ribosome.

Fig 17-14. An aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase joins a specific amino acid to a tRNA. Linkage of the tRNA and amino acid is an endergonic process that occurs at the expense of ATP. The ATP loses two phosphate groups, becoming AMP (adenosine monophosphate).

Ribosomes

Ribosomes facilitate the specific coupling of tRNA anticodons with mRNA codons during protein synthesis. A ribosome, which is large enough to be seen with an electron microscope, is made up of two subunits, called the large and small subunits (FIGURE 17.15). The ribosomal subunits are constructed of proteins and RNA molecules named ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In eukaryotes, the subunits are made in the nucleolus. Ribosomal RNA genes on the chromosomal DNA are transcribed, and the RNA is processed and assembled with proteins imported from the cytoplasm. The resulting ribosomal subunits are then exported via nuclear pores to the cytoplasm. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, large and small subunits join to form a functional ribosome only when they attach to an mRNA molecule. About two-thirds of the mass of a ribosome is rRNA. Because most cells contain thousands of ribosomes, rRNA is the most abundant type of RNA.

Fig 17-15. The anatomy of a functioning ribosome.

Although the ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are very similar in structure and function, those of eukaryotes are slightly larger and differ somewhat from prokaryotic ribosomes in their molecular composition. The differences are medically significant. Certain antibiotic drugs can paralyze prokaryotic ribosomes without inhibiting the ability of eukaryotic ribosomes to make proteins. These drugs, including tetracycline and streptomycin, are used to combat bacterial infections.

The structure of a ribosome reflects its function of bringing mRNA together with amino acid-bearing tRNAs. In addition to a binding site for mRNA, each ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA (see FIGURE 17.15). The P site (peptidyl-tRNA site) holds the tRNA carrying the growing polypeptide chain, while the A site (aminoacyl-tRNA site) holds the tRNA carrying the next amino acid to be added to the chain. Discharged tRNAs leave the ribosome from the E site (exit site). The ribosome holds the tRNA and mRNA close together and positions the new amino acid for addition to the carboxyl end of the growing polypeptide. It then catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond.

Four decades of genetic and biochemical research on ribosome structure recently culminated in the detailed structure of the bacterial ribosome. One view of the large subunit is shown in FIGURE 17.16, and a ribbon model of the entire ribosome appears at the beginning of this chapter. Ribosome structure strongly supports the hypothesis that rRNA, not protein, carries out the ribosome's functions. RNA is the main constituent of the interface between the two subunits and of the A and P sites, and it is the catalyst of peptide bond formation. Thus, a ribosome can be regarded as one colossal ribozyme! The ribosome's proteins are largely on the exterior, apparently playing a mainly structural role.

Fig 17-16. Structure of the large ribosomal subunit at the atomic level. In 2000, researchers succeeded in determining the atomic structures of both subunits of the bacterial ribosome using X-ray crystallography (see FIGURE 5.27). This computer model shows the large subunit from a point of view different from that in FIGURE 17.15. Here we are looking at the "bottom" of the large subunit, as it would look from an attached small subunit. The rRNA molecules are colored orange or maroon (sugar-phosphate backbones) and gray (bases) and the proteins are purple. Notice that the proteins are mostly on the outside of the subunit, whereas the rRNA, responsible for the ribosome's functions, is mostly in the interior. The tRNA molecules are included for orientation.

Building a Polypeptide

We can divide translation, the synthesis of a polypeptide chain, into three stages (analogous to those of transcription): initiation, elongation, and termination. All three stages require protein "factors" that aid mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes in the translation process. For chain initiation and elongation, energy is also required. It is provided by the hydrolysis of GTP (guanosine triphosphate), a molecule closely related to ATP.

Initiation. The initiation stage of translation brings together mRNA, a tRNA bearing the first amino acid of the polypeptide, and the two subunits of a ribosome (FIGURE 17.17). First, a small ribosomal subunit binds to both mRNA and a special initiator tRNA. The small ribosomal subunit attaches to the leader segment at the 5&#39; (upstream) end of the mRNA. In bacteria, rRNA of the small subunit base-pairs with a specific sequence of nucleotides within the mRNA leader; in eukaryotes, the 5&#39; cap first tells the small subunit to attach to the 5&#39; end of the mRNA. Downstream on the mRNA is the initiation codon, AUG, which signals the start of translation. The initiator tRNA, which carries the amino acid methionine, attaches to the initiation codon.

Fig 17-17. The initiation of translation.

The union of mRNA, initiator tRNA, and a small ribosomal subunit is followed by the attachment of a large ribosomal subunit, completing a translation initiation complex. Proteins called initiation factors are required to bring all these components together. The cell also spends energy in the form of a GTP molecule to form the initiation complex. At the completion of the initiation process, the initiator tRNA sits in the P site of the ribosome, and the vacant A site is ready for the next aminoacyl tRNA. The synthesis of a polypeptide is initiated at its amino end (see FIGURE 5.16b).

Elongation. In the elongation stage of translation, amino acids are added one by one to the preceding amino acid. Each addition involves the participation of several proteins called elongation factors and occurs in a three-step cycle (FIGURE 17.18):

Fig 17-18. The elongation cycle of translation. Not shown in this diagram are the proteins called elongation factors. The hydrolysis of GTP drives the elongation process.


			  
		Codon recognition. The mRNA codon in the A site of the ribosome forms hydrogen bonds with the anticodon of an incoming molecule of tRNA carrying its appropriate amino acid. An elongation factor ushers the tRNA into the A site. This step requires the hydrolysis of two molecules of GTP.


			  
		Peptide bond formation. An rRNA molecule of the large ribosomal subunit, functioning as a ribozyme, catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond that joins the polypeptide extending from the P site to the newly arrived amino acid in the A site. In this step, the polypeptide separates from the tRNA to which it was attached, and the amino acid at its carboxyl end bonds to the amino acid carried by the tRNA in the A site.


			  
		Translocation. The ribosome now translocates (moves) the tRNA in the A site, with its attached polypeptide, to the P site. As the tRNA moves, its anticodon remains hydrogen-bonded to the mRNA codon; the mRNA moves along with it and brings the next codon to be translated into the A site. Meanwhile, the tRNA that was in the P site is moved to the E (exit) site and from there leaves the ribosome. The translocation step requires energy, which is provided by hydrolysis of a GTP molecule. The mRNA is moved through the ribosome in one direction only, 5&#39; end first; this is equivalent to the ribosome moving 5&#39; 3&#39;on the mRNA. The important point is that the ribosome and the mRNA move relative to each other, unidirectionally, codon by codon. The elongation cycle takes less than a tenth of a second and is repeated as each amino acid is added to the chain until the polypeptide is completed.

Termination. The final stage of translation is termination (FIGURE 17.19). Elongation continues until a stop codon in the mRNA reaches the A site of the ribosome. The special base triplets UAA, UAG, and UGA do not code for amino acids but instead act as signals to stop translation. A protein called a release factor binds directly to the stop codon in the A site. The release factor causes the addition of a water molecule instead of an amino acid to the polypeptide chain. This reaction hydrolyzes the completed polypeptide from the tRNA that is in the P site, freeing the polypeptide from the ribosome. The remainder of the translation assembly then comes apart.

Polyribosomes

A single ribosome can make an average-sized polypeptide in less than a minute. Typically, however, a single mRNA is used to make many copies of a polypeptide simultaneously, because a number of ribosomes work on translating the message at the same time. Once a ribosome moves past the initiation codon, a second ribosome can attach to the mRNA, and thus, multiple ribosomes may trail along the same mRNA. Such strings of ribosomes, called polyribosomes, can be seen with the electron microscope (FIGURE 17.20). Polyribosomes are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
They help a cell to make many copes of a polypeptide very quickly.

From Polypeptide to Functional Protein

During and after its synthesis, a polypeptide chain begins to coil and fold spontaneously, forming a functional protein of specific conformation: a three-dimensional molecule with secondary and tertiary structure (see FIGURE 5.24). A gene determines primary structure, and primary structure in turn determines conformation. In many cases, a chaperone protein helps the polypeptide fold correctly (see FIGURE 5.26).

Additional steps--posttranslational modifications--may be required before the protein can begin doing its particular job in the cell. Certain amino acids may be chemically modified by the attachment of sugars, lipids, phosphate groups, or other additions. Enzymes may remove one or more amino acids from the leading (amino) end of the polypeptide chain. In some cases, a single polypeptide chain may be enzymatically cleaved into two or more pieces. For example, the protein insulin is first synthesized as a single polypeptide chain but becomes active only after an enzyme cuts out a central part of the chain, leaving a protein made up of two polypeptide chains connected by disulfide bridges (see FIGURE 5.22). In other cases, two or more polypeptides that are synthesized separately may join to become the subunits of a protein that has quaternary structure.





 Signal peptides target some eukaryotic polypeptides to specific destinations in the cell

In electron micrographs of eukaryotic cells active in protein synthesis, two populations of ribosomes (and polyribosomes) are evident: free and bound (see FIGURE 7.10). Free ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol and mostly synthesize proteins that dissolve in the cytosol and function there. In contrast, bound ribosomes are attached to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They make proteins of the endomembrane system (the nuclear envelope, ER, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vacuoles, and plasma membrane) as well as proteins secreted from the cell. Insulin is an example of a secretory protein. The ribosomes themselves are identical and can switch their status from free to bound.

What determines whether a ribosome will be free in the cytosol or bound to rough ER at any particular time? The synthesis of all proteins begins in the cytosol, when a free ribosome starts to translate an mRNA molecule. There the process continues to completion--unless the growing polypeptide itself cues the ribosome to attach to the ER. The polypeptides of proteins destined for the endomembrane system or for secretion are marked by a signal peptide, which targets the protein to the ER (FIGURE 17.21). The signal peptide, a sequence of about 20 amino acids at or near the leading (amino) end of the polypeptide, is recognized as it emerges from the ribosome by a protein-RNA complex called a signal-recognition particle (SRP). This particle functions as an adapter that brings the ribosome to a receptor protein built into the ER membrane. This receptor is part of a multiprotein complex. Polypeptide synthesis continues there, and the growing polypeptide snakes across the membrane into the cisternal space via a protein pore. The signal peptide is usually removed by an enzyme. The rest of the completed polypeptide, if it is to be a secretory protein, is released into solution within the cisternal space (as in FIGURE 17.21). Alternatively, if the polypeptide is to be a membrane protein, it remains partially embedded in the ER membrane.

Fig 17-21. The signal mechanism for targeting proteins to the ER. A polypeptide destined for the endomembrane system or for secretion from the cell begins with a signal peptide, a series of amino acids that targets it for the ER. This figure shows the synthesis of a secretory protein and its simultaneous import into the ER. In the ER and then in the Golgi, the protein is further processed. Finally, a transport vesicle conveys it to the plasma membrane for release from the cell (see FIGURE 8.8).

Other kinds of signal peptides are used to target polypeptides to mitochondria, chloroplasts, the interior of the nucleus, and other organelles that are not part of the endomembrane system. The critical difference in these cases is that translation is completed in the cytosol before the polypeptide is imported into the organelle. The mechanisms of translocation also vary, but in all cases studied to date, the "postal" codes that address proteins to cellular locations are signal peptides of some sort.





 RNA plays multiple roles in the cell: a review

As we have seen, the cellular machinery of protein synthesis (and ER targeting) is dominated by RNA of various kinds. In addition to mRNA, these include tRNA, rRNA, and, in eukaryotes, snRNA and SRP RNA (TABLE 17.1). The diverse functions of these molecules range from structural to informational to catalytic. The ability of RNA to perform so many different functions is based on two related characteristics of this kind of molecule: RNA can hydrogen-bond to other nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA), and it can assume a specific three-dimen sionalshape by forming hydrogen bonds between bases in different parts of its polynucleotide chain (you saw an example of this intramolecular bonding in tRNA, FIGURE 17.13). DNA may be the genetic material of all living cells today, but RNA is much more versatile. You will learn in Chapter 18 that many viruses even use RNA rather than DNA as their genetic material.

In eukaryotes, pre-mRNA commonly contains introns, noncoding segments that are spliced out as the primary transcript is processed. Some intron RNA acts as a ribozyme, catalyzing its own splicing.Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)Plays structural and catalytic roles in spliceosomes, the complexes of protein and RNA that splice pre-mRNA in the eukaryotic nucleus.SRP RNAIs a component of the signal-recognition particle (SRP), the protein-RNA complex that recognizes the signal peptides of polypeptides targeted to the ER.



 Comparing protein synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes: a review

Although bacteria and eukaryotes carry out transcription and translation in very similar ways, we have noted certain differences in cellular machinery and in details of the processes. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases are different, and those of eukaryotes depend on transcription factors. Transcription is terminated differently in the two kinds of cells. Also, prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are slightly different. The most important differences, however, arise from the eukaryotic cell's compartmental organization. Like a oneroom workshop, a prokaryotic cell ensures a streamlined operation. In the absence of a nucleus, it can simultaneously transcribe and translate the same gene (FIGURE 17.22), and the newly made protein can quickly diffuse to its site of function. In contrast, the eukaryotic cell's nuclear envelope segregates transcription from translation and provides a compartment for extensive RNA processing. This processing stage provides additional steps whose regulation can help coordinate the eukaryotic cell's elaborate activities (see Chapter 19). Finally, as we have seen, eukaryotic cells have complicated mechanisms for targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular compartment (organelle).

Fig 17-22. Coupled transcription and translation in bacteria. In prokaryotic cells, the translation of mRNA can begin as soon as the leading (5&#39;) end of the mRNA molecule peels away from the DNA template. The micrograph shows a strand of E. coli DNA being transcribed by RNA polymerase molecules. Attached to each RNA polymerase molecule is a growing strand of mRNA, which is already being translated by ribosomes. The newly synthesized polypeptides are not visible in the micrograph (TEM).

Where did eukaryotes--and prokaryotes, for that matter--get the genes that encode the huge diversity of proteins they synthesize? For the past few billion years, the ultimate source of new genes has been the mutation of preexisting genes, the topic of the next section.





 Point mutations can affect protein structure and function

Mutations are changes in the genetic material of a cell (or virus). In FIGURE 15.13, we considered large-scale mutations, chromosomal rearrangements that affect long segments of DNA. Now that you have learned about the genetic code and its translation, we can examine point mutations, which are chemical changes in just one base pair of a gene.

If a point mutation occurs in a gamete or in a cell that gives rise to gametes, it may be transmitted to offspring and to a succession of future generations. If the mutation has an adverse effect on the phenotype of a human or other animal, the mutant condition is referred to as a genetic disorder, or hereditary disease. For example, we can trace the genetic basis of sickle-cell disease to a mutation of a single base pair in the gene that codes for one of the polypeptides of hemoglobin. The change of a single nucleotide in the DNA's template strand leads to the production of an abnormal protein (FIGURE 17.23). In individuals who are homozygous for the mutant allele, the sickling of red blood cells caused by the altered hemoglobin produces the multiple symptoms associated with sickle-cell disease (see FIGURE 14.15). Let's see how different types of point mutations translate into altered proteins.

Types of Point Mutations

Point mutations within a gene can be divided into two general categories: base-pair substitutions and base-pair insertions or deletions. While reading about how these mutations affect proteins, refer to the appropriate parts of FIGURE 17.24.

Fig 17-24. Categories and consequences of point mutations. Mutations are changes in DNA, but they are represented here as they are reflected in mRNA and its protein product. Strictly speaking, the example at the lower left is not a point mutation because it involves insertion or deletion of more than one nucleotide.

Substitutions. A base-pair substitution is the replacement of one nucleotide and its partner in the complementary DNA strand with another pair of nucleotides. Some substitutions are called silent mutations because, owing to the redundancy of the genetic code, they have no effect on the encoded protein. In other words, a change in a base pair may transform one codon into another that is translated into the same amino acid. For example, if CCG mutated to CCA, the mRNA codon that used to be GGC would become GGU, and a glycine would still be inserted at the proper location in the protein (see FIGURE 17.4). Other changes of a single nucleotide pair may switch an amino acid but have little effect on the protein. The new amino acid may have properties similar to those of the amino acid it replaces, or it may be in a region of the protein where the exact sequence of amino acids is not essential to the protein's function.

However, the base-pair substitutions of greatest interest are those that cause a readily detectable change in a protein. The alteration of a single amino acid in a crucial area of a protein--in the active site of an enzyme, for example--will significantly alter protein activity. Occasionally, such a mutation leads to an improved protein or one with novel capabilities that enhance the success of the mutant organism and its descendants. But much more often such mutations are detrimental, creating a useless or less active protein that impairs cellular function.

Substitution mutations are usually missense mutations; that is, the altered codon still codes for an amino acid and thus makes sense, although not necessarily the right sense. But if a point mutation changes a codon for an amino acid into a stop codon, translation will be terminated prematurely, and the resulting polypeptide will be shorter than the polypeptide encoded by the normal gene. Alterations that change an amino acid codon to a stop signal are called nonsense mutations, and nearly all nonsense mutations lead to nonfunctional proteins.

Insertions and Deletions. Insertions and deletions are additions or losses of nucleotide pairs in a gene. These mutations have a disastrous effect on the resulting protein more often than substitutions do. Because mRNA is read as a series of nucleotide triplets during translation, the insertion or deletion of nucleotides may alter the reading frame (triplet grouping) of the genetic message. Such a mutation, called a frameshift mutation, will occur whenever the number of nucleotides inserted or deleted is not a multiple of three. All the nucleotides that are downstream of the deletion or insertion will be improperly grouped into codons, and the result will be extensive missense ending sooner or later in nonsense--premature termination. Unless the frameshift is very near the end of the gene, it will produce a protein that is almost certain to be nonfunctional.

Mutagens

The production of mutations can occur in a number of ways. Errors during DNA replication, repair, or recombination can lead to base-pair substitutions, insertions, or deletions, as well as to mutations affecting longer stretches of DNA. Mutations resulting from such errors are called spontaneous mutations.

A number of physical and chemical agents, called mutagens, interact with DNA to cause mutations. In the 1920s, Hermann Muller discovered that if he subjected fruit flies to X-rays, genetic changes increased in frequency. Using this method, Muller was able to obtain mutants of Drosophila that he could use in his genetic studies. But he also recognized an alarming implication of his discovery: Because they are mutagens, X-rays and other forms of high-energy radiation pose hazards to the genetic material of people as well as laboratory organisms. Mutagenic radiation, a physical mutagen, includes ultraviolet (UV) light, which can produce disruptive thymine dimers in DNA (see FIGURE 16.17).

Chemical mutagens fall into several categories. Base analogues are chemicals that are similar to normal DNA bases but that pair incorrectly during DNA replication. Some other chemical mutagens interfere with correct DNA replication by inserting themselves into the DNA and distorting the double helix. Still other mutagens cause chemical changes in bases that change their pairing properties.

Researchers have developed various methods to test the mutagenic activity of different chemicals. A major application of these tests is the preliminary screening of chemicals to identify those that may cause cancer. This approach makes sense because most carcinogens (cancer-causing chemicals) are mutagenic and, conversely, most mutagens are carcinogenic.





 What is a gene? revisiting the question

Our definition of a gene has evolved over the past few chapters, as it has through the history of genetics. We began with the Mendelian concept of a gene as a discrete unit of inheritance that affects a phenotypic character (Chapter 14). We saw that Morgan and his colleagues assigned such genes to specific loci on chromosomes and that geneticists sometimes use the term locus as a synonym for gene (Chapter 15). We went on to view a gene as a region of specific nucleotide sequence along the length of a DNA molecule (Chapter 16). Finally, in this chapter, we have moved toward a functional definition of a gene as a DNA sequence coding for a specific polypeptide chain. All these definitions are useful, depending on the context in which genes are being studied. (FIGURE 17.25 summarizes the path from gene to polypeptide in a eukaryotic cell.)



Click image to enlarge



Fig 17-25. A summary of transcription and translation in a eukaryotic cell. This diagram shows the path from one gene to one polypeptide. Keep in mind that each gene in the DNA can be transcribed repeatedly into many RNA molecules, and that each mRNA can be translated repeatedly to yield many polypeptides. (Also, remember that the final products of some genes are not polypeptides but RNA molecules, including tRNA and rRNA.) In general, the steps of transcription and translation are similar in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The major difference is the occurrence of mRNA processing in the eukaryotic nucleus. Other significant differences are found in the initiation stages of both transcription and translation and in the termination of transcription.

Even the one gene-one polypeptide definition must be refined and applied selectively. Most eukaryotic genes contain noncoding segments (introns), so large portions of these genes have no corresponding segments in polypeptides. Mo-lec-ular biologists also often include promoters and certain other regulatory regions of DNA within the boundaries of a gene. These DNA sequences are not transcribed, but they can be considered part of the functional gene because they must be present for transcription to occur. Our molecular definition of a gene must also be broad enough to include the DNA that is transcribed into rRNA, tRNA, and other RNAs that are not translated. These genes have no polypeptide products. Thus, we arrive at the following definition: A gene is a region of DNA whose final product is either a polypeptide or an RNA molecule.

For most genes, however, it is still useful to retain the one gene-one polypeptide idea. In this chapter, you have learned in molecular terms how a typical gene is expressed--by transcription into RNA and then translation into a polypeptide that forms a protein of specific structure and function. Proteins, in turn, bring about an organism's observable phenotype.

Genes are subject to regulation. The control of gene expression enables a bacterium, for example, to vary the amounts of particular enzymes as the metabolic needs of the cell change. In multicellular eukaryotes, the control of gene expression makes it possible for cells with the same DNA to diverge during their development into different cell types, such as muscle and nerve cells in animals. We will explore the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes in Chapters 19 and 21. In the next chapter, we begin our discussion of gene regulation by focusing on the simpler molecular biology of bacteria and viruses.

The drawing that opens this chapter dramatizes a remarkable event: the genetic takeover of a cell by a virus. In this case, the cell is the bacterium E. coli, and the virus, looking something like a miniature lunar landing craft, is the bacteriophage T4. The phage is infecting the cell by injecting its DNA. InFIGURE 16.2, you met a closely related virus, T2, which helped prove that DNA is the genetic material. Molecular biology was born in the laboratories of microbiologists studying such viruses and bacteria. Microbiologists provided most of the evidence that genes are made of DNA, and they worked out the major steps of DNA replication, transcription, and translation, the three main processes in the flow of genetic information. Viruses and bacteria are the simplest biological systems--microbial models where scientists find life's fundamental molecular mechanisms in their most basic, accessible forms.

The value of viruses and bacteria as model systems in biological research is just one reason to learn about these microbes. While microbial models have helped biologists understand the molecular genetics of more complex organisms, viruses and bacteria also have unique features that make their genetics interesting in their own right. These specialized mechanisms have important applications for understanding how viruses and bacteria cause disease. In addition, techniques enabling scientists to manipulate genes and transfer them from one organism to another have emerged from the study of microbes. These techniques are having an important impact on both basic research and biotechnology (see Chapter 20).

In this chapter, we explore the genetics of viruses and bacteria. Recall that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms, with cells much smaller and more simply organized than those of eukaryotes, such as plants and animals. Viruses are smaller and simpler still, lacking the structures and most of the metabolic machinery found in cells (FIGURE 18.1). In fact, most viruses are little more than aggregates of nucleic acid and protein--genes packaged in protein coats. It is with these simplest of all genetic systems that we begin.

 Researchers discovered viruses by studying a plant disease

Microbiologists were able to detect viruses indirectly long before they were actually able to see them. The story of how viruses were discovered begins in 1883 with Adolf Mayer, a German scientist seeking the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. This disease stunts the growth of tobacco plants and gives their leaves a mottled, or mosaic, coloration (see FIGURE 18.9a). Mayer discovered that the disease was contagious when he found he could transmit it from plant to plant by spraying sap extracted from diseased leaves onto healthy plants. He searched for a microbe in the infectious sap but found none. Mayer concluded that the disease was caused by unusually small bacteria that could not be seen with the microscope. This hypothesis was tested a decade later by Dimitri Ivanowsky, a Russian who passed sap from infected tobacco leaves through a filter designed to remove bacteria. After filtering, the sap still produced mosaic disease.

Fig 18-9. Viral infection of plants.

Ivanowsky clung to the hypothesis that bacteria caused tobacco mosaic disease. Perhaps, he reasoned, the pathogenic bacteria were so small they could pass through the filter. Or perhaps the bacteria made a filterable toxin that caused the disease. This latter possibility was ruled out in 1897 when the Dutch botanist Martinus Beijerinck discovered that the infectious agent in the filtered sap could reproduce. Beijerinck sprayed plants with the filtered sap, and after these plants developed mosaic disease, he used their sap to infect more plants, continuing this process through a series of infections. The pathogen must have been reproducing, for its ability to cause disease was undiluted after several transfers from plant to plant.

In fact, the pathogen could reproduce only within the host it infected. Unlike bacteria, the mysterious agent of mosaic disease could not be cultivated on nutrient media in test tubes or petri dishes. Also, the pathogen was not inactivated by alcohol, which is generally lethal to bacteria. Beijerinck imagined a reproducing particle much smaller and simpler than bacteria. His suspicions were confirmed in 1935, when the American scientist Wendell Stanley crystallized the infectious particle, now known as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Subsequently, TMV and many other viruses were actually seen with the help of the electron microscope.

The tiniest viruses are only 20 nm in diameter--smaller than a ribosome. Millions could easily fit on a pinhead. Even the largest viruses can barely be resolved with the light microscope. Stanley's discovery that some viruses could be crystallized was exciting and puzzling news. Not even the simplest of cells can aggregate into regular crystals. But if viruses are not cells, then what are they? They are infectious particles consisting of nucleic acid enclosed in a protein coat and, in some cases, a membranous envelope. Let's examine the structure of viruses more closely; then we'll look at how viruses replicate.

Viral Genomes

We usually think of genes as being made of double-stranded DNA--the conventional double helix--but many viruses defy this convention. Their genomes may consist of double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, or single-stranded RNA, depending on the specific type of virus. A virus is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, according to the kind of nucleic acid that makes up its genome. In either case, the genome is usually organized as a single linear or circular molecule of nucleic acid. The smallest viruses have only four genes, while the largest have several hundred.

Capsids and Envelopes

The protein shell that encloses the viral genome is called a capsid. Depending on the type of virus, the capsid may be rod-shaped (more precisely, helical), polyhedral, or more complex in shape. Capsids are built from a large number of protein subunits called capsomeres, but the number of different kinds of proteins is usually small. Tobacco mosaic virus, for example, has a rigid, rod-shaped capsid made from over a thousand molecules of a single type of protein (FIGURE 18.2a, p. 330). Adenoviruses, which infect the respiratory tracts of animals, have 252 identical protein molecules arranged into a polyhedral capsid with 20 triangular facets--an icosahedron (FIGURE 18.2b).

Fig 18-2. Viral structure. Viruses are made up of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein coat (the capsid) and sometimes further wrapped in a membranous envelope. The individual protein subunits making up the capsid are called capsomeres. Although viruses are diverse in size and shape, there are common structural motifs, most of which appear in the four examples shown here. (All the micrographs are TEMs.)

Some viruses have accessory structures that help them infect their hosts. Influenza viruses, as well as many other viruses found in animals, have viral envelopes, membranes cloaking their capsids (FIGURE 18.2c). These envelopes are derived from membrane of the host cell, but in addition to host cell phospholipids and proteins, they also contain proteins and glycoproteins of viral origin (glycoproteins are proteins with carbohydrate covalently attached). Some viruses carry a few viral enzyme molecules within their capsids.

The most complex capsids are found among viruses that infect bacteria. As you learned in Chapter 16, bacterial viruses are called bacteriophages, or simply phages. The first phages studied included seven that infect the bacterium Escherichia coli. These seven phages were named type 1 (T1), type 2 (T2), and so forth, in the order of their discovery. By coincidence, the three T-even phages--T2, T4, and T6--turned out to be very similar in structure. Their capsids have elongated 20-sided heads that enclose their DNA. Attached to the head is a protein tail piece with tail fibers that the phages use to attach to a bacterium (FIGURE 18.2d).





 Viruses can reproduce only within a host cell: an overview

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites; that is, they can reproduce only within a host cell. An isolated virus is unable to reproduce--or do anything else, for that matter, except infect an appropriate host cell. Viruses lack the enzymes for metabolism and have no ribosomes or other equipment for making their own proteins. Thus, isolated viruses are merely packaged sets of genes in transit from one host cell to another.

Each type of virus can infect and parasitize only a limited range of host cells, called its host range. This host specificity depends on the evolution of recognition systems by the virus. Viruses identify their host cells by a "lock-and-key" fit between proteins on the outside of the virus and specific receptor molecules on the surface of the cell. (Presumably, the receptors first evolved because they carried out functions of benefit to the organism.) Some viruses have host ranges broad enough to include several species. Swine flu virus, for example, can infect both hogs and humans, and the rabies virus can infect a number of mammalian species, including raccoons, skunks, dogs, and humans. In other cases, viruses have host ranges so narrow that they infect only a single species. For instance, there are several phages that can parasitize only E. coli.

Viruses of eukaryotes are usually tissue specific. Human cold viruses infect only the cells lining the upper respiratory tract, ignoring other tissues. And the AIDS virus binds to a specific receptor on certain types of white blood cells.

A viral infection begins when the genome of a virus makes its way into a host cell (FIGURE 18.3). The mechanism by which this nucleic acid enters the cell varies, depending on the type of virus. For example, the T-even phages use their elaborate tail apparatus to inject DNA into a bacterium (see the chapter-opening drawing on p. 328). Once inside, the viral genome can commandeer its host, reprogramming the cell to copy the viral nucleic acid and manufacture viral proteins. Most DNA viruses use the DNA polymerases of the host cell to synthesize new genomes along the templates provided by the viral DNA. In contrast, to replicate their genomes, RNA viruses must use special virus-encoded polymerases, ones that can use RNA as a template. (Cells generally have no native enzymes for carrying out such a process.) We will describe the replication of DNA and RNA viruses in more detail later in the chapter.

Fig 18-3. A simplified viral reproductive cycle. A virus is an obligate intracellular parasite that uses the equipment of its host cell to reproduce. In this simplest of viral cycles, the parasite is a DNA virus with a capsid consisting of a single type of protein. 
			  
		 After entering the cell, the viral DNA uses host nucleotides and enzymes to replicate itself. 
			  
		 The viral DNA uses other host resources to produce its capsid proteins by transcription and translation. 
			  
		 The new viral DNA and capsid proteins assemble into new virus particles, which leave the cell.

Regardless of the type of viral genome, the parasite diverts its host's resources for viral production. The host provides the nucleotides for nucleic acid synthesis. It also provides enzymes, ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, ATP, and other components needed for making the viral proteins dictated by viral genes.

After the viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres are produced, their assembly into new viruses is often a spontaneous process, a process of self-assembly. In fact, the RNA and capsomeres of TMV can be separated in the laboratory and then reassembled to form complete viruses simply by mixing the components together again. The simplest type of viral reproductive cycle is completed when hundreds or thousands of viruses emerge from the infected host cell. The cell is often destroyed in the process. In fact, some of the symptoms of human viral infections, such as colds and influenza, result from cellular damage and death and from the body's responses to this destruction. The viral progeny that exit a cell have the potential to infect additional cells, spreading the viral infection.

There are many variations on the simplified viral reproductive cycle we have traced in this overview. We will see several examples as we take a closer look at some bacterial viruses (phages), animal viruses, and plant viruses.





 Phages reproduce using lytic or lysogenic cycles

The phages are the best understood of all viruses, although some of them are also among the most complex. Research on phages led to the discovery that some double-stranded DNA viruses can reproduce by two alternative mechanisms: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.

The Lytic Cycle

A phage reproductive cycle that culminates in death of the host cell is known as a lytic cycle. The term refers to the last stage of infection, during which the bacterium lyses (breaks open) and releases the phages that were produced within the cell. Each of these phages can then infect a healthy cell, and a few successive lytic cycles can destroy an entire bacterial colony in just hours. A phage that reproduces only by a lytic cycle is a virulent phage. FIGURE 18.4 (p. 332) uses the virulent phage T4 to illustrate the steps of a lytic cycle. The figure and legend describe the process, which you should study before proceeding.

Fig 18-4. The lytic cycle of phage T4. Phage T4 has about 100 genes, which are transcribed and translated using the host cell's machinery. One of the first phage genes translated after infection codes for an enzyme that chops up the host cell's DNA (step 3); the phage DNA is protected from breakdown because it contains a modified form of cytosine that is not recognized by the enzyme. The entire lytic cycle, from the phage's first contact with the cell surface to cell lysis, takes only 20-30 minutes at 37&#176;C.

After reading about the lytic cycle, you may wonder why phages haven't exterminated all bacteria. Actually, bacteria are not defenseless. Natural selection favors bacterial mutants with receptor sites that are no longer recognized by a particular type of phage. And when phage DNA successfully enters a bacterium, various cellular enzymes may break it down. Enzymes called restriction nucleases, for example, recognize and cut up DNA that is foreign to the cell, including certain phage DNA. The bacterial cell's own DNA is chemically modified in a way that prevents attack by restriction enzymes. But just as natural selection favors bacteria with effective restriction enzymes, natural selection favors phage mutants that are resistant to these enzymes. Thus, the parasite-host relationship is in constant evolutionary flux.

There is still another important reason bacteria have been spared from extinction as a result of phage activity. Many phages can check their own destructive tendencies and, instead of lysing their host cells, coexist with them in what is called the lysogenic cycle.

The Lysogenic Cycle

In contrast to the lytic cycle, which kills the host cell, the lysogenic cycle replicates the phage genome without destroying the host. Phages that are capable of using both modes of reproducing within a bacterium are called temperate phages. To compare the lytic and lysogenic cycles, we will examine a temperate phage called lambda, written with the Greek letter l. Phage l resembles T4, but its tail has only one short tail fiber.

Infection of an E. coli cell by phage l begins when the phage binds to the surface of the cell and injects its DNA (FIGURE 18.5). Within the host, the l DNA molecule forms a circle. What happens next depends on the reproductive mode: lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle. During a lytic cycle, the viral genes immediately turn the host cell into a l-producing factory, and the cell soon lyses and releases its viral products. The viral genome behaves differently during a lysogenic cycle. The l DNA molecule is incorporated by genetic recombination (crossing over) into a specific site on the host cell's chromosome. It is then known as a prophage. One prophage gene codes for a protein that represses most of the other prophage genes. (This is the repressor protein Nancy Hopkins studied as a graduate student; see p. 232.) Thus, the phage genome is mostly silent within the bacterium. How, then, does the phage reproduce? Every time the E. coli cell prepares to divide, it replicates the phage DNA along with its own and passes the copies on to daughter cells. A single infected cell can quickly give rise to a large population of bacteria carrying the virus in prophage form. This mechanism enables viruses to propagate without killing the host cells on which they depend.

Fig 18-5. The lysogenic and lytic reproductive cycles of phage l, a temper-ate phage. After entering the bacterial cell and circularizing, the l DNA can either integrate into the bacterial chromosome (lysogenic cycle) or immediately initiate the production of a large number of progeny phages (lytic cycle). In most cases, the lytic pathway is followed, but once a lysogenic cycle begins, the prophage may be carried in the host cell's chromosome for many generations. Phage l has a single, short tail fiber, not shown in this diagram.

The term lysogenic implies that prophages are capable of giving rise to active phages that lyse their host cells. This occurs when, occasionally, the l genome exits the bacterial chromosome. Once free in the cell, the l genome initiates a lytic cycle. It is usually an environmental trigger, such as radiation or the presence of certain chemicals, that switches the virus from the lysogenic to the lytic mode.

In addition to the gene for the repressor protein, a few other prophage genes may also be expressed during lysogenic cycles, and the expression of these genes may alter the phenotype of the host bacteria. This phenomenon can have important medical significance. For example, the bacteria that cause the human diseases diphtheria, botulism, and scarlet fever would be harmless to humans if it were not for certain prophage genes that induce the host bacteria to make toxins.





 Animal viruses are diverse in their modes of infection and replication

Everyone has suffered from viral infections, whether cold sores, influenza, or the common cold. TABLE 18.1 (p. 334) lists some important classes of animal viruses. Like all viruses, those that cause illness in humans and other animals can reproduce (replicate) only inside host cells.

Reproductive Cycles of Animal Viruses

Many variations on the basic scheme of viral infection and reproduction are represented among the animal viruses. One key variable is the type of nucleic acid that serves as a virus's genetic material (the basis for classification in TABLE 18.1). Another variable is the presence or absence of a membranous envelope. Rather than consider all the mechanisms of viral infection and reproduction, we will focus on the roles of viral envelopes and on the functioning of RNA as the genetic material of many viruses.

Table 18-1. Classes of Animal Viruses, Grouped by Type of Nucleic Acid

An animal virus equipped with an outer membrane, or viral envelope, uses it to enter the host cell (FIGURE 18.6). This membrane is generally a lipid bilayer, like a cellular membrane, with glycoproteins protruding from the outer surface. The glycoprotein spikes bind to specific receptor molecules on the surface of a host cell. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's plasma membrane, transporting the capsid and viral genome into the cell. After cellular enzymes remove the capsid, the viral genome can replicate and direct the synthesis of viral proteins, including glycoproteins for new viral envelopes. The endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell makes these glycoproteins, which in most cases are transported to the plasma membrane. There they are clustered in patches that serve as exit points for the viral progeny. The new viruses bud from the cell surface at these points, in a process much like exocytosis, wrapping themselves in membrane as they go. In other words, the viral envelope is derived from the host cell's plasma membrane, although some of the molecules of this membrane are specified by viral genes. The enveloped viruses are now free to spread the infection to other cells. This reproductive cycle does not necessarily kill the host cell, in contrast to the lytic cycles of phages.

Fig 18-6. The reproductive cycle of an enveloped virus. The virus shown here has a genome of single-stranded RNA (class V in TABLE 18.1). 
			  
		 Glycoproteins on the viral envelope recognize and bind to specific receptor molecules (not shown) on the surface of the host cell. 
			  
		 The viral envelope fuses with the cell's plasma membrane, and the capsid and viral genome enter the cell. 
			  
		 Cellular enzymes remove the capsid. 
			  
		 The viral genome functions as a template for making complementary RNA strands (lighter color), which have two functions: 
			  
		 They serve as templates for making new copies of genome RNA, and 
			  
		 they serve as mRNA. The mRNA is translated into both capsid proteins and glycoproteins for the viral envelope. The cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) synthesizes the glycoproteins. 
			  
		 Vesicles transport the glycoproteins to the cell's plasma membrane. 
			  
		 A capsid assembles around each viral genome molecule. 
			  
		 The virus buds from the cell. Its envelope, studded with viral glycoproteins, is derived from the cell's plasma membrane.

Some viruses have envelopes that are not derived from plasma membrane. Herpesviruses, for example, have envelopes derived from the nuclear membrane of the host. The genomes of herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA, and these viruses reproduce within the cell nucleus, using a combination of viral and cellular enzymes to replicate and transcribe their DNA. While within the nucleus, herpesvirus DNA may become integrated into the cell's genome as a provirus, similar to a bacterial prophage. Once acquired, herpes infections (which may cause cold sores or genital sores, for instance) tend to recur throughout a person's life. Between these episodes, the virus apparently remains latent within the host cells' nuclei. From time to time, physical or emotional stress may cause the herpes proviruses to leave the host's genome and initiate active virus production, resulting in the blisters of active infections.

RNA as Viral Genetic Material. Although some phages and most plant viruses are RNA viruses, the broadest variety of RNA genomes is found among the viruses that infect animals. As TABLE 18.1 indicates, RNA viruses are classified according to the strandedness of their RNA and how it functions in a host cell. Notice that there are three types of single-stranded RNA genomes (classes IV-VI). The genome of class IV viruses can directly serve as mRNA and thus can be translated into viral protein immediately after infection. (How do you suppose new RNA genomes are made?) FIGURE 18.6 shows a virus of class V, in which the RNA genome serves as a template for mRNA synthesis. The RNA genome is transcribed into a strand of complementary RNA, which serves both as mRNA and as template for the synthesis of additional copies of genome RNA. Like all viruses that require RNA  RNA synthesis to make mRNA, this one uses a viral enzyme that is packaged with the genome inside the capsid.

The RNA viruses with the most complicated reproductive cycles are the retroviruses (class VI). Retro, meaning "backward," refers to the reverse direction in which genetic information flows for these viruses. Retroviruses are equipped with an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which transcribes DNA from an RNA template, providing an RNA  DNA information flow. The newly made DNA then integrates as a provirus into a chromosome within the nucleus of the animal cell. The host's RNA polymerase transcribes the viral DNA into RNA molecules, which can function both as mRNA for the synthesis of viral proteins and as genomes for new virus particles released from the cell. A retrovirus of particular importance is HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). FIGURE 18.7a (p. 336) shows the structure of HIV, and FIGURE 18.7b traces its reproductive cycle, which is typical of a retrovirus. We will postpone a detailed discussion of AIDS until Chapter 43.

Causes and Prevention of Viral Diseases in Animals

The link between a viral infection and the symptoms it produces is often obscure. Some viruses damage or kill cells by causing the release of hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes. Some viruses cause the infected cells to produce toxins that lead to disease symptoms, and some have molecular components that are toxic, such as envelope proteins. How much damage a virus causes depends partly on the ability of the infected tissue to regenerate by cell division. We usually recover completely from colds because the epithelium of the respiratory tract, which the viruses infect, can efficiently repair itself. In contrast, the poliovirus attacks nerve cells, which do not divide and cannot be replaced. Polio's damage to such cells, unfortunately, is permanent. Many of the temporary symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever, aches, and inflammation, actually result from the body's own efforts at defending itself against the infection.

As we will see in Chapter 43, the immune system is a complex and critical part of the body's natural defense mechanisms. The immune system is also the basis for the major medical weapon for preventing viral infections--vaccines. Vaccines are harmless variants or derivatives of pathogenic microbes that stimulate the immune system to mount defenses against the actual pathogen.

The term vaccine is derived from vacca, the Latin word for cow; the first vaccine, against smallpox, consisted of cowpox virus. In the late 1700s, Edward Jenner, an English physician, learned from his patients in farm country that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox (a milder disease, which usually infects cows) were resistant to subsequent smallpox infections. In his famous experiment in 1796, Jenner scratched a farmboy with a needle bearing fluid from a sore of a milkmaid who had cowpox. When the boy was later exposed to smallpox, he resisted the disease.

The cowpox and smallpox viruses are so similar that the immune system cannot distinguish them. Vaccination with the cowpox virus sensitizes the immune system to react vigorously if it is ever exposed to actual smallpox virus. Vaccination has eradicated smallpox, which was once a devastating scourge in many parts of the world. Effective vaccines have also been developed against many other viral diseases, including polio, rubella, measles, mumps, and hepatitis B.

Although vaccines can prevent certain viral illnesses, medical technology can do little, at present, to cure most viral infections once they occur. The antibiotics that help us recover from bacterial infections are powerless against viruses. Antibiotics kill bacteria by inhibiting enzymes or processes specific to the pathogens, but viruses have few or no enzymes of their own. However, a few drugs have been found that do combat viruses, mostly by interfering with viral nucleic acid synthesis. One such drug is AZT, which inhibits HIV reproduction by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase. Another is acyclovir, which inhibits herpesvirus DNA synthesis.

Emerging Viruses

HIV, the AIDS virus, seemed to make a sudden appearance in the early 1980s. In 1993, dozens of people in the southwestern United States died from hantavirus infection, which the news media first described as a "new" disease. The deadly Ebola virus (FIGURE 18.8a) has menaced the peoples of central Africa periodically since its initial recognition in 1976. The Ebola virus is only one of several recently recognized viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever, an often fatal syndrome characterized by fever, vomiting, massive bleeding, and circulatory system collapse. A number of other dangerous new viruses cause encephalitis, inflammation of the brain. One example is the Nipah virus, which in 1999 killed 105 people in Malaysia and destroyed the country's pig industry. And each year, new strains of influenza virus cause millions to miss work or classes, and deaths from flu are not uncommon. From where or what do these and other "emerging viruses" arise?



Click image to enlarge



Fig 18-8. Emerging viruses. The term emerging viruses is used for viruses that have recently appeared or recently come to the attention of medical scientists. These colorized TEMs show two such viruses.

Three processes contribute to the emergence of viral diseases. First, the mutation of existing viruses is a major source of new viral diseases. RNA viruses tend to have an unusually high rate of mutation because the replication of their nucleic acid does not involve the proofreading steps of DNA replication. Some mutations enable existing viruses to evolve into new genetic varieties that can cause disease in individuals who had developed immunity to the ancestral virus. Flu epidemics are caused by viruses that are genetically different enough from earlier years' viruses that people have little immunity to them.

Another source of new viral diseases is the spread of existing viruses from one host species to another. Scientists estimate that about three-quarters of new human diseases have originated in other animals. For example, hantavirus (FIGURE 18.8b) is common in rodents, especially deer mice. The population of deer mice in the southwestern United States exploded in 1993 after unusually wet weather increased the rodents' food supply. Humans acquired hantavirus when they inhaled dust containing traces of urine and feces from infected mice.

Finally, the dissemination of a viral disease from a small, isolated population can lead to widespread epidemics. AIDS, for example, went unnamed and virtually unnoticed for decades before it began to spread around the world. In this case, technological and social factors, including affordable international travel, blood transfusion technology, sexual promiscuity, and the abuse of intravenous drugs, allowed a previously rare human disease to become a global scourge.

Thus, emerging viruses are generally not new, but are existing viruses that expand their host territory by evolving, by spreading to new host species, or by disseminating more widely in the current host species. Environmental change can increase the viral traffic responsible for emerging diseases. For example, new roads through remote areas can allow viruses to spread between previously isolated human populations. Another problem is the destruction of forests to expand crop land, an environmental disturbance that brings humans into contact with other animals that may host viruses capable of infecting humans.

Viruses and Cancer

Since 1911, when Peyton Rous discovered a virus that causes cancer in chickens, scientists have recognized that some viruses can cause cancer in animals. We know that these tumor viruses include members of the retrovirus, papovavirus, ade-no-virus, and herpesvirus groups (see TABLE 18.1).

There is strong evidence that viruses cause certain types of human cancer. The virus responsible for hepatitis B also seems to cause liver cancer in individuals with chronic hepatitis. And the Epstein-Barr virus, the herpesvirus that causes infectious mononucleosis, has been linked to several types of cancer prevalent in parts of Africa, notably Burkitt's lymphoma. Pap-illoma viruses (of the papovavirus group) have been associated with cancer of the cervix. Among the retroviruses, one called HTLV-1 causes a type of adult leukemia. All tumor viruses transform cells into cancer cells through the integration of viral nucleic acid into host cell DNA.

Scientists have identified a number of viral genes directly involved in triggering cancerous characteristics in cells. Many of these genes, called oncogenes, are not unique to tumor viruses or tumor cells; versions of these genes, called proto-oncogenes, are also found in normal cells. Proto-oncogenes generally code for proteins that affect the cell cycle, such as growth factors and proteins involved in growth factor action (for example, growth factor receptors). In some cases, the tumor virus lacks oncogenes and transforms the cell simply by turning on or increasing the expression of one or more of the cell's proto-oncogenes. Whatever the mechanism by which a particular virus causes cancer, there is evidence that more than one change must occur in a cell's genome to transform the cell into a fully cancerous state. It is likely that most tumor viruses cause cancer only in combination with other, mutagenic events, such as exposure to mutagens or mistakes in DNA replication or repair. (Cancer is covered further in Chapter 19.)





 Plant viruses are serious agricultural pests

Plant viruses can stunt plant growth and diminish crop yields (FIGURE 18.9a). Most plant viruses discovered thus far are RNA viruses. Many of them, including the tobacco mosaic virus, have rod-shaped capsids with protein arranged in a spiral (see FIGURE 18.2a).

There are two major routes by which a plant viral disease can spread. By the first route, called horizontal transmission, a plant is infected from an external source of the virus. Since the invading virus must get past the plant's outer protective layer of cells (the epidermis), the plant becomes more susceptible to viral infections if it has been damaged by wind, chilling, injury, or insects. Insects are a double threat, because they often also act as carriers of viruses, transmitting disease from plant to plant. Farmers and gardeners may transmit plant viruses inadvertently on pruning shears and other tools. The other route of viral infection is vertical transmission, in which a plant inherits a viral infection from a parent. Vertical transmission can occur in asexual propagation (for example, by taking cuttings) or in sexual reproduction via infected seeds.

Once a virus enters a plant cell and begins reproducing, virus particles can spread throughout the plant by passing through plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic connections that penetrate the walls between adjacent plant cells (FIGURE 18.9b). Agricultural scientists have not yet devised cures for most viral diseases of plants. Therefore, their efforts have focused largely on reducing the incidence and transmission of such diseases and on breeding genetic varieties of crop plants that are relatively resistant to certain viruses.





 Viroids and prions are infectious agents even simpler than viruses

As small and simple as viruses are, they dwarf another class of pathogens, viroids. These are tiny molecules of naked circular RNA that infect plants. Only several hundred nucleotides long, viroids do not encode proteins but can replicate in host plant cells, apparently using cellular enzymes. Somehow, these RNA molecules can disrupt the metabolism of a plant cell and stunt the growth of the whole plant. One viroid disease has killed over 10 million coconut palms in the Philippines. Viroids seem to cause errors in the regulatory systems that control plant growth, and the symptoms that are typically associated with viroid diseases are abnormal development and stunted growth.

An important lesson from viroids is that a molecule can be an infectious agent that spreads a disease. But viroids are nucleic acid, whose ability to replicate is well known. More difficult to explain is the evidence for infectious proteins, called prions. Prions appear to cause a number of degenerative brain diseases, including scrapie in sheep, the "mad cow disease" that has plagued the European beef industry in recent years, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. How can a protein, which cannot replicate itself, be a transmissible pathogen? According to the leading hypothesis, a prion is a misfolded form of a protein normally present in brain cells. When the prion gets into a cell containing the normal form of the protein, the prion converts the normal protein to the prion version (FIGURE 18.10). In this way, prions may repeatedly trigger chain reactions that increase their numbers. American scientist Stanley Prusiner has long championed the prion hypothesis and in 1997 was awarded a Nobel Prize for his research in this area. Today, mounting evidence supports the pathogenic role of prions in animal diseases and the hypothesis depicted in FIGURE 18.10.

Fig 18-10. A hypothesis to explain how prions propagate. Prions are misfolded versions of normal brain proteins. When a prion contacts a normal "twin," it may induce the normal protein to assume the abnormal shape. The resulting chain reaction may continue until prions accumulate to dangerous levels, causing cellular malfunction and eventual degeneration of the brain.





 Viruses may have evolved from other mobile genetic elements

Viruses are in the semantic fog between life and nonlife. Do we think of them as nature's most complex molecules or as the simplest forms of life? Either way, we must bend our usual definitions. An isolated virus is biologically inert, unable to replicate its genes or regenerate its own supply of ATP. Yet it has a genetic program written in the universal language of life. Although viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that cannot reproduce independently, it is hard to deny their evolutionary connection to the living world.

How did viruses originate? Because they depend on cells for their own propagation, it is reasonable to assume that viruses are not the descendants of precellular prototypes of life, but evolved after the first cells appeared. Most molecular biologists favor the hypothesis that viruses originated from fragments of cellular nucleic acids that could move from one cell to another. Consistent with this idea is the observation that a viral genome usually has more in common with the genome of its host than with the genomes of viruses infecting other hosts. Indeed, some viral genes are essentially identical to genes of the host, as in the case of oncogenes, for example. Perhaps the earliest viruses were naked bits of nucleic acid, similar to plant viroids, that made it from one cell to another via injured cell surfaces. The evolution of genes coding for capsid proteins may have facilitated the infection of undamaged cells.

Candidates for the original sources of viral genomes include two kinds of cellular genetic elements, plasmids and transposons. Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that are separate from chromosomes. They are found in bacteria and also in yeasts, which are unicellular eukaryotes. Plasmids, like most viruses, can replicate independently of the rest of the cell's genome and are occasionally transferred between cells. Transposons are DNA segments that can move from one location to another within a cell's genome. Thus, plasmids, transposons, and viruses all share an important feature: They are mobile genetic elements. (We will discuss plasmids and transposons in more detail later in the chapter.)

It is the evolutionary relationship between viruses and the genomes of their host cells that makes viruses such useful model systems in molecular biology. By studying how the replication of viruses is controlled, researchers are learning more about the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication and gene expression (transcription and translation) in cells. Bacteria are equally valuable as microbial models in genetics research, but for different reasons. Unlike viruses, bacteria are true cells. But as prokaryotic cells, bacteria provide researchers with the opportunity to investigate molecular genetics in the simplest organisms. In fact, E. coli, the bacterium sometimes called "the laboratory rat of molecular biology," is the most completely understood of all organisms at the molecular level. Let's now learn more about the genetics of bacteria.





 Genetic recombination produces new bacterial strains

Natural selection depends on heritable variation among the individuals of a population (see Chapter 1). In addition to mutations, genetic recombination generates diversity within bacterial populations. We will define recombination here simply as the combining of DNA from two individuals into the genome of a single individual.

How can we detect genetic recombination in bacteria? Consider two mutant E. coli strains (genetic varieties), each unable to synthesize one of its required amino acids. Wild-type E. coli can grow on a minimal medium containing only glucose, as a source of organic carbon, and salts. The mutant strains cannot grow on this culture medium of minimal nutrients because one of them cannot synthesize tryptophan and the other cannot synthesize arginine (FIGURE 18.12).

Fig 18-12. Detecting genetic recombination in bacteria. Each of the two mutant strains of E. coli in this experiment is unable to synthesize a particular amino acid, either arginine or tryptophan. These mutant bacteria cannot reproduce on minimal medium (MM), which is simply a solution of glucose and salts. But after bacteria of the two mutant strains are incubated together, some cells from the mixed culture are able to grow into colonies on a plate containing minimal medium solidified with agar. Those cells are recombinant bacteria: arg+trp+ cells produced by gene transfer between cells of the two mutant types. (You will learn about the mechanism in FIGURE 18.15c and d.)

Let's suppose we mix bacteria from the two strains together in a liquid medium and allow them to incubate for an hour or so. We then spread a small sample of this culture on solid (agar-thickened) minimal medium in a petri dish and incubate the dish overnight. The next morning we observe numerous colonies of bacteria on the minimal medium. Each of these colonies must have started with a cell capable of making both tryptophan and arginine, but their number far exceeds what can be accounted for by mutation. Most of the cells that can synthesize both amino acids must have acquired one or more genes from the other strain. This is evidence that genetic recombination has occurred.

Bacteria are different from eukaryotes in the ways DNA from two individuals can come together in one cell. In eukaryotes, the sexual processes of meiosis and fertilization combine DNA from two individuals in a single zygote (see Chapter 13). But sex, as defined in eukaryotes, is absent in prokaryotes: Meiosis and fertilization do not occur. Instead, other processes bring together bacterial DNA from different individuals. These processes are transformation, transduction, and conjugation.

Transformation

In the context of bacterial genetics, transformation is the alteration of a bacterial cell's genotype by the uptake of naked, foreign DNA from the surrounding environment. For example, we saw in Chapter 16 that harmless Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria could be transformed to pneumonia-causing cells by the uptake of naked DNA from a medium containing dead, broken-open cells of the pathogenic strain. This transformation occurs when a live nonpathogenic cell takes up a piece of DNA that happens to include the allele for pathogenicity (the gene for a cell coat that protects the bacterium from a host's immune system). The foreign allele is then incorporated into the bacterial chromosome, replacing the native allele (for the "coatless" condition, in this case). The process is genetic recombination--an exchange of DNA segments by crossing over. The cell is now a recombinant: Its chromosome contains DNA derived from two different cells.

For many years after transformation was discovered in laboratory cultures, most biologists believed the process to be too rare and haphazard to play an important role in natural bacterial populations. But researchers have since learned that many bacterial species possess on their surfaces proteins that are specialized for the uptake of naked DNA from the surrounding solution. These proteins specifically recognize and transport only DNA from closely related species of bacteria. Not all bacteria have such membrane proteins. For instance, E. coli does not seem to have any specialized mechanism for the uptake of foreign DNA. However, placing E. coli in a culture medium containing a relatively high concentration of calcium ions will artificially stimulate the cells to take up small pieces of DNA. In biotechnology, this technique is applied to introduce foreign genes into E. coli--genes coding for valuable proteins, such as human insulin and growth hormone.

Transduction

In the DNA transfer process known as transduction, phages (the viruses that infect bacteria) carry bacterial genes from one host cell to another. There are two forms of transduction: generalized transduction and specialized transduction. Both result from aberrations in phage reproductive cycles.

First let's consider generalized transduction, shown on the left side of FIGURE 18.13. Recall that near the end of a phage's lytic cycle, viral nucleic acid molecules are packaged within capsids, and the completed phages are released when the host cell lyses. Occasionally, a small piece of the host cell's degraded DNA is accidentally packaged within a phage capsid in place of the phage genome. Such a virus is defective because it lacks its own genetic material. However, after its release from the lysed host, the phage can attach to another bacterium and inject the piece of bacterial DNA acquired from the first cell. Some of this DNA can subsequently replace the homologous region of the second cell's chromosome. The cell's chromosome now has a combination of DNA derived from two cells; genetic recombination has occurred. This type of transduction is called generalized transduction because the phage transfers bacterial genes at random.

Fig 18-13. Transduction. Phages occasionally carry bacterial genes from one cell to another. In generalized transduction (left), random pieces of the host chromosome are packaged within a phage capsid. In specialized transduction (right), a prophage exits the chromosome in such a way that it carries adjacent bacterial genes along with it. In both types of transduction, the transferred DNA may recombine with the genome of the new host cell.

Let's contrast this process with specialized transduction, shown on the right side of FIGURE 18.13. This form of transduction requires infection by a temperate phage. Recall that in the lysogenic cycle, the genome of a temperate phage integrates as a prophage into the host bacterium's chromosome, usually at a specific site. Later, when the phage genome is excised from the chromosome, it sometimes takes with it a small region of the bacterial DNA that was adjacent to the prophage. When such a virus carrying bacterial DNA infects another host cell, the bacterial genes are injected along with the phage's genome. Specialized transduction transfers only certain genes, those near the prophage site on the bacterial chromosome.

Conjugation and Plasmids

Conjugation is the direct transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells that are temporarily joined. This process, the bacterial version of sex, has been studied most extensively in E. coli. The DNA transfer is one-way: one cell donating DNA, and its "mate" receiving the genes. The DNA donor, referred to informally as the "male," uses appendages called sex pili to attach to the DNA recipient, the "female" (FIGURE 18.14). A sex pilus acts like a grappling hook: After contacting a female cell, it retracts, pulling the two cells together. A temporary cytoplasmic bridge then forms between the two cells, providing an avenue for DNA transfer. In most cases, "maleness," the ability to form sex pili and donate DNA during conjugation, results from the presence of a special piece of DNA called an F factor (F for fertility). An F factor can exist either as a segment of DNA within the bacterial chromosome or as a plasmid. Before discussing the role of the F factor in conjugation, we should examine plasmids more generally.

Fig 18-14. Bacterial mating. The E. coli"male" (right) extends sex pili, one of which is attached to a "female" cell. The two cells will be drawn close together, allowing a cytoplasmic bridge to form between them. Through this tube, the "male" will transfer DNA to the "female." This mechanism of DNA transfer is called conjugation (colorized TEM).

General Characteristics of Plasmids. A plasmid is a small, circular, self-replicating DNA molecule separate from the bacterial chromosome. Certain plasmids, such as F plasmids, can undergo reversible incorporation into the cell's chromosome. A genetic element that can exist either as a plasmid or as part of the bacterial chromosome is called an episome. In addition to some plasmids, temperate viruses, such as phage l, also qualify as episomes. Recall that the genomes of these phages replicate independently during a lytic cycle and as an integral part of the bacterial chromosome during a lysogenic cycle. Of course, there are important differences between plasmids and viruses. Plasmids, unlike viruses, lack protein coats and do not normally exist outside the cell. And plasmids are generally beneficial to the bacterial cell, while viruses are parasites that usually harm their hosts.

A plasmid has only a small number of genes, and these genes are not required for the survival and reproduction of the bacterium under normal conditions. However, the genes of plasmids can confer advantages on bacteria living in stressful environments. For example, the F plasmid facilitates genetic recombination, which may be advantageous in a changing environment that no longer favors existing strains in a bacterial population.

The F Plasmid and Conjugation. The F factor and its plasmid form, the F plasmid, consist of about 25 genes, most required for the production of sex pili. Geneticists use the symbol F+ to denote a cell that contains the F plasmid (a "male" cell). The F+ condition is heritable: The F plasmid replicates in synchrony with the chromosomal DNA, and division of an F+ cell usually gives rise to two offspring that are both F+. Cells lacking the F factor in either form are designated F-, and they function as DNA recipients ("females") during conjugation. The F+ condition is "contagious" in the sense that an F+ cell converts an F- cell to F+ when the two cells conjugate. The original F+ cell remains F+ because the F plasmid replicates within the "male" cell, and only one copy of the plasmid is transferred to the "female" through the conjugation tube joining the cells (FIGURE 18.15a, p. 344). In an F+&#160;X&#160; F- mating, only an F plasmid is transferred.

Fig 18-15. Conjugation and recombination in E. coli. The DNA replication that accompanies transfer of an F plasmid or part of an Hfr bacterial chromosome is called rolling-circle replication.

Under what circumstances are genes of the bacterial chromosome transferred during conjugation? This can occur when the donor cell's F factor is integrated into the chromosome (FIGURE 18.15b). A cell with the F factor built into its chromosome is called an Hfr cell (for high frequency of recombination). Like an F+ cell, an Hfr cell functions as a male during conjugation: It initiates DNA replication at a point on the F factor DNA and from that point starts to transfer the DNA copy to its F- partner. But now, the leading end of the F factor is dragging a copy of chromosomal DNA along with it (FIGURE 18.15c). Random movements of the bacteria almost always disrupt conjugation long before an entire copy of the Hfr chromosome can be passed to the F- cell. Temporarily, the recipient cell is a partial diploid, containing its own chromosome plus DNA copied from part of the donor's chromosome. Then recombination can occur: If part of the newly acquired DNA aligns with the homologous region of the F- chromosome, segments of DNA can be exchanged (FIGURE 18.15d). Binary fission of this cell gives rise to a colony of recombinant bacteria with genes derived from two different cells. (This is what happened in the experiment in FIGURE 18.12, where one of the bacterial strains was an Hfr and the other an F-.)

R Plasmids and Antibiotic Resistance. In the 1950s, Japanese physicians began to notice that some hospital patients suffering from bacterial dysentery, which produces severe diarrhea, did not respond to antibiotics that had generally been effective in treating this type of infection. Apparently, re-sis-tance to these antibiotics had evolved in certain strains of Shigella, the pathogen. Eventually, researchers began to identify the specific genes that confer antibiotic resistance in Shigella and other pathogenic bacteria. Some of these genes, for example, code for enzymes that specifically destroy certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline or ampicillin. The genes conferring resistance, it turns out, are carried by plasmids, now known as R plasmids (R for resistance).

Exposure of a bacterial population to a specific antibiotic, whether in a laboratory culture or within a host organism, will kill antibiotic-sensitive bacteria but not those that happen to have R plasmids that counter that antibiotic. The theory of natural selection predicts that under these circumstances, the fraction of the bacterial population carrying genes for anti-biotic resistance will increase, and that is exactly what happens. The medical consequences are also predictable: Resistant strains of pathogens are becoming more common, making the treatment of certain bacterial infections more difficult. The problem is compounded by the fact that R plasmids, like F plasmids, have genes that encode sex pili and enable plasmid transfer from one bacterial cell to another by conjugation. Making the problem still worse, some R plasmids carry as many as ten genes for resistance to that many antibiotics. How do so many antibiotic resistance genes become part of a single plasmid? The answer involves another type of mobile genetic element, called a transposon, which we investigate next.

Transposons

A transposon, also called a transposable genetic element, is a piece of DNA that can move from one location to another in a cell's genome. Unlike an episome or prophage, transposons never exist independently. Instead, transposon movement (transposition) occurs as a type of recombination between the transposon and another DNA site--a target site--that comes in contact with the transposon. In a bacterial cell, a transposon may move within the chromosome, from a plasmid to the chromosome (or vice versa), or from one plasmid to another. Transposons bring multiple genes for antibiotic resistance into a single R plasmid by moving the genes to that location from different plasmids.

Transposons are sometimes called "jumping genes," but the phrase is slightly misleading. Some transposons do jump from one genomic location to another, in what is called cut-and-paste transposition. However, in another type of transposition, called replicative transposition, the transposon replicates at its original site, and a copy inserts elsewhere; that is, the transposon is added at some new site without being lost from the old site.

Although transposons vary in their selectivity for target sites, most can move to many alternative locations in the DNA. This ability to scatter certain genes throughout the genome makes transposition fundamentally different from other mechanisms of genetic shuffling. The genetic recombination that occurs in bacterial transformation, generalized transduction, and conjugation (and during meiosis in eukaryotes as well) depends on base pairing between homologous regions of DNA, regions of identical or very similar base sequence. In contrast, the insertion of a transposon in a new site does not depend on complementary base sequences. A transposon can move genes to a site where genes of that sort have never before existed.

Insertion Sequences. The simplest bacterial transposons are insertion sequences. They consist of only the DNA necessary for the act of transposition. The one gene found in an insertion sequence codes for a transposase, an enzyme that catalyzes movement of the transposon from one location to another within the genome. The transposase gene is bracketed by a pair of DNA sequences called inverted repeats, noncoding sequences about 20 to 40 nucleotides long. Notice in FIGURE 18.16 that each base sequence is repeated in reverse along the opposite DNA strand of the inverted repeat at the other end of the transposon. Transposase recognizes these inverted repeats as the boundaries of the transposon. During transposition, molecules of the enzyme bind to the inverted repeats and to a target site elsewhere in the genome and catalyze the DNA cutting and resealing required for transposition. Other enzymes also participate in transposition. For example, DNA polymerase helps create identical regions of DNA, called direct repeats, that flank a transposon in its new site (FIGURE 18.17, p. 346).

Fig 18-16. Insertion sequences, the simplest transposons. The one gene of an insertion sequence codes for transposase, which catalyzes the transposon's movement. The inverted repeats, about 20 to 40 nucleotide pairs long, are backward, upside-down versions of each other. In transposition, transposase molecules bind to the inverted repeats and catalyze the cutting and resealing of DNA required for insertion of the transposon at a target site. This diagram and the ones that follow are not to scale.

Fig 18-17. Insertion of a transposon and creation of direct repeats. 
			  
		 First, the transposase enzyme makes staggered cuts (red arrows) in the two DNA strands at a target site, leaving short segments of unpaired DNA as shown. Meanwhile, the transposon is cut out or copied at its initial site. 
			  
		 The transposon is then joined to the single-stranded ends at the target site. Presumably, the transposase holds all the components together during this process. 
			  
		 Finally, the gaps in the DNA strands are filled in by DNA polymerase and sealed by ligase. This results in direct repeats, identical segments of DNA on either side of the transposon. (Distances along the DNA are not to scale).

Insertion sequences cause mutations when they happen to land within the coding sequence of a gene or within a DNA region that regulates gene expression. But notice that this mechanism of mutation is intrinsic to the cell, in contrast to mutagenesis by extrinsic factors such as environmental radiation and chemicals. Insertion sequences account for about 1.5%  of the E. coli genome. However, mutation of a given gene by transposition occurs only rarely--about once in every 10 million generations. This is about the same as the spontaneous mutation rate due to other factors.

Composite Transposons. Transposons longer and more complex than insertion sequences also move about in the bacterial genome. In addition to the DNA required for transposition, these composite transposons (also called complex transposons) include extra genes that go along for the ride, such as genes for antibiotic resistance. The extra genes are sandwiched between two insertion sequences (FIGURE 18.18). It is as though two insertion sequences happened to land relatively close together in the genome and now travel together, along with all the DNA between them, as a single transposon. As is characteristic of transposons, there is an inverted repeat and a direct repeat at each end. (The direct repeat is not considered part of the transposon, however.)

Fig 18-18. Anatomy of a composite transposon. A composite transposon consists of one or more genes located between twin insertion sequences. The transposon here has a gene for resistance to an antibiotic, which is carried along as part of the transposon when the transposon is inserted at a new site in the genome.

In contrast to insertion sequences, which are not known to benefit bacteria in any specific way, composite transposons may help bacteria adapt to new environments. We mentioned earlier that a single R plasmid can carry several genes for resistance to different antibiotics. This is explained by composite transposons, which can add a gene for antibiotic resistance to a plasmid already carrying genes for resistance to other antibiotics. The transmission of this composite plasmid to other bacterial cells by cell division or conjugation can then spread resistance to a variety of antibiotics throughout a bacterial population. In an antibiotic-rich environment, natural selection favors bacterial clones that have built up composite R plasmids through a series of transpositions.

Transposable genetic elements are not unique to bacteria, but are important components of eukaryotic genomes as well. In fact, the first evidence for such wandering DNA segments came from the American geneticist Barbara McClintock's breeding experiments with Indian corn (maize) in the 1940s and 1950s. McClintock identified changes in the color of corn kernels that made sense only if she postulated the existence of mobile genetic elements capable of moving from other locations in the genome to the genes for kernel color. She called these mobile elements "controlling -elements" because they seemed to insert next to the genes responsible for kernel color, either activating or inactivating those genes. McClintock's discovery received little attention until transposons were discovered in bacteria many years later and microbial geneticists learned more about the molecular basis of transposition. In 1983, more than 30 years after she discovered transposable genetic elements, Barbara McClintock was awarded a Nobel Prize, at age 81. McClintock continued her experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York until her death in 1992.

You will learn more about transposons in eukaryotes in Chapter 19. We end this Chapter by examining how bacterial genes are regulated in different environments.





 The control of gene expression enables individual bacteria to adjust their metabolism to environmental change

Mutations and the various types of genetic transfer we have been studying generate the genetic variation that makes natural selection possible. And natural selection, acting over many generations, can increase the proportion of individuals in a bacterial population that are adapted to some new environmental condition. But how can an individual bacterium, locked into the genome it has inherited, cope with environmental fluctuation?

Think, for instance, of an E. coli cell living in the erratic environment of a human colon, dependent for its nutrients on the whimsical eating habits of its host. If the bacterium is deprived of the amino acid tryptophan, which it needs to survive, it responds by activating a metabolic pathway to make its own tryptophan from another compound. Later, if the human host eats a tryptophan-rich meal, the bacterial cell stops producing tryptophan for itself, thus saving the cell from squandering its resources to produce a substance that is available from the surrounding solution in prefabricated form. This is just one example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to changing environments.

Metabolic control occurs on two levels (FIGURE 18.19). First, cells can vary the numbers of specific enzyme molecules made; that is, they can regulate the expression of genes. Second, cells can adjust the activity of enzymes already present. The latter mode of control, which is more immediate, depends on the sensitivity of many enzymes to chemical cues that increase or decrease their catalytic activity (see Chapter 6). For example, activity of the first enzyme of the tryptophan synthesis pathway is inhibited by the pathway's end product. Thus, if tryptophan accumulates in a cell, it shuts down its own synthesis. Such feedback inhibition, typical of anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways, allows a cell to adapt to short-term fluctuations in levels of a substance it needs.

Fig 18-19. Regulation of a metabolic pathway. In the pathway for tryptophan synthesis, an abundance of tryptophan can both (a) repress expression of the genes for all the enzymes needed for the pathway, and (b) inhibit the activity of the first enzyme in the pathway (feedback inhibition). The symbol  stands for "inhibition."

If, in our example, the environment continues to provide all the tryptophan the cell needs, the regulation of gene expression also comes into play: The cell stops making enzymes of the tryptophan pathway. This control of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcription, the synthesis of messenger RNA coding for these enzymes. More generally, many genes of the bacterial genome are switched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the cell. The basic mechanism for this control of gene expression in bacteria, described as the operon model, was discovered in 1961 by Franois Jacob and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Let's see what an operon is and how it works, using the control of tryptophan synthesis as our first example.

Operons: The Basic Concept

E. coli synthesizes tryptophan from a precursor molecule in a series of steps, each reaction catalyzed by a specific enzyme (see FIGURE 18.19). The five genes coding for the polypeptide chains that make up these enzymes are clustered together on the bacterial chromosome. A single promoter serves all five genes, which constitute a transcription unit. (Recall from Chapter 17 that a promoter is a site where RNA polymerase can bind to DNA and begin transcribing genes.) Thus, transcription gives rise to one long mRNA molecule representing all five genes for the tryptophan pathway. The cell can translate this transcript into separate polypeptides because the mRNA is punctuated with start and stop codons signaling where the coding sequence for each polypeptide begins and ends.

A key advantage of grouping genes of related function into one transcription unit is that a single "on-off switch" can control the whole cluster of functionally related genes. When an E. coli cell must make tryptophan for itself because the nutrient medium lacks this amino acid, all the enzymes for the metabolic pathway are synthesized at one time. The switch is a segment of DNA called an operator. Both its location and name suit its function: Positioned within the promoter or between the promoter and the enzyme-coding genes, the operator controls the access of RNA polymerase to the genes. All together, the operator, the promoter, and the genes they control--the entire stretch of DNA required for enzyme production for the tryptophan pathway--is called an operon (FIGURE 18.20). Here we are dissecting one of many operons that have been discovered in E. coli: the trp operon (trp for tryptophan).

Fig 18-20. The trp operon: regulated synthesis of repressible enzymes. Tryptophan is an amino acid produced by an anabolic path-way catalyzed by repressible enzymes. Five genes encoding the polypeptides that make up the enzymes of this pathway are grouped into an operon, along with a promoter and an operator. (The trp operator is located within the trp promoter.) Accumulation of tryptophan, the end product of the pathway, represses synthesis of the enzymes. The mechanism in E. coli is shown here.

If the operator is the control point for transcription, what determines whether the operator is in the on or off mode? By itself, the operator is on; RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes of the operon. The operon can be switched off by a protein called the repressor. The repressor binds to the operator and blocks attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, preventing transcription of the genes. Repressor proteins are specific; that is, they recognize and bind only to the operator of a certain operon. The repressor that switches off the trp operon has no effect on other operons in the E. coli genome.

The repressor is the product of a gene called a regulatory gene. The regulatory gene encoding the trp repressor, trpR, is located some distance away from the operon it controls and has its own promoter. Transcription of trpR produces an mRNA molecule that is translated into the repressor protein, which can then reach the operator of the trp operon by diffusion. Regulatory genes are transcribed continuously, although at a low rate, and a few trp repressor molecules are always present in the cell. Why, then, is the trp operon not switched off permanently? First, the binding of repressors to operators is reversible. An operator vacillates between the on and off modes, with the relative duration of each state depending on the number of active repressor molecules around. Secondly, the trp repressor, like most regulatory proteins, is an allosteric protein, with two alternative shapes, active and inactive (see FIGURE 6.18). The trp repressor is synthesized in an inactive form with little affinity for the trp operator. Only if tryptophan binds to the repressor at an allosteric site does the repressor protein change to the active form that can attach to the operator, turning the operon off.

Tryptophan functions in this system as a corepressor, a small molecule that cooperates with a repressor protein to switch an operon off. As tryptophan accumulates, more tryptophan molecules associate with trp repressor molecules, which can then bind to the trp operator and shut down tryptophan production. If the cell's tryptophan level drops, transcription of the operon's genes resumes. This is one example of how gene expression responds rapidly to changes in the cell's internal and external environment.

Repressible Versus Inducible Operons: Two Types of Negative Gene Regulation

The trp operon is said to be a repressible operon because its transcription is inhibited when a specific small molecule (tryptophan) binds allosterically to a regulatory protein. In contrast, an inducible operon is stimulated (that is, induced) when a specific small molecule interacts with a regulatory protein. Let's investigate an example, which was actually the operon first worked out by Jacob and Monod (FIGURE 18.21).

Fig 18-21. The lac operon: regulated synthesis of inducible enzymes. E. coli uses three enzymes to take up and metabolize lactose. The genes for these three enzymes are clustered in the lac operon. One gene, lacZ, codes for b-galactosidase, which hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose. The second gene, lacY, codes for a permease, the membrane protein that transports lactose into the cell. The third gene, lacA, codes for an enzyme called transacetylase, whose function in lactose metabolism is still unclear. The gene for the lac repressor, lacI, happens to be adjacent to the lac operon, an unusual situation. (The function of the upstream (left) end of the promoter is revealed in FIGURE 18.22.)

The disaccharide lactose (milk sugar) is available to E. coli if the human host drinks milk. The bacteria can absorb the lactose and break it down for energy or use it as a source of organic carbon for synthesizing other compounds. Lactose metabolism begins with hydrolysis of the disaccharide into its two component monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is called b-galactosidase. Only a few molecules of this enzyme are present in an E. coli cell that has been growing in the absence of lactose--in the intestines of a person who does not drink milk, for example. But if lactose is added to the bacterium's nutrient medium, it takes only about 15 minutes for the number of b-galactosidase molecules in the cell to increase a thousandfold.

The gene for b-galactosidase is part of an operon, the lac operon (lac for lactose metabolism), that includes two other genes coding for proteins that function in lactose metabolism (see FIGURE 18.21). This entire transcription unit is under the command of a single operator and promoter. The regulatory gene, lacI, located outside the operon, codes for an allosteric repressor protein that can switch off the lac operon by binding to the operator. So far, this sounds just like regulation of the trp operon, but there is one important difference. Recall that the trp repressor was innately inactive and required tryptophan as a corepressor in order to bind to the operator. The lac repressor, in contrast, is active all by itself, binding to the operator and switching the lac operon off. In this case, a specific small molecule, called an inducer, inactivates the repressor. For the lac operon, the inducer is allolactose, an isomer of lactose formed in small amounts from lactose that enters the cell. In the absence of lactose (and hence allolactose), the lac repressor is in its active configuration, and the genes of the lac operon are silenced. If lactose is added to the cell's nutrient medium, allolactose binds to the lac repressor and alters its conformation, nullifying the repressor's ability to attach to the operator. Now, on demand, the lac operon produces mRNA for the enzymes of the lactose pathway. In the context of gene regulation, these enzymes are referred to as inducible enzymes, because their synthesis is induced by a chemical signal (allolactose, in this case). Analogously, the enzymes for tryptophan synthesis are said to be repressible.

Let's compare repressible enzymes and inducible enzymes in terms of the metabolic economy of the E. coli cell. Repressible enzymes generally function in anabolic pathways, which synthesize essential end products from raw materials (precursors). By suspending production of an end product when it is already present in sufficient quantity, the cell can allocate its organic precursors and energy for other uses. In contrast, inducible enzymes usually function in catabolic pathways, which break a nutrient down to simpler molecules. By producing the appropriate enzymes only when the nutrient is available, the cell avoids making proteins that have nothing to do. Why bother, for example, to make the enzymes that break down milk sugar when no milk is present?

In comparing repressible and inducible enzymes, there is one more important point: Both systems are examples of the negative control of genes, because the operons are switched off by the active form of the repressor protein. It may be easier to see this in the case of the trp operon, but it is true for the lac operon as well. Allolactose induces enzyme synthesis not by acting directly on the genome, but by freeing the lac operon from the negative effect of the repressor. Technically, allolactose is more of a derepressor than an inducer of genes. Gene regulation is said to be positive only when an activator molecule interacts directly with the genome to switch transcription on. Let's look at an example, again involving the lac operon.

An Example of Positive Gene Regulation

For the enzymes that break down lactose to be synthesized in appreciable quantity, it is not enough that lactose be present in the bacterial cell. The other requirement is that the simple sugar glucose be in short supply. Given a choice of substrates for glycolysis and other catabolic pathways, E. coli preferentially uses glucose, the sugar most reliably present in its environment. The enzymes for glucose breakdown (glycolysis; see FIGURE 9.9) are continually present.

How does the E. coli cell sense the glucose concentration, and how is this information relayed to the genome? Again, the mechanism depends on the interaction of an allosteric regulatory protein with a small organic molecule. The small molecule is cyclic AMP (cAMP), which accumulates when glucose is scarce (see FIGURE 11.12 for the structure of cAMP). The regulatory protein is cAMP receptor protein (CRP), and it is an activator of transcription. When cAMP binds to the allosteric site on CRP, the protein assumes its active shape and can bind to a specific site at the upstream end of the lac promoter (FIGURE 18.22). The attachment of CRP actually bends the DNA, which somehow makes it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and start transcription of the operon. Because CRP is a regulatory protein that directly stimulates gene expression, this mechanism qualifies as positive regulation.

Fig 18-22. Positive control: cAMP receptor protein. RNA polymerase has a low affinity for the promoter of the lac operon unless helped by a regulatory protein called the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which binds to a DNA site at the upstream end of the promoter. The CRP molecule can attach to the DNA only when associated with cyclic AMP (cAMP), whose concentration in the cell rises when the glucose concentration falls. Thus, even if lactose is available, the cell preferentially catabolizes glucose, using enzymes that are always present. This regulatory system ensures that E. coli will gear up for consumption of lactose and other secondary catabolites only when glucose is scarce.

If the amount of glucose in the cell increases, the cAMP concentration falls, and without it, CRP disengages from the operon. Because CRP is inactive, transcription of the lac operon proceeds at only a low level, even in the presence of lactose. Thus, the lac operon is under dual control: negative control by the lac repressor and positive control by CRP. The state of the lac repressor (with or without allolactose) determines whether or not transcription of the lac operon's genes can occur; the state of CRP (with or without cAMP) controls the rate of transcription if the operon is repressor-free. It is as though the operon has both an on-off switch and a volume control.

Although we have used the lac operon as an example, CRP, unlike repressor proteins, works on several different operons that encode enzymes used in catabolic pathways. When glucose is present and CRP is inactive, there is a general slowdown in the synthesis of enzymes required for the catabolism of compounds other than glucose. The cell's ability to catabolize other compounds, such as lactose, provides backup systems that enable a cell deprived of glucose to survive. The specific compounds present at the moment determine which operons are switched on. These elaborate contingency mechanisms suit an organism that cannot control what its host eats. Bacteria are remarkable in their ability to adapt--over the long term by evolutionary changes in their genetic makeup and over the short term by the control of gene expression in individual cells. Of course, the various control mechanisms are also evolutionary products that exist because they have been favored by natural selection.

Molecular genetics was founded on the study of viruses and bacteria, the microbial models that have been the subjects of this chapter. Eukaryotic organisms and their genomes are much more complex, and only in the past decade or so have researchers begun to learn how the control of gene expression helps bring about this complexity. In the next chapter, we begin to explore this topic.

Eukaryotic cells face the same challenges as prokaryotic cells in expressing their genes, but with two main differences: the much greater size of the typical eukaryotic genome and the importance of cell specialization in multicellular eukaryotes. These two complications present a formidable information-processing task for the eukaryotic cell.

Consider the genome of a human cell. It has an estimated 35,000 genes--more than ten times that of a typical bacterium. It also includes an enormous amount of DNA that does not program the synthesis of RNA or protein. The entire mass of DNA must be precisely replicated with each turn of the cell cycle. Managing so much DNA requires that it be elaborately organized. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, DNA associates with proteins to form chromatin, but in the eukaryotic cell, the chromatin is ordered into higher structural levels. The light micrograph above gives a sense of the complex organization of chromatin in a developing salamander ovum. Part of the chromatin (white) is packed into the main axis of each of the chromosome's two chromatids, while other parts (red loops) are being actively transcribed. As in prokaryotes, transcription is the stage at which eukaryotic gene expression is most often regulated. In this chapter, you will learn more about the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes, the organization of nucleotide sequences in eukaryotic genomes, and the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene control. You will also learn about DNA changes that disrupt gene regulation and lead to cancer.





EUKARYOTIC CHROMATIN STRUCTURE

 

 Chromatin structure is based on successive levels of DNA packing



Let's start by looking at how eukaryotic cells pack their chromosomal DNA into chromatin.

 Gene amplification, loss, or rearrangement can alter a cell's genome during an organism's lifetime



Now we are ready to examine how genes and other DNA sequences are organized within the genome. Because most of this unit has focused on genes, you may be surprised to learn that genes make up only a tiny portion of the genomes of most multicellular eukaryotes.

The rearrangement of antibody genes and other processes that alter DNA sequences in somatic cells are bona fide mechanisms for regulating gene expression. They are limited, however, to particular genes in certain cells. We now examine the more general mechanisms of gene control that are used to regulate most eukaryotic genes.





THE MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER

 

 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect the cell cycle



 

 Oncogene proteins and faulty tumor-suppressor proteins interfere with normal signaling pathways



 

 Multiple mutations underlie the development of cancer



In Chapter 12, we considered cancer as a set of diseases in which cells escape from the control mechanisms normally limiting their growth. Now that we have discussed the molecular basis of gene expression and its regulation, we are ready to look at cancer more closely.





 Chromatin structure is based on successive levels of DNA packing

Even bacterial DNA has packing. Typically containing only several million nucleotide pairs, the bacterial genome was once thought to be a naked circle of DNA without any particular folding pattern. Now we know that the DNA of the bacterial chromosome is associated with specific proteins and that it is coiled and looped in a complex but orderly manner.

Nevertheless, eukaryotic chromatin (FIGURE 19.1) is considerably more complex than bacterial chromatin. Eukaryotic DNA is precisely combined with a large amount of protein, and the resulting chromatin undergoes striking changes in the course of the cell cycle. During interphase, chromatin fibers are usually highly extended within the nucleus. When interphase cells are stained for light microscopy, the chromatin appears as a diffuse, colored mass. As you learned in Chapter 12, however, when a cell prepares for mitosis, its chromatin coils and folds up (condenses) to form a characteristic number of short, thick chromosomes that are distinguishable with the light microscope.

Fig 19-1. Levels of chromatin packing. This series of diagrams and transmission electron micrographs depicts a current model for the progressive stages of DNA coiling and folding that culminate in a highly condensed metaphase chromosome.

Eukaryotic chromosomes contain an enormous amount of DNA relative to their condensed length. Each chromosome contains a single linear DNA double helix that, in humans, averages about 2 &#160;X&#160; 108 nucleotide pairs. If extended, such a DNA molecule would be about 6 cm long, thousands of times longer than the diameter of a cell nucleus. All this DNA--as well as the DNA of the other 45 human chromosomes--fits into the nucleus through an elaborate, multilevel system of DNA packing. FIGURE 19.1 (preceding page) shows a model for this packing.

Nucleosomes, or "Beads on a String"

Proteins called histones are responsible for the first level of DNA packing in eukaryotic chromatin. In fact, the mass of histone in chromatin is approximately equal to the mass of DNA. Histones have a high proportion of positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine), and they bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA. (Recall that the phosphate groups of DNA give it a negative charge all along its length; see FIGURE 16.5.) The DNA-histone complex is chromatin in its most fundamental form. There are five types of histone. Histones are very similar from one eukaryote to another, and similar proteins are found even in bacteria. Apparently, the histone genes have been highly conserved during evolution.

In electron micrographs, unfolded chromatin has the appearance of beads on a string, as shown in FIGURE 19.1a. Each "bead" and its adjacent DNA form a nucleosome, the basic unit of DNA packing. The nucleosome bead consists of DNA wound around a protein core composed of two molecules each of four different types of histone: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. A molecule of the fifth histone, called H1, attaches to the DNA near the bead when the chromatin undergoes the next level of packing.

The beaded string seems to remain essentially intact throughout the cell cycle. The histones leave the DNA only transiently during DNA replication, and they stay with the DNA during transcription. How can DNA be transcribed when it is wrapped around histones in nucleosomes? Researchers have learned that nucleosomes are dynamic structures. By changing shape and position, they can allow RNA-synthesizing polymerases to move along the DNA. Later in this chapter, we'll discuss some recent discoveries about the roles of nucleosomes in the regulation of gene expression.

Higher Levels of DNA Packing

The beaded string undergoes higher-order packing. This is clearest when the extended interphase chromatin condenses to produce the thickened, compact chromosomes we see during mitosis. In the laboratory, mitotic chromosomes can be isolated and unraveled to reveal several orders of chromatin coiling. FIGURE 19.1b-d illustrates the various structures in order of increasing compactness. With the aid of histone H1, the beaded string coils or folds to form a fiber roughly 30 nm in thickness, known as the 30-nm chromatin fiber (FIGURE 19.1b). The 30-nm fiber, in turn, forms loops called looped domains, which are attached to a chromosome scaffold made of nonhistone proteins. In a mitotic chromosome, the looped domains themselves coil and fold, further compacting all the chromatin to produce the characteristic metaphase chromosome you see in the micrograph at the bottom of FIGURE 19.1. We know that the packing steps are highly specific and precise, for particular genes always end up located at the same places in metaphase chromosomes.

Though interphase chromatin is generally much less condensed than the chromatin of mitotic chromosomes, it shows several of these same levels of higher-order packing. Much of the beaded string is compacted into a 30-nm fiber and then further folded into looped domains (as in the micrograph opening this chapter). Although an interphase chromosome lacks a discrete "scaffold," its looped domains seem to be attached to the nuclear lamina, on the inside of the nuclear envelope, and perhaps also to fibers of the nuclear matrix. These attachments may help organize regions of active transcription. The chromatin of each chromosome occupies a restricted area within the interphase nucleus, and the chromatin fibers of different chromosomes do not become entangled.

Even during interphase, portions of certain chromosomes in some cells exist in the highly condensed state represented in FIGURE 19.1d. This type of interphase chromatin, which is visible with a light microscope, is called heterochromatin, to distinguish it from the less compacted euchromatin ("true chromatin"). What is the function of this selective condensation in interphase cells? The formation of heterochromatin may be a sort of coarse adjustment in the control of gene expression, for heterochromatin DNA is not transcribed.





 Repetitive DNA and other noncoding sequences account for much of a eukaryotic genome

In prokaryotes, most of the DNA in a genome codes for protein (or tRNA and rRNA), with the small amount of noncoding DNA consisting mainly of regulatory sequences, such as promoters. The coding sequence of nucleotides along a prokaryotic gene proceeds from start to finish without interruption. In eukaryotic genomes, by contrast, most of the DNA--about 97%  in humans--does not encode protein or RNA. What does this DNA consist of? Some of it is known to be regulatory sequences, but much of it consists of sequences whose functions, if any, are not yet understood. This DNA includes introns, the stretches of noncoding DNA that often interrupt the coding sequences of eukaryotic genes (see FIGURE 17.9). Even more of the noncoding DNA consists of repetitive DNA, nucleotide sequences that are present in many copies in a genome, usually not within genes.

Tandemly Repetitive DNA

TABLE 19.1 lists the main categories of repetitive DNA, which occur in different amounts in different species. In mammals, about 10-15%  of the genome is tandemly repetitive DNA, short sequences repeated in series, as in the following example (showing one DNA strand only):&#160;...&#160; GTTACGTTACGTTACGTTACGTTACGTTAC&#160;...&#160; The number of repetitions of the GTTAC unit at a site in the genome could be as high as several hundred thousand. Repeated units are up to ten base pairs long.

Table 19-1. Types of Repetitive DNA

Tandemly Repetitive DNA (Satellite DNA)Repeated units at a site are usually identicalProportion of mammalian DNA:10-15% Length of each repeated unit:1-10 base pairsTotal length of repetitive DNA per site, in base pairs:Regular satellite DNA100,000-10 millionMinisatellite DNA100-100,000Microsatellite DNA10-100Interspersed Repetitive DNA"Copies" are very similar but not identicalProportion of mammalian DNA:25-40% Length of each repeated unit:100-10,000 base pairsNumber of repetitions per genome:10-1 millionThe nucleotide composition of tandemly repetitive DNA is often different enough from the rest of the cell's DNA to give the repetitive DNA an intrinsically different density, enabling researchers to isolate it by differential ultracentrifugation (as in the Meselson-Stahl experiment; see FIGURE 16.9). If the genomic DNA is cut into pieces before centrifugation, segments of different density migrate to different positions in the centrifuge tube. Repetitive DNA isolated in this way was originally called satellite DNA, because it appeared as a "satellite" band in the centrifuge tube, separate from the rest of the DNA. Now the term is often used for all tandemly repetitive DNA.

As TABLE 19.1 shows, satellite DNA is classified into three types, depending on the total length of the DNA at each site. Regular satellite DNA occurs in stretches over 100,000 base pairs long, while minisatellite and microsatellite subcategories have been created for sequences that appear in shorter stretches. Microsatellite DNA, with short units repeated only 10 to 100 times, has turned out to be extremely useful for DNA fingerprinting, as we'll discuss in Chapter 20.

A number of genetic disorders, including two you read about in Chapter 15, are caused by abnormally long stretches of tandemly repeated nucleotide triplets--a sort of microsatellite--within the affected gene. The first such "triplet repeat" sequence to be identified was the one responsible for fragile X syndrome, a major cause of mental retardation. In the normal allele for the fragile X gene, within the 5&#39; untranslated leader region of the first exon, the triplet CGG is repeated about 30 times; in a fragile X allele, the same triplet is repeated hundreds or even thousands of times, creating the fragile site. The lengthening of the repetitive DNA occurs in steps over a number of generations. Huntington's disease is also a triplet-repeat disorder, with a stretch of repeated CAG triplets that lengthens in a similar fashion. In this case, the triplet repeat is actually translated, and the resulting protein has a long string of glutamines, the amino acid encoded in DNA by CAG (recall that DNA sequences are given as they appear on the nontemplate strand). The dozen triplet-repeat disorders identified to date all affect the nervous system, and in all cases the number of repeats seems to correlate with the severity of the disease and the age of onset. Scientists do not yet know exactly how the extra repeats cause disorders; the mechanism undoubtedly varies with the gene.

Much of a genome's regular satellite DNA is located at chromosomal telomeres and centromeres, suggesting that this DNA plays a structural role for chromosomes. The DNA at centromeres is essential for the separation of chromatids in cell division (see Chapter 12), and along with other tandemly repetitive sequences, it may help organize the chromatin within the interphase nucleus. We discussed the DNA of telomeres, the tips of chromosomes, in Chapter 16. Besides protecting genes from being lost as the DNA shortens with each round of replication, telomeric DNA protects the chromosome by binding proteins that protect the ends from degradation and from joining to other chromosomes.

The importance of telomeres and centromeres has been highlighted by the creation of artificial chromosomes in the laboratory. The DNA used to make such chromosomes must, of course, include an origin of replication. But this is not sufficient; to function as a chromosome, it must also have a centromere and two telomeres. If an artificial chromosome has these features--no matter what the nature of its other DNA--a cell will be able to replicate it and distribute the copies properly to daughter cells.

Interspersed Repetitive DNA

In addition to tandemly repetitive DNA, eukaryotic genomes have huge amounts of interspersed repetitive DNA (see TABLE 19.1). The repeated units of this type of DNA are not next to each other; instead, they are scattered about the genome. A single unit is usually hundreds or even thousands of base pairs long, and the dispersed "copies" are similar but usually not identical to each other. Interspersed repetitive DNA makes up 25-40%  of most mammalian genomes. In humans and other primates, a large portion of this DNA (at least 5%  of the genome) consists of a family of similar sequences called Alu elements, for which each unit is about 300 nucleotide pairs long. Like the Huntington's disease triplet repeats, Alu elements are an exception to the notion that repetitive DNA is noncoding. Many Alu elements are transcribed into RNA molecules; their cellular function, if any, is unknown.

Although we know little about the functions of interspersed repetitive DNA, we do know how it comes to be both abundant and variable in location. Most such sequences, at least in mammals, seem to be transposons, the mobile genetic elements introduced in Chapter 18. We'll have more to say about eukaryotic transposons later in this chapter.





 Gene families have evolved by duplication of ancestral genes

As in prokaryotes, most eukaryotic genes are present as unique sequences, with only one copy per haploid set of chromosomes. However, some genes are present in more than one copy, and others closely resemble each other in nucleotide sequence. A collection of identical or very similar genes is called a multigene family. It is likely that the members of each family evolved from a single ancestral gene. Multigene families can be thought of as repetitive DNA with very long (gene-length) repeating units. The members of a multigene family may be clustered or dispersed in the genome.

Some multigene families consist of identical genes, usually clustered tandemly. Although the genes for histone proteins are a notable exception, multigene families of identical genes usually consist of genes for RNA products. An example is the family of identical genes for the three largest ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules (FIGURE 19.2). These rRNA molecules are encoded in a single transcription unit that is repeated tandemly hundreds to thousands of times in the genome of a multicellular eukaryote. The many copies enable cells to make the millions of ribosomes needed for active protein synthesis. The primary transcript is cleaved to yield the three rRNA molecules. These are then combined with proteins and one other kind of rRNA to form ribosomal subunits.

Fig 19-2. Part of a family of identical genes for ribosomal RNA.

The classic examples of multigene families of nonidentical genes are the two related families of genes that encode globins, the a and b polypeptide subunits of hemoglobin. One family, located on chromosome 16 in humans, encodes various versions of a-globin; the other, on chromosome 11, encodes versions of b-globin (FIGURE 19.3). Similarities in the sequences of the various globin genes indicate that the a-like globins and b-like globins all evolved from one common ancestral globin. The different versions of each globin subunit are expressed at different times in development, allowing hemoglobin to function effectively in the changing environment of the developing animal. In humans, for example, the embryonic and fetal forms of hemoglobin have a higher affinity for oxygen than the adult forms, ensuring the efficient transfer of oxygen from mother to developing fetus.

Fig 19-3. The evolution of human a-globin and b-globin gene families. The two kinds of polypeptides that make up hemoglobin are encoded by genes belonging to two gene families, which are found as clusters on two different chromosomes. Each family consists of a group of very similar, but not identical, genes. Noncoding DNA separates the functional genes within each family cluster, including pseudogenes (green). Shown here is a hypothesis for the evolution of the modern a- and b-globin gene families from a single ancestral globin gene.

How do families of genes arise from a single gene? The most likely explanation is that they arise by repeated gene duplication, which can result from errors during DNA replication and recombination. The differences among the genes in families of nonidentical genes probably arise from mutations that accumulate in the gene copies over many generations. The existence of DNA segments called pseudogenes is evidence for this process of gene duplication and mutation. Pseudogenes have sequences very similar to real genes but do not yield functional products. Presumably, over evolutionary time, random mutations have destroyed their function. The globin gene families include several pseudogenes within the stretches of noncoding DNA between the functional genes.

The location of the a-globin and b-globin families on different human chromosomes, as well as the dispersion of the genes of certain other gene families, probably arose by transposition, one of the topics in the next section.





 Gene amplification, loss, or rearrangement can alter a cell's genome during an organism's lifetime

We are used to the idea that, except for rare mutations, the nucleotide sequence of an organism's DNA is constant during its lifetime. However, there are a few important exceptions in which the DNA of somatic cells is altered in a systematic way. Because these changes do not affect gametes, they are not passed on to offspring, but they can and do have major effects on gene expression within particular cells and tissues.

Gene Amplification and Selective Gene Loss

Sometimes the number of copies of a gene or gene family temporarily increases in the cells of some tissues during a particular stage of development. For instance, consider the genes for ribosomal RNA in amphibians. As in most eukaryotes, multiple copies of these genes are built into the genome of every cell (the result of gene duplication in the evolutionary past). A developing ovum, however, synthesizes a million or more additional copies of the rRNA genes, which exist in nucleoli as tiny DNA circles separate from the chromosomes. This selective replication of certain genes, called gene amplification, is a potent way of increasing expression of the rRNA genes, enabling the developing egg cell to make enormous numbers of ribosomes. These ribosomes make possible a burst of protein synthesis once the egg is fertilized. The extra copies of the rRNA genes cannot replicate further and are broken down during early embryonic development.

Gene amplification has also been observed in cancer cells exposed to high concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs. While such drugs may kill a great many cells in a tumor, invariably some cells are resistant. These cells often contain amplified segments of DNA carrying genes conferring drug resistance. In the laboratory, increasing the concentration of such drugs leads to increasing resistance in the cell population by selecting for cells that have amplified these genes.

In certain insects, genes are selectively lost in certain tissues (although not in the cells that give rise to gametes, of course). In fact, whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes may be eliminated from certain cells early in insect development.

Rearrangements in the Genome

More common than gene amplification or loss is the shuffling of substantial stretches of DNA. Here we are talking not about the genetic recombination that goes on in meiosis but about rearrangements that change the loci of genes in somatic cells of an organism. Such rearrangements may have powerful effects on gene expression.

Transposons and Retrotransposons. All organisms seem to have transposons, stretches of DNA that can move from one location to another within the genome. Transposons were discussed in detail in FIGURES 18.16-18.18), and transposition was mentioned as a source of scattered gene families earlier in this chapter. Recall that if a transposon "jumps" into the middle of a coding sequence of another gene, it prevents the normal functioning of the interrupted gene (FIGURE 19.4). If the transposon inserts within a sequence that is involved in regulating transcription, the transposition may increase or decrease the production of one or more proteins. In some cases, the transposon itself carries a gene that is activated when it is inserted just downstream from an active promoter. Barbara McClintock was the first to discover transposons when she found evidence for mobile genetic elements that affect the color of developing corn kernels.

Fig 19-4. The effect of a transposon on flower color. Without the movement of a transposon, this morning glory flower would be entirely purple. The white portion of the flower (light blue-green in this photo) resulted from the movement of a transposon in the genome of one cell to a locus that determines purple flower color, destroying the function of the flower-color gene.

Recent studies have revealed that transposons actually make up over 50%  of the corn (maize) genome and 10%  of the human genome. Most of these transposons are retrotransposons, transposable elements that move within a genome by means of an RNA intermediate, a transcript of the retrotransposon DNA (FIGURE 19.5). To insert at another site, the RNA retrotransposon must be converted back to DNA. This is accomplished by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is encoded in the retrotransposon itself, along with an enzyme that catalyzes the insertion at a new site. Thus, reverse transcriptase can be present in cells not infected with retroviruses. (In fact, retroviruses may have evolved from escaped and packaged retrotransposons.) The Alu elements, mentioned earlier, are retrotransposons that do not code for reverse transcriptase but can move using enzymes encoded by other retrotransposons in the genome.

Fig 19-5. Retrotransposon movement. Notice that the retrotransposition mechanism is essentially identical to part of the retrovirus reproductive cycle (see FIGURE 18.7). By replicative transposition, as shown here, a retro-transposon can populate the genome of a multicellular eukaryote in huge numbers.

Immunoglobulin Genes. In vertebrates, at least one set of genes normally undergoes permanent rearrangements of DNA segments. These rearrangements occur in the developing immune system during cellular differentiation, the specialization in cellular structure and function. Several kinds of genes become rearranged as cells of the immune system differentiate. Let's look at the genes encoding antibodies, or immunoglobulins, proteins that specifically recognize and help combat viruses, bacteria, and other invaders of the body.

Immunoglobulins are made by cells of the immune system called B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. B lymphocytes are highly specialized, with each differentiated cell and its descendants producing one specific type of antibody that attacks a specific invader. As an unspecialized cell differentiates into a B lymphocyte, functional antibody genes are pieced together using segments from DNA regions that are physically separated in the genome of an embryonic cell (FIGURE 19.6).

Fig 19-6. DNA rearrangement in the maturation of an immunoglobulin (antibody) gene. The joining of V, J, and C regions of DNA in random combinations plays a major role in arming the immune system with an enormous variety of antibody-producing lymphocytes.

The basic immunoglobulin molecule is represented at the bottom right of FIGURE 19.6.. It consists of four polypeptide chains held together by disulfide bridges. Each chain has two major parts: a constant (C) region, which is the same for all antibodies of a particular class, and a variable (V) region. The variable region gives a particular antibody its unique function--the ability to recognize and bind to a specific foreign molecule. In the genome of an embryonic cell, the DNA sequence coding for the constant part of an antibody polypeptide is separated by a long stretch of DNA from a location containing hundreds of segments coding for variable regions. As a B lymphocyte differentiates, a variable segment of the DNA is connected to a constant segment by the deletion of intervening DNA. This occurs by a type of genetic recombination within the DNA (remember that this is not RNA splicing!). The joined segments form the continuous sequence of nucleotides that functions as the gene for one of the immunoglobulin polypeptides. The combining of different variable and constant regions in this way creates an enormous variety of different polypeptides. And antibody diversity is increased still more by the combining of polypeptides to form complete antibody molecules. As a result, the mature immune system, with millions of subpopulations of B lymphocytes, can make millions of different kinds of antibody molecules.





 Each cell of a multicellular eukaryote expresses only a small fraction of its genes

Interspersed within their masses of noncoding DNA, eukaryotic genomes may contain tens of thousands of genes. Which of these genes are to be expressed? Like unicellular organisms, the cells of multicellular organisms must continually turn certain genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments. In addition, gene expression must be controlled on a long-term basis for cellular differentiation, the divergence in form and function as cells become specialized during an organism's development. Highly specialized cells, such as those of muscle or nervous tissue, express only a tiny fraction of their genes. In fact, a typical human cell expresses only 3-5%  of its genes at any given time. The enzymes that transcribe DNA must locate the right genes at the right time, a task no easier than finding a needle in a haystack. When gene expression goes awry, serious imbalances and diseases, including cancer, can arise. Thus, the question of how eukaryotic genes are regulated is paramount for medical research as well as for basic biology.

Only 35 years ago, an understanding of the mechanisms that control gene expression in eukaryotes seemed almost hopelessly out of reach. Since then, new research methods have empowered molecular biologists to begin to solve these mysteries. Equipped with DNA technology for isolating individual genes and sequencing DNA (discussed in Chapter 20), biologists are now uncovering many of the details of eukaryotic gene regulation.

Despite the extra "nuts and bolts" it requires, the control of gene activity in eukaryotes involves some of the same basic principles as prokaryotic gene regulation. In all organisms, the expression of specific genes is most commonly regulated at the level of transcription by DNA-binding proteins that also interact with other proteins and often with external signals. For that reason, the term gene expression is often equated with gene activity--that is, transcription--for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the greater complexity of eukaryotic cell structure and function provides opportunities for controlling gene expression at additional stages.





 The control of gene expression can occur at any step in the pathway from gene to functional protein: an overview

FIGURE 19.7 is an overview of the entire process of gene expression in a eukaryotic cell. The figure highlights key stages in the expression of a protein-coding gene, from chromatin changes that unpack the DNA, through transcription, RNA processing, and translation, to various alterations of the protein product. The expression of a given gene will not necessarily involve every stage shown; for example, not every polypeptide is cleaved. The main lesson is that each stage is a potential control point where gene expression can be turned on or off, speeded up, or slowed down. The figure omits details and does not convey the web of control that connects different genes and their products. In the following three sections, we'll examine some of the important control points more closely.

Fig 19-7. Opportunities for the control of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The nuclear envelope separating transcription from translation in eukaryotic cells offers opportunity for post-transcriptional control in the form of RNA processing that is absent in bacteria. In addition, eukaryotes have a greater variety of control mechanisms operating before transcription and after translation. In this diagram, the processes that offer opportunities for regulation are highlighted by white or yellow boxes. As in prokaryotes, transcription initiation is the most important control point.





 Chromatin modifications affect the availability of genes for transcription

The organization of chromatin discussed earlier in the chapter serves a dual purpose. One function is to pack the DNA into a compact form that fits inside the nucleus of a cell. The other main function is regulatory: The physical state of DNA in or near a gene is important in helping control whether the gene is available for transcription. Thus, the genes of heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed, presumably because transcription proteins cannot reach the DNA. Also, a gene's location relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether it is transcribed. A flurry of recent research indicates that chemical modifications of chromatin play key roles in both chromatin structure and the regulation of transcription. Especially important are DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Both are catalyzed by specific enzymes.

DNA Methylation

DNA methylation is the attachment of methyl groups (--CH3) to DNA bases after DNA is synthesized. The DNA of most plants and animals has methylated bases, usually cytosine. About 5%  of the cytosine bases in methylated eukaryotic DNA have methyl groups. Inactive DNA, such as that of inactivated mammalian X chromosomes, is generally highly methylated compared to DNA that is actively transcribed, although there are exceptions. Comparison of the same genes in different types of tissues shows that the genes are usually more heavily methylated in cells where they are not expressed. In addition, demethylating certain inactive genes (removing their extra methyl groups) turns them on.

At least in some species, DNA methylation seems to be essential for the long-term inactivation of genes that occurs during cellular differentiation in the embryo. In organisms as different as mice and Arabidopsis (a plant), deficient DNA methylation--resulting from lack of a methylating enzyme, for example--causes abnormalities in embryonic development. Once methylated, genes usually stay that way through successive cell divisions. Methylation enzymes act at DNA sites where one strand is already methylated and thus correctly methylate the daughter strand after each round of DNA replication. In this way, methylation patterns are passed on, and cells forming specialized tissues keep a chemical record of what occurred during embryonic development. A methylation pattern maintained in this way also accounts for genomic imprinting in mammals, where methylation permanently turns off either the maternal or paternal allele of certain genes at the start of development (see FIGURE 15.15).

Histone Acetylation

There is mounting evidence that histone acetylation and deacetylation play a direct role in the regulation of gene transcription. Histone acetylation is the attachment of acetyl groups (--COCH3) to certain amino acids of histone proteins; deacetylation is the removal of acetyl groups. When the histones of a nucleosome are acetylated, they change shape so that they grip the DNA less tightly. As a result, transcription proteins have easier access to genes in the acetylated region. Researchers have shown that some enzymes that acetylate or deacetylate histones are closely associated with or even components of the transcription factors that bind to promoters (see FIGURE 17.7). In other words, histone acetylation and the initiation of gene transcription seem to be coupled structurally as well as functionally. Moreover, researchers have discovered that certain proteins that bind to methylated DNA recruit histone deacetylation enzymes, thus providing a mechanism by which DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can cooperate to repress transcription. In summary, key enzymes that modify chromatin structure are apparently integral parts of the cell's machinery for regulating transcription.





 Transcription initiation is controlled by proteins that interact with DNA and with each other

If chromatin-modifying enzymes provide a coarse adjustment of gene expression by making a region of DNA either more available or less available for transcription, then fine-tuning begins with the interaction of transcription factors with DNA sequences that control specific genes. Indeed, once a gene is "unpacked," the initiation of transcription is the most important and universally used control point in gene expression. Before looking at control mechanisms, let's review the structure of a typical eukaryotic gene and its transcript.

Organization of a Typical Eukaryotic Gene

A eukaryotic gene and the DNA elements (segments) that control it are typically organized as shown in FIGURE 19.8, which reviews and extends what you learned about eukaryotic genes in Chapter 17. One striking difference between this gene and a prokaryotic gene is the presence of introns, noncoding sequences interspersed between coding sequences, the exons. Recall from Chapter 17 that a cluster of proteins called a transcription initiation complex assembles on the promoter sequence at the "upstream" end of the gene, and one of the -proteins, RNA polymerase, proceeds to transcribe the gene. The introns are removed from the primary transcript during RNA processing, so they do not appear in the mature mRNA. The eukaryotic processing of pre-mRNA usually also includes the addition of a modified guanosine triphosphate cap to its 5&#39; end and a poly(A) tail to its 3&#39; end. Another distinctive feature of the eukaryotic gene illustrated in FIGURE 19.8 is the relatively large number of control elements associated with it. Control elements are simply segments of noncoding DNA that help regulate transcription of a gene by binding proteins--transcription factors. (Strictly speaking, control elements include promoters.)

Fig 19-8. A eukaryotic gene and its transcript. Each functional eukaryotic gene has a promoter, a DNA sequence where RNA polymerase binds (with the help of transcription factors) and starts transcription, proceeding "downstream." The 3&#39; end of the transcript is determined by an RNA sequence encoded by a terminator located near the end of the last exon. RNA-processing enzymes immediately add a 5&#39; cap and then a poly(A) tail to the primary transcript, and a spliceosome excises the introns. The resulting mRNA, ready for export to the cytoplasm, includes leader and trailer regions that will not be translated. Involved in regulating the initiation of transcription are a number of control elements (orange), DNA sequences located near (proximal to) or far from (distal to) the promoter. Distal control elements called enhancers can lie either up- stream or downstream of the gene.

The Role of Transcription Factors

As you learned in Chapter 17, eukaryotic RNA polymerase alone cannot initiate transcription of a gene; it is dependent on transcription factors. The transcription factors mentioned in Chapter 17 are essential for the transcription of all protein-coding genes (see FIGURE 17.7). Recall that only one of these transcription factors independently recognizes a DNA sequence, the TATA box within the promoter; the other transcription factors primarily recognize proteins, including each other and RNA polymerase. Protein-protein interactions are crucial to the initiation of eukaryotic transcription. Only when the complete initiation complex has assembled can the polymerase begin to move along the DNA template strand, producing a complementary strand of RNA.

However, the interaction of transcription factors and RNA polymerase with the promoter as summarized so far usually initiates transcription inefficiently, producing only a low rate of initiation and few RNA transcripts. The keys to high levels of eukaryotic transcription are the control elements. These DNA sequences greatly improve the efficiency of promoters by binding additional transcription factors.

As you can see in FIGURE 19.8, some of the control elements on the DNA are close to the promoter; in fact, some biologists include these proximal control elements in what they call the promoter. The more distant distal control elements, called enhancers, may be thousands of nucleotides away from the promoter and may even be downstream of the gene or within an intron. The associations between transcription factors and enhancers play an important role in the control of gene expression in eukaryotes. How do segments of DNA so far away from the promoter influence transcription? Apparently, bending of the DNA enables the transcription factors bound to enhancers to contact proteins of the transcription initiation complex at the promoter (FIGURE 19.9). A transcription factor that binds to an enhancer and stimulates transcription of a gene is termed an activator. Activators help position the initiation complex on the promoter.

Fig 19-9. A model for enhancer action. Bending of the DNA enables enhancers to influence a promoter hundreds or even thousands of nucleotides away. Transcription factors called activators bind to the enhancer DNA sequences and then to proteins of the transcription initiation complex. In the process, they facilitate the correct positioning of the complex on the promoter and the initiation of RNA synthesis.

Do eukaryotic cells also have transcription factors that function as repressors, as bacteria have? Yes, there is evidence for eukaryotic repressors. Some of them bind selectively to DNA control elements called silencers, which may be analogous to enhancers. Activators, though, are probably more important than such repressors, because the main regulatory mode in eukaryotic cells seems to be transcriptional activation of otherwise silent genes. The mechanisms responsible for eukaryotic gene silencing--that is, repression--may operate mostly at the level of chromatin modification (for example, DNA methylation).

In any case, the direct control of transcription largely depends on regulatory proteins that bind selectively to DNA and to other proteins. Hundreds of transcription factors have been discovered in eukaryotes. As numerous as these proteins are, however, they follow a few basic structural principles. A transcription factor generally has a DNA-binding domain, a part of its three-dimensional structure that binds to DNA. There are only a few major types of these domains (FIGURE 19.10). In addition, each transcription factor has a protein-binding domain that recognizes another transcription factor.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 19-10. Three of the major types of DNA-binding domains in transcription factors. The parts of these structural motifs that interact with DNA are mostly a helices (shown as cylinders) that fit into the larger ("major") groove of the double helix. Variations in amino acid sequence within these helices are responsible for the recognition of specific DNA sequences by the protein.

Considering the challenge of regulating the tens of thousands of genes in a typical animal or plant cell, the number of completely different nucleotide sequences found in DNA control elements is surprisingly small. Members of a dozen or so sequences about four to ten base pairs long appear again and again in the control elements for different genes. For many genes, the particular combination of control elements associated with the gene may be more important than the presence of a control element unique to the gene.

Coordinately Controlled Genes

How does the eukaryotic cell deal with genes of related function that need to be turned on or off at the same time? In Chapter 18, you learned that in prokaryotes, such coordinately controlled genes are often clustered into an operon; they lie adjacent to each other in the DNA molecule and share a promoter and other control elements located at the upstream end of the cluster. The genes of the operon are transcribed sequentially into a single mRNA molecule and are translated together. Such operons have not been found in eukaryotic cells, with rare exceptions. Genes coding for the enzymes of a metabolic pathway, for example, are often scattered over different chromosomes in a eukaryotic genome. Even when genes for related functions are located near one another on the same chromosome, each gene has its own promoter and is individually transcribed. Nevertheless, scattered collections of eukaryotic genes are often coordinately expressed.

Coordinate gene expression in eukaryotes probably depends on the association of a specific control element or collection of control elements with every gene of a dispersed group. Copies of the transcription factors that recognize these control elements bind to them, promoting simultaneous transcription of the genes. One example of such coordinate control in eukaryotes is the activation of a variety of genes by a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones--sex hormones, for example--have multiple effects on the body. As you may recall from FIGURE 11.10, a steroid hormone functions as a chemical signal by entering a cell and binding to a specific receptor protein in the cytoplasm or nucleus. When activated by steroid binding, a steroid receptor functions as a transcription activator. Every gene to be turned on by that hormone has a control element recognized by that activator.

Most other kinds of signal molecules, such as nonsteroid hormones or the extracellular signals exchanged by cells in a developing embryo, bind to receptors on the receiving cell's surface and never actually enter the cell. But they can control gene expression indirectly by triggering signal-transduction pathways that lead to the activation of particular transcription factors (see FIGURE 11.17). The principle of coordinate regulation remains the same: Genes with the same control elements are activated by the same chemical signals. Systems for coordinating gene regulation probably evolved by the duplication and distribution of control elements within the genome.





 Post-transcriptional mechanisms play supporting roles in the control of gene expression

Transcription alone does not constitute gene expression. The expression of a protein-coding gene is ultimately measured in terms of the amount of functional protein a cell makes, and much happens between the synthesis of the RNA transcript and the activity of the protein in the cell. In theory, gene expression may be blocked or stimulated at any post-transcriptional step (see FIGURE 19.7). By using regulatory mechanisms that operate after transcription, a cell can rapidly fine-tune gene expression in response to environmental changes without altering its transcription patterns.

RNA processing in the nucleus and the export of mature RNA to the cytoplasm provide several opportunities for controlling gene expression that are not available in bacteria. One example of regulation at the RNA-processing level is alternative RNA splicing, in which different mRNA molecules are produced from the same primary transcript, depending on which RNA segments are treated as exons and which as introns (FIGURE 19.11). Regulatory proteins specific to a cell type control intron-exon choices by binding to regulatory sequences within the primary transcript.

After RNA processing, other stages of gene expression that the cell may regulate are mRNA degradation, translation initiation, and protein processing and degradation.

Regulation of mRNA Degradation

The life span of mRNA molecules in the cytoplasm is an important factor in determining the pattern of protein synthesis in a cell. Prokaryotic mRNA molecules typically have very short lives; they are degraded by enzymes after only a few minutes. This is one reason bacteria can vary their patterns of protein synthesis so quickly in response to environmental changes. In contrast, mRNA lifetimes in multicellular eukaryotes are typically hours and can be days or even weeks. A striking example of long-lived mRNA is found in developing red blood cells, which are factories for the production of the protein hemoglobin. The mRNAs for the hemoglobin polypeptides (a-globin and b-globin) are unusually stable and are translated repeatedly in these cells.

Recent research on yeasts suggests that a common pathway of mRNA breakdown begins with the enzymatic shortening of the poly(A) tail. This helps trigger the action of enzymes that remove the 5&#39; cap (the two ends of the mRNA may be briefly held together by the proteins involved). The removal of the cap, a critical step, is also regulated by particular nucleotide sequences in the mRNA. Once the cap is removed, nuclease enzymes rapidly chew up the mRNA from its 5&#39; end.

Nucleotide sequences that affect mRNA stability are often found in the untranslated trailer region at the 3&#39; end of the molecule (see FIGURE 19.8). In one experiment, researchers transferred such a sequence from the short-lived mRNA for a growth factor to the 3&#39; end of a normally stable globin mRNA. The globin mRNA was quickly degraded.

Control of Translation

Most translational control mechanisms block the initiation stage of polypeptide synthesis, when ribosomal subunits and the initiator tRNA attach to an mRNA (see FIGURE 17.15). Translation of specific mRNAs can be blocked by regulatory proteins that bind to specific sequences or structures within the leader region at the 5&#39; end of the mRNA, preventing the attachment of ribosomes. This mechanism is important in embryonic development: The mother stores in the ovum a variety of mRNAs that are not translated until specific stages after fertilization.

Protein factors required to initiate translation in eukaryotes offer targets for simultaneously controlling the translation of all the mRNA in a cell. One example of such "global" control involves hemoglobin. A functional hemoglobin molecule has four heme groups, one attached to each polypeptide (see FIGURE 19.3). If hemes are in short supply in a developing red blood cell, a regulatory protein inactivates an essential translation initiation factor by phosphorylating it. This inhibits all translation, but mainly affects translation of hemoglobin mRNA, which constitutes most of the mRNA in the cell.

Global control of translation is important in embryonic development. For example, the egg cells of many organisms synthesize and store large numbers of mRNA molecules that are not translated until just after fertilization. At that point, translation is triggered by the sudden activation of translation initiation factors. The response is a burst of synthesis of particular proteins. Some plants and algae store mRNAs during periods of darkness; light then triggers the reactivation of the translational apparatus.

Protein Processing and Degradation

The final opportunities for controlling gene expression occur after translation. Often, eukaryotic polypeptides must be processed to yield functional protein molecules. The cleavage of the initial insulin polypeptide to form the active hormone is an example. In addition, many proteins require chemical modifications to function. For instance, proteins destined for the animal cell surface must acquire sugars, and regulatory proteins are commonly activated or inactivated by the reversible addition of phosphate groups. Moreover, polypeptides must often be transported to targeted destinations in the cell in order to function. Regulation might occur at any of the steps involved in modifying or transporting a protein.

Abnormal targeting of a protein can have serious consequences, as, for example, in cystic fibrosis. This disease results from mutations in the gene for a protein that functions as a chloride ion channel. The defective protein never reaches its final destination in the cell, the plasma membrane, and is rapidly degraded.

In addition to degrading defective and damaged proteins, the cell limits the lifetimes of normal proteins by selective degradation. Many proteins, such as the cyclins involved in regulating the cell cycle, must be relatively short-lived if the cell is to function appropriately (see FIGURE 12.14). To mark a particular protein for destruction, the cell commonly attaches molecules of a small protein called ubiquitin to the protein. Giant protein complexes called proteasomes then recognize the ubiquitin and degrade the tagged protein (FIGURE 19.12). The importance of proteasomes is underscored by the finding that mutations making cell cycle proteins impervious to proteasome degradation can lead to cancer.

Fig 19-12. Degradation of a protein by a proteasome. A proteasome is an enormous protein complex, with a shape suggesting a trash can, that chops up unneeded proteins in the cell. In most cases, the proteins attacked by a proteasome have been tagged with short chains of ubiquitin, a small protein. 
			  
		 Enzymes in the cytosol attach ubiquitin molecules to a protein. (It is not known how the protein is selected.) 
			  
		 A proteasome recognizes the ubiquitinated protein, unfolds it, and sequesters it in its central cavity. 
			  
		 Enzymatic components of the proteasome cut the protein into small peptides, which can be further degraded by cytosolic enzymes. Steps 1 and 3 require ATP. Eukaryotic proteasomes are as massive as ribosomal subunits and are distributed throughout the cell. Their barrel-like shape somewhat resembles that of chaperone proteins, which nurture protein structure rather than destroy it (see FIGURE 5.26).





 Cancer results from genetic changes that affect the cell cycle

Certain genes normally regulate cell growth and division--the cell cycle--and mutations that alter those genes in somatic cells can lead to cancer. The agent of such change can be random spontaneous mutation. However, it is likely that many cancer-causing mutations result from environmental influences such as chemical carcinogens, physical mutagens such as X-rays, or certain viruses. In fact, a breakthrough in understanding cancer came from the study of tumors induced by viruses. This research led to the discovery of cancer-causing genes called oncogenes in certain retroviruses (from the Greek onco, tumor). Subsequently, close counterparts of these oncogenes were found in the genomes of humans and other animals. The normal cellular genes, called proto-oncogenes, code for proteins that stimulate normal cell growth and division. (To review the cell cycle, see Chapter 12.)

How might a proto-oncogene--a gene that has an essential function in normal cells--become an oncogene, a cancer-causing gene? In general, an oncogene arises from a ge-netic change that leads to an increase in either the amount of the proto-oncogene's protein product or the intrinsic activity of each protein molecule. The genetic changes that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes fall into three main categories: movement of DNA within the genome, amplification of a proto-oncogene, and point mutation in a proto-oncogene (FIGURE 19.13). Malignant cells are frequently found to contain chromosomes that have broken and rejoined incorrectly, translocating fragments from one chromosome to another (see FIGURE 15.13). A proto-oncogene ending up in the joint region may now lie adjacent to an especially active promoter (or other control element) that increases transcription of the gene, making it an oncogene. An increase in gene expression can also arise when a proto-oncogene comes under the control of a more active promoter by transposition of either the gene or the promoter within a chromosome. The second main type of genetic change, amplification, increases the number of copies of the gene in the cell. The third possibility is a point mutation that changes the gene's protein product to one that is more active or more resistant to degradation than the normal protein. All these mechanisms can lead to abnormal stimulation of the cell cycle and put the cell on the path to malignancy.

Fig 19-13. Genetic changes that can turn proto-oncogenes into oncogenes.

In addition to mutations affecting growth-stimulating proteins, changes in genes whose normal products inhibit cell division also contribute to cancer. Such genes are called tumor-suppressor genes because the proteins they encode normally help prevent uncontrolled cell growth. Any mutation that decreases the normal activity of a tumor-suppressor protein may contribute to the onset of cancer, in effect stimulating growth through the absence of suppression. The protein products of tumor-suppressor genes have various functions. For instance, some tumor-suppressor proteins normally repair damaged DNA, a function that prevents the cell from accumulating -cancer-causing mutations. Other tumor-suppressor proteins control the adhesion of cells to each other or to an extracellular matrix; proper cell anchorage is crucial in normal tissues--and often absent in cancers. Still other tumor-suppressor proteins are components of cell-signaling pathways that inhibit the cell cycle.

We'll encounter some important tumor-suppressor proteins and oncogene proteins in the next section, as we examine their roles in cell-signaling pathways.





 Oncogene proteins and faulty tumor-suppressor proteins interfere with normal signaling pathways

Let's take a closer look at what the protein products of cancer genes do--or fail to do--in the cell. We will focus on the products of two key genes, the ras proto-oncogene and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Mutations in these genes are very common in human cancers: ras is mutated in about 30%  of human cancers; for p53, the frequency is close to 50% .

Both the Ras protein and the p53 protein are components of signal-transduction pathways that convey external signals to the DNA in the cell's nucleus. You saw a generalized version of such a pathway in FIGURE 11.17. Now, in FIGURE 19.14a you can see that Ras, the product of the ras gene, is a G protein that relays a growth signal from a growth factor receptor on the plasma membrane to a cascade of protein kinases. The cellular response at the end of the pathway is the synthesis of a protein that stimulates the cell cycle. Normally, such a pathway will not operate unless triggered by the appropriate growth factor. However, an oncogene protein that is a hyperactive version of a protein in the pathway can increase cell division even in the absence of growth factor. Many ras oncogenes have a point mutation that leads to a hyperactive version of the Ras protein, one that issues signals on its own. In fact, hyperactive versions or excess amounts of any of the pathway's components can have the same outcome: excessive cell division.

Fig 19-14. Signaling pathways that regulate cell growth. Both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways regulate the cell cycle, commonly by influencing transcription. Cancer can result from aberrations in such pathways.

FIGURE 19.14b shows a comparable growth-inhibiting pathway, in which a growth-inhibiting signal leads to the synthesis of a protein that suppresses the cell cycle. Thus, the genes for the components of the pathway act as tumor-suppressor genes (as do genes whose products interfere with the growth-stimulating pathway). The tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the wild-type p53 gene is a transcription factor that promotes the synthesis of growth-inhibiting proteins. That is why a mutation knocking out the p53 gene can lead to excessive cell growth and cancer.

The modestly titled p53 gene, named for the 53,000-dalton molecular weight of its protein product, is often called the "guardian angel of the genome." Damage to the cell's DNA acts as a signal that leads to the expression of the p53 gene. Once made, the p53 protein functions as a transcription factor for several genes. Often it activates a gene called p21, whose product halts the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing time for the cell to repair the DNA; the protein p53 can also turn on genes directly involved in DNA repair. When DNA damage is irreparable, p53 activates "suicide" genes, whose protein products cause cell death by a process called apoptosis (see FIGURE 21.18). Thus, in at least three ways, p53 prevents a cell from passing on mutations due to DNA damage. If mutations do accumulate and the cell survives through many divisions--as is more likely if the p53 tumor-suppressor gene is defective or missing--cancer may ensue.





 Multiple mutations underlie the development of cancer

More than one somatic mutation is generally needed to produce all the changes characteristic of a full-fledged cancer cell. This may help explain why the incidence of cancer increases greatly with age. If cancer results from an accumulation of mutations and if mutations occur throughout life, then the longer we live, the more likely we are to develop cancer.

The model of a multi-step path to cancer is well supported by studies of one of the best understood types of human cancer, colorectal cancer. About 135,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States. Like most cancers, colorectal cancer develops gradually (FIGURE 19.15). The first sign is often a polyp, which is a small, benign growth in the colon lining. The cells of the polyp look normal, although they divide unusually frequently. The tumor grows and may eventually become malignant. The development of a malignant tumor is paralleled by a gradual accumulation of mutations that activate oncogenes and knock out tumor-suppressor genes. A ras oncogene and a mutated p53 tumor-suppressor gene are often involved.

Fig 19-15. A multi-step model for the development of colorectal cancer. Affecting the colon and/or rectum, this type of cancer is one of the best understood. Changes in a tumor parallel a series of genetic changes, including mutations affecting several tumor-suppressor genes (such as p53) and the ras proto-oncogene. Mutations of tumor-suppressor genes often entail loss (deletion) of the gene. APC stands for "adenomatous polyposis coli"; mutant APC alleles are carried in many families predisposed to colorectal cancer. DCC stands for "deleted in colorectal cancer." Other mutation sequences can also lead to cancer.

About a half dozen changes must occur at the DNA level for a cell to become fully cancerous. These usually include the appearance of at least one active oncogene and the mutation or loss of several tumor-suppressor genes. Furthermore, since mutant tumor-suppressor alleles are usually recessive, mutations must knock out both alleles in a cell's genome to block tumor suppression. (Most oncogenes, on the other hand, behave as dominant alleles.) Finally, in many malignant tumors, the gene for telomerase is activated. This enzyme prevents the erosion of the ends of the chromosomes, thus removing a natural limit on the number of times the cells can divide (see pp. 299-301).

Viruses seem to play a role in about 15%  of human cancer cases worldwide. For example, retroviruses are involved in some types of leukemia, hepatitis viruses can cause liver cancer, and certain wart viruses promote the development of cancer of the cervix. Viruses contribute to cancer development by integrating their genetic material into the DNA of infected cells. By this process, a retrovirus may donate an oncogene to the cell. Alternatively, viral DNA may insert into a cellular genome in a way that disrupts a tumor-suppressor gene or converts a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.

The fact that multiple genetic changes are required to produce a cancer cell helps explain the predispositions to cancer that run in some families. An individual inheriting an oncogene or a mutant allele of a tumor-suppressor gene will be one step closer to accumulating the necessary mutations for cancer to develop.

Geneticists are now devoting much effort to finding inherited cancer alleles so that predisposition to certain cancers can be detected early in life. About 15%  of colorectal cancers, for example, involve inherited mutations. Some of these affect DNA repair genes. Many others affect a tumor-suppressor gene called APC (see FIGURE 19.15). This gene seems to have multiple functions in the cell, including regulation of cell migration and adhesion. In 1997, researchers discovered a previously unrecognized mutation in APC carried by 6%  of Ashkenazic Jews, making it the most common cancer-predisposing mutation yet found in a defined ethnic group.

Inherited alleles involved in breast cancer are also being scrutinized. Understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer is particularly important because it is the second most common type of cancer in the United States, striking over 180,000 women (and some men) each year. In 5-10%  of breast cancer cases, there is evidence of a strong inherited predisposition. In 1994 and 1995, researchers identified two genes involved in these breast cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA stands for BReast CAncer). Mutations in either gene increase the risk of developing breast cancer, and of ovarian cancer as well. Both genes are considered tumor-suppressor genes because their wild-type alleles protect against breast cancer and because their mutant alleles are recessive. However, determining what the normal products of BRCA1 and BRCA2 actually do in the cell has proved very difficult. One hypothesis is that one or both proteins are involved in DNA repair. Whatever the answer, the study of these and other genes associated with inherited cancer may lead to new methods for early diagnosis and treatment of all cancers. The DNA technologies you will learn about in the next Chapter figure prominently in this research.

The photo on this page shows a room of machines that are sequencing human DNA at the rate of 350,000 nucleotides per machine per day. The mapping and sequencing of the human genome, one of the great achievements of modern science, has been made possible by advances in DNA technology, starting with the invention of methods for making recombinant DNA. This is DNA in which genes from two different sources--often different species--are combined in vitro into the same molecule.

The methods for making recombinant DNA are also central to genetic engineering, the direct manipulation of genes for practical purposes. Applications include the manufacture of hundreds of products. Using DNA technology, scientists can make recombinant DNA and then introduce it into cultured cells that replicate the DNA and may express its genes, yielding a desired protein. The bacterium E. coli is often used as a "host" organism for recombinant DNA because it is easy to grow and its biochemistry is well understood.

DNA technology has launched a revolution in biotechnology. In broad terms, biotechnology is the manipulation of organisms or their components to make useful products. Practices that go back centuries, such as the use of microbes to make wine and cheese and the selective breeding of livestock, are examples of biotechnology. Natural genetic processes, such as mutation and genetic recombination, have always been involved. But biotechnology based on the manipulation of DNA in vitro differs from earlier practices by enabling scientists to modify specific genes and move them between organisms as distinct as bacteria, plants, and animals.

DNA technology is now applied in areas ranging from agriculture to criminal law, but its most important achievements have been in basic research. DNA technology has stimulated discoveries in virtually all fields of biology by giving researchers new tools for tackling age-old questions. And it is providing us with detailed knowledge of the genomes of humans and many other organisms, knowledge largely inaccessible only a few decades ago.

In this chapter, we describe the main techniques of DNA manipulation, discuss how genomes are analyzed at the DNA level, and survey the practical applications of DNA technology. In a concluding section, we consider some of the social and ethical issues that arise as DNA technology becomes more pervasive in our lives.

 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clones DNA entirely in vitro



The molecular biologist studying a particular gene faces a challenge. Naturally occurring DNA molecules are very long, and a single molecule usually carries many genes. Moreover, genes may occupy only a small proportion of the chromosomal DNA, the rest being noncoding nucleotide sequences. A human gene, for example, might constitute only 1/100,000 of a chromosomal DNA molecule. As a further complication, the distinctions between a gene and the surrounding DNA are subtle, consisting only of differences in nucleotide sequence. To work directly with specific genes, scientists needed to develop methods for preparing well-defined, gene-sized pieces of DNA in multiple identical copies. In other words, they needed techniques for gene cloning.

 Genome sequences provide clues to important biological questions



Once we have techniques for preparing homogeneous samples of DNA, each containing large numbers of identical segments of a genome, we can begin to ask some far-ranging questions. Suppose we have cloned a DNA segment carrying a human gene of interest. Does the gene differ in different people, and are there certain alleles associated with a hereditary disorder? Where in the body and when is the gene expressed? What is the location of the gene within the genome? We can also address evolutionary questions by asking how the gene differs from species to species.

To answer such questions fully, we will eventually need to know the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene and its counterparts in other individuals and species. And ultimately, we want to have the sequences of entire genomes available so that we can use them as the basis for studying whole sets of genes and their interactions--an approach called genomics. But we can start by analyzing cloned DNA by means of more indirect methods that can rapidly provide useful comparative information. Most of these methods, and DNA sequencing as well, make use of a technique called gel electrophoresis. This technique, described in FIGURE 20.8 (p. 384), separates macromolecules--nucleic acids or proteins--on the basis of size, electrical charge, and other physical properties. For linear molecules of DNA, separation depends mainly on size. Gel electrophoresis sorts a mixture of DNA molecules into bands, each consisting of DNA molecules of the same length.

Fig 20-8. Gel electrophoresis of macromolecules. Gel electrophoresis separates macromolecules on the basis of their rate of movement through a gel in an electric field. For DNA, the migration rate--how far a molecule travels while the current is on--is inversely proportional to molecular size. Nucleic acids carry negative charges (on phosphate groups) proportional to their lengths, but the thicket of polymer fibers in the gel impedes longer fragments more than it does shorter ones.

Hardly a day goes by that DNA technology is not in the news. More often than not, the topic of the story is a new and promising application to a medical problem.





 DNA technology makes it possible to clone genes for basic research and commercial applications: an overview

Most methods for cloning pieces of DNA share certain general features. In FIGURE 20.1, an overview of gene cloning and its applications, we consider an approach that uses bacteria and their plasmids. Recall from Chapter 18 that plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that replicate within bacterial cells, separate from the bacterial chromosome. For cloning genes or other pieces of DNA, plasmids are first isolated from bacterial cells. FIGURE 20.1 follows one plasmid as a foreign gene is inserted into it. The plasmid is now a recombinant DNA molecule, combining DNA from two sources. The plasmid is returned to a bacterial cell, which then reproduces to form a cell clone. The foreign gene carried by the plasmid is "cloned" at the same time, for the dividing bacteria continue to replicate the recombinant plasmid and pass it on to their descendants. Under suitable conditions, the bacterial clone will make the protein encoded by the foreign gene.

		 A critical step in gene cloning is the identification of the bacterial clone carrying the gene of interest. 
			  
		 The drawings show some current applications of gene cloning in bacteria. In the examples on the left, a gene that originated in one organism is used to give another organism a new metabolic capability. In the cases on the right, useful protein products are harvested in large quantities from bacterial cultures. In this and later figures, the bacterial chromosomes and plasmids are not to scale; relative to the cells, the chromosomes are actually much larger and the plasmids much smaller.

The potential uses of cloned genes fall into two general categories. The goal may be to produce a protein product, either for study or for some practical use. For example, pharmaceutical companies use bacteria carrying the gene for human growth hormone to produce large quantities of the hormone for treating stunted growth. Alternatively, the goal may be to prepare many copies of the gene itself. A scientist may want to determine the gene's nucleotide sequence or use the gene to endow an organism with a new metabolic capability. For example, a cloned gene for pest resistance originating in one species of crop plant might be transferred into plants of another species. Most genes exist in only one copy per genome--something on the order of one part per million of DNA--so the ability to clone such rare DNA fragments is extremely valuable. In the remainder of this chapter, we take a closer look at the steps in FIGURE 20.1 and at related methods.





 Restriction enzymes are used to make recombinant DNA

Gene cloning and genetic engineering were made possible by the discovery of enzymes that cut DNA molecules at a limited number of specific locations. These enzymes, called restriction enzymes, were discovered in the late 1960s by researchers studying bacteria. In nature, these enzymes protect the bacteria against intruding DNA from other organisms, such as phages or other bacterial cells. They work by cutting up the foreign DNA, a process called restriction. Most restriction enzymes are very specific, recognizing short nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules and cutting at specific points within these sequences. The bacterial cell protects its own DNA from restriction by adding methyl groups (CH3) to adenines or cytosines within the sequences recognized by the restriction enzyme. Hundreds of different restriction enzymes have been identified and isolated.

The top of FIGURE 20.2 is a diagram of a DNA molecule containing a recognition sequence, or restriction site, for a particular restriction enzyme. As shown in this example, most restriction sites are symmetrical: The same 5&#39; 3&#39; sequence of four to eight nucleotides (here, six) is found on both strands, thus running in opposite directions (antiparallel). Restriction enzymes cut covalent phosphodiester bonds of both strands, often in a staggered way, as indicated in the diagram. Because the target sequence usually occurs (by chance) many times in a long DNA molecule, an enzyme will make many cuts. Copies of a DNA molecule always yield the same set of restriction fragments when exposed to that enzyme. In other words, a restriction enzyme cuts a DNA molecule in a reproducible way. (Later you will learn how the different fragments can be separated.)

Fig 20-2. Using a restriction enzyme and DNA ligase to make recombinant DNA. The restriction enzyme in this example (called EcoRI) recognizes a specific six-base-pair sequence and makes staggered cuts in the sugar-phosphate backbone within this sequence. Complementary "sticky ends" will attach to each other by hydrogen bonding, transiently rejoining fragments in their original combinations or in new, recombinant arrangements. DNA ligase can then catalyze the formation of covalent bonds, joining their ends. If the fragments are from different sources, the result is recombinant DNA.

Notice in FIGURE 20.2 that the restriction fragments are double-stranded DNA fragments with at least one single-stranded end, called a sticky end. These short extensions will form hydrogen-bonded base pairs with complementary single-stranded stretches on other DNA molecules cut with the same enzyme. The unions formed in this way are only temporary, because only a few hydrogen bonds hold the fragments together. The DNA fusions can be made permanent, however, by the enzyme DNA ligase, which seals the strands by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds. (Recall from Chapter 16 that DNA ligase is a key enzyme in DNA replication and repair.) We now have recombinant DNA, DNA that has been spliced together from two different sources.





 Genes can be cloned in recombinant DNA vectors: a closer look

With a restriction enzyme and DNA ligase in our toolkit, we can make the recombinant plasmid depicted in step 2 of FIGURE 20.1. The original plasmid is called a cloning vector, defined as a DNA molecule that can carry foreign DNA into a cell and replicate there. Bacterial plasmids are widely used as cloning vectors. Recombinant plasmids produced by splicing restriction fragments from foreign DNA into plasmids isolated from bacteria can be returned relatively easily to bacteria. Then, as a bacterium carrying a recombinant plasmid reproduces, the plasmid replicates within it. The resulting cell clone, which appears as a colony on solid nutrient medium, contains multiple copies--a "clone"--of the foreign DNA.

Bacteria are the most commonly used host cells for gene cloning, primarily because of the ease with which DNA can be isolated from and reintroduced into such cells. Bacterial cultures also grow quickly, rapidly replicating any foreign genes they carry.

Procedure for Cloning a Eukaryotic Gene in a Bacterial Plasmid

Suppose we want to clone a particular eukaryotic gene using the method sketched out in steps 1-5 of FIGURE 20.1. The more detailed diagram in FIGURE 20.3 shows one way we might proceed. The step numbers in the text that follows correspond to the numbers in the figure.

Fig 20-3. Cloning a human gene in a bacterial plasmid: a closer look. In this figure, double-stranded DNA is represented as a single band. (Refer to FIGURE 20.2 to see steps 2a-2c in more detail.) The circled numbers correspond to numbered steps in the text. The diagram focuses on a fragment of human DNA carrying a gene of interest (black), but steps 2a-2c actually produce an enormous variety of recombinant plasmids, each of which shows up as a separate colony in step 4. The method used to identify the clones of interest (step 4b) relies on the ampR and lacZ genes of the vector used here; other vectors and identification methods can also be used. Identifying the desired colony, step 5, is often the greatest challenge in this "shotgun" procedure.


			  
		Isolation of vector and gene-source DNA. We begin by preparing two kinds of DNA: the bacterial plasmid we'll use as a vector and DNA containing the gene of interest. This latter DNA comes from human tissue cells that we have grown in laboratory culture. The plasmid comes from the bacterium E. coli and carries two genes that will later prove useful: ampR, conferring resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin on its E. coli host cell, and lacZ, encoding the enzyme b-galactosidase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sugar lactose. The plasmid has a single recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme used, and the sequence lies within the lacZ gene.


			  
		Insertion of DNA into the vector. In step 2a, we digest both the plasmid and the human DNA with the same restriction enzyme. The enzyme cuts the plasmid DNA at its single restriction site, disrupting the lacZ gene. It also cuts the human DNA, generating many thousands of fragments; one of these fragments carries the gene we want. In making the cuts, the restriction enzyme creates compatible sticky ends on both the human DNA fragments and the plasmid. For simplicity, FIGURE 20.3 shows the step-by-step processing of one human DNA fragment and one plasmid; but actually, millions of copies of the plasmid and a heterogeneous mixture of millions of human DNA fragments are treated simultaneously.

In step 2b, we mix the fragments of human DNA with the clipped plasmids. The sticky ends of a plasmid base-pair with the complementary sticky ends of the human DNA fragment we are following. (Many other combinations form as well, such as two plasmids together or a plasmid with several DNA fragments; and re-formed, nonrecombinant plasmids are also common.) In step 2c, we use the enzyme DNA ligase to join the DNA molecules by covalent bonds. The result is a mixture of recombinant DNA molecules, some of which are like the one shown.


			  
		Introduction of the cloning vector into cells. In this step, bacterial cells take up the recombinant plasmids by transformation (the uptake of naked DNA from the surrounding solution; see pp. 341-342). The bacteria are lacZ- a mutation in gene lacZ makes them unable to hydrolyze lactose. Some of the bacteria acquire the desired recombinant plasmid DNA; many other cells take up other DNA, both recombinant and nonrecombinant.


			  
		Cloning of cells (and foreign genes). Finally, we arrive at the actual cloning step. We plate out the transformed bacteria on solid nutrient medium containing ampicillin and a sugar called X-gal (step 4a). Each reproducing bacterium forms a cell clone that appears as a colony on the nutrient medium. In the process, any human genes carried by recombinant plasmids are also cloned. We take advantage of the plasmid's own genes to select colonies of cells that carry recombinant plasmids. The ampicillin in the medium ensures that only plasmid-containing cells grow, for only they have the ampR gene conferring ampicillin resistance. The X-gal in the medium makes it easy to identify colonies of bacteria whose plasmids carry foreign DNA. X-gal is hydrolyzed by b-galactosidase to yield a blue product, so bacterial colonies containing plasmids with intact b-galactosidase genes will be blue. But if a plasmid has foreign DNA inserted into its lacZ gene, then a colony of cells containing it will be white, because the cells cannot produce b-galactosidase. In summary, with this method, bacteria with recombinant plasmids carrying foreign DNA will form white colonies on medium containing ampicillin and X-gal (step 4b).

Our procedure to this point will have cloned many different human DNA fragments, not just the one that interests us. The next step, screening colonies for the desired human gene, is the most difficult.


			  
		Identification of cell clones carrying the gene of interest. How can we distinguish the colony containing our gene of interest from the many thousands of colonies carrying other pieces of human DNA? We can look either for the gene itself or for its protein product. All the methods for detecting the DNA of a gene directly depend on base pairing between the gene and a complementary sequence on another nucleic acid molecule, a process called nucleic acid hybridization. The complementary molecule, a short, single-stranded nucleic acid that can be either RNA or DNA, is called a nucleic acid probe. If we know at least part of the nucleotide sequence of our gene (perhaps from knowledge of the protein it encodes), we can synthesize a probe complementary to it.

We trace the probe, which will hydrogen-bond specifically to complementary single strands of the desired gene, by labeling it with a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent tag. FIGURE 20.4 (p. 380) shows how a number of bacterial clones, growing as colonies on a plate of solid medium (agar), can be simultaneously screened for the presence of DNA complementary to a DNA probe. An essential step is the denaturation of the cells' DNA--that is, the separation of its two strands. As with protein denaturation, DNA denaturation is routinely accomplished with chemicals or heat. The labeled probe tags the colonies carrying the targeted gene.

Fig 20-4. Using a nucleic acid probe to identify a cloned gene. This technique depends on the fact that complementary nucleotide sequences will base-pair, stuck together by hydrogen bonds. Here the cloned gene of interest is carried on a bacterial plasmid, and the probe is a short length of radioactive single-stranded DNA complementary to part of the gene. 
			  
		 Bacterial colonies on agar are pressed against special filter paper, transferring cells to the filter. 
			  
		 The filter is treated to break open the cells and denature their DNA; the resulting single-stranded DNA molecules stick to the filter. 
			  
		 A solution of probe molecules is incubated with the filter. The probe DNA hybridizes (base-pairs) with any complementary DNA on the filter; excess DNA is rinsed off. 
			  
		 The filter is laid on photographic film, allowing any radioactive areas to expose the film (autoradiography). 
			  
		 The developed film, an autoradiograph, is compared with the master culture plate to determine which colonies carry the desired gene.

Once we've identified a cell clone carrying the desired gene, we can grow the cells in liquid culture in a large tank and then easily isolate large amounts of the gene. Also, we can use the cloned gene itself as a probe to identify similar or identical genes in DNA from other sources.

If the cells containing a desired gene translate the gene into protein, then it is sometimes possible to identify them by screening all clones for the protein. Detection of the protein can be based on either its activity (as with an enzyme) or its structure, using antibodies that bind specifically to it. However, for bacterial cells to make a eukaryotic protein, we need to take special measures, as discussed next.

Cloning and Expressing Eukaryotic Genes: Problems and Solutions

Getting a cloned eukaryotic gene to function in a prokaryotic setting can be difficult because certain details of gene expression are different in the two kinds of cells. To overcome differences in promoters and other DNA control sequences, scientists usually employ an expression vector, a cloning vector that contains the requisite prokaryotic promoter just upstream of a restriction site where the eukaryotic gene can be inserted. The bacterial host cell will then recognize the promoter and proceed to express the foreign gene that has been linked to it. Expression vectors allow the synthesis of many eukaryotic proteins in bacterial cells.

Another problem with cloning and expressing eukaryotic DNA in bacteria is the presence of long noncoding regions (introns) in most eukaryotic genes. Introns can make a eukaryotic gene very long and unwieldy, and they prevent correct expression of the gene by bacterial cells, which do not have RNA-splicing machinery. Fortunately, we can make artificial eukaryotic genes that lack introns (FIGURE 20.5). The starting material for this procedure is fully processed mRNA, which has been stripped of introns in the eukaryotic cell nucleus. We can extract this mRNA from cells and then use the enzyme reverse transcriptase (obtained from retroviruses) to make DNA transcripts of this RNA. Each DNA molecule produced carries the complete coding sequence for a gene but no introns. This DNA is called complementary DNA, or cDNA, and can be attached to vector DNA for replication inside a cell. Bacteria can express a eukaryotic cDNA gene if the vector provides a bacterial promoter and any other control elements necessary for the gene's transcription and translation.

Fig 20-5. Making complementary DNA (cDNA) for a eukaryotic gene. Complementary DNA is DNA made in vitro using mRNA as a template and the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The synthesis and splicing of an mRNA molecule in a cell nucleus is shown in steps 
			  
		 and 
			  
		. In step 
			  
		, we isolate the mRNA molecules from the cell and add reverse transcriptase, which makes a DNA strand using the RNA as a template. We provide 
			  
		 another enzyme to degrade the RNA and 
			  
		 DNA polymerase to synthesize a second DNA strand. The result is cDNA, which carries the complete coding sequence of the gene but no introns.

Molecular biologists can avoid eukaryotic-prokaryotic incompatibility by using eukaryotic cells rather than bacteria as hosts for cloning and/or expressing eukaryotic genes of interest. Yeast cells, single-celled fungi, offer two advantages: They are as easy to grow as bacteria, and they have plasmids, a rarity among eukaryotes. Scientists have even constructed recombinant plasmids that combine yeast and bacterial DNA and can replicate in either type of cell. Scientists have also constructed vectors called yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) that combine the essentials of a eukaryotic chromosome--an origin for DNA replication, a centromere, and two telomeres--with foreign DNA. These chromosomes behave normally in mitosis, cloning the foreign DNA as the yeast cell divides. A YAC can carry much more DNA than can a plasmid vector, enabling very long pieces of DNA to be cloned.

Another reason to use eukaryotic host cells for expressing a cloned eukaryotic gene is that many eukaryotic proteins will not function unless they are modified after translation, for example by the addition of carbohydrate or lipid groups. Bacterial cells cannot carry out these modifications, and if the gene product requiring such processing is from a mammal, even yeast cells will not be able to modify the protein correctly. The use of host cells from an animal or plant cell culture may therefore be necessary.

Like bacteria, many kinds of eukaryotic cells can take up DNA from their surroundings but sometimes not very efficiently. To deal with this problem, scientists have developed a variety of more aggressive methods for introducing recombinant DNA into cells. In electroporation, they apply a brief electrical pulse to a solution containing cells. The electricity creates a temporary hole in the cell's plasma membrane, through which DNA can enter. (This technique is now commonly used for bacteria as well.) Alternatively, scientists can inject DNA directly into single eukaryotic cells using microscopically thin needles. And in a technique used primarily for plant cells, they can attach DNA to microscopic particles of metal and fire the particles into cells with a gun (see FIGURE 38.17). Once inside the cell, the DNA has a chance to be incorporated into the cell's DNA by natural genetic recombination.





 Cloned genes are stored in DNA libraries

Because the gene-cloning procedure in FIGURE 20.3 starts with a mixture of fragments from the entire genome of an organism, it is called a "shotgun" approach--no single gene is targeted for cloning. Thousands of different recombinant plasmids are actually produced in step 2 of FIGURE 20.3, and a clone of each ends up in a (white) colony in step 4. The complete set of thousands of recombinant plasmid clones, each carrying copies of a particular segment from the initial genome, is referred to as a genomic library (FIGURE 20.6a). A researcher can save such a library and use it as a source of other genes of interest or for genome mapping (as we'll discuss later).

Fig 20-6. Genomic libraries. A genomic library is a collection of many bacterial or phage clones, each containing copies of a particular DNA segment from a foreign genome. In a complete genomic library, the foreign DNA segments represented cover the entire genome of an organism. This diagram shows parts of two genomic libraries.

In addition to plasmids, certain bacteriophages are also common cloning vectors for making genomic libraries. Fragments of foreign DNA can be spliced into a phage genome, as into a plasmid, by using a restriction enzyme and ligase. The recombinant phage DNA is then packaged into capsids in vitro and introduced into a bacterial cell through the normal infection process. Once inside the cell, the phage DNA replicates and produces new phage particles, each carrying the foreign DNA. A genomic library made using phage is stored as collections of phage clones (FIGURE 20.6b). Whatever the cloning vector, restriction enzymes do not respect gene boundaries in cutting up genomic DNA, so some genes in a genomic library may be divided up among two or more clones.

Researchers can make a more limited kind of gene library by using complementary DNA (cDNA). When they first isolate mRNA from cells (step 3 in FIGURE 20.5), they actually obtain a mixture of all the mRNA molecules in the cell, transcribed from a number of different genes. Therefore, the cDNA that is made is a library containing a collection of genes. Such a cDNA library represents only part of a cell's genome--only the genes that were transcribed in the starting cells. This is an advantage if a researcher wants to study the genes responsible for specialized functions of a particular kind of cell, such as a brain or liver cell. Also, by making cDNA from cells of the same type at different times in the life of an organism, one can trace changes in patterns of gene expression.





 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) clones DNA entirely in vitro

DNA cloning in cells remains the best method for preparing large quantities of a particular gene or other DNA sequence. However, when the source of DNA is scanty or impure, a method called PCR is quicker and more selective. PCR, the polymerase chain reaction, is a technique by which any piece of DNA can be quickly amplified (copied many times) without using cells (FIGURE 20.7). The DNA is incubated in a test tube with a special kind of DNA polymerase, a supply of nucleotides, and short pieces of synthetic single-stranded DNA that serve as primers for DNA synthesis. (Recall from FIGURE 16.14 that DNA polymerases need primers because they can add nucleotides only to a preexisting nucleotide chain.) With automation, PCR can make billions of copies of a targeted segment of DNA in a few hours, significantly faster than the days it takes to clone a piece of DNA by making a recombinant plasmid and letting it replicate within bacteria. Amplifying a tiny DNA sample a billionfold does not produce much DNA, but it can be enough for some purposes, such as DNA fingerprinting for a murder trial.

Fig 20-7. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is a method for making many copies of a specific segment of DNA. It is much faster than gene cloning using a plasmid or phage vector and is performed completely in vitro. A PCR machine repeats the three-step cycle shown in this figure again and again, until the targeted sequence has been duplicated many times.

In the PCR procedure (see FIGURE 20.7), a three-step cycle brings about a chain reaction that produces an exponentially growing population of DNA molecules. The key to easy PCR automation is an unusual DNA polymerase that was first isolated from bacteria living in hot springs. Unlike most proteins, this enzyme can withstand the heat needed to separate the DNA strands at the start of each cycle.

Just as impressive as the speed of PCR is its specificity. By their complementarity to sequences bracketing the targeted sequence, the primers determine the DNA sequence that is amplified. (In fact, PCR requires knowledge of such sequences.) PCR can be used, for example, to amplify a specific gene prior to further cloning in cells. The PCR makes the gene by far the most abundant DNA fragment, thus simplifying the later task of finding a clone carrying that gene. In fact, PCR is so specific and powerful that its starting material does not even have to be purified DNA. Only minute amounts of DNA need be present in the starting material, and this DNA can be in a partially degraded state. Note, however, that PCR cannot substitute for gene cloning in cells when large amounts of a gene are desired. Occasional errors during PCR replication impose limits on the number of good copies that can be made by this method.

Devised in 1985, PCR has had a major impact on biological research and biotechnology. PCR has been used to amplify DNA from a wide variety of sources: fragments of ancient DNA from a 40,000-year-old frozen woolly mammoth; DNA from tiny amounts of blood, tissue, or semen found at the scenes of violent crimes; DNA from single embryonic cells for rapid prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders; and DNA of viral genes from cells infected with such difficult-to-detect viruses as HIV. We'll return to applications of PCR later in the chapter.





 Restriction fragment analysis detects DNA differences that affect restriction sites

Restriction fragment analysis indirectly detects certain differences in the nucleotide sequences of DNA molecules. In this method, we use gel electrophoresis to sort by size the DNA fragments that result from treating a long DNA molecule with a restriction enzyme. Just viewing the stained pattern of bands on the gel can provide scientifically useful information. When the mixture of restriction fragments from a particular DNA molecule undergoes electrophoresis, it yields a band pattern characteristic of the starting molecule and the restriction enzyme used. In fact, the relatively small DNA molecules of viruses and plasmids can be identified simply by their restriction fragment patterns. (Larger DNA molecules, such as those of eukaryotic chromosomes, yield too many fragments to appear as distinct bands.) Because DNA can be recovered undamaged from gels, the procedure also provides a way to prepare pure samples of individual fragments.

Let's use restriction fragment analysis to compare two different DNA molecules representing, for example, different alleles of a gene. We start by digesting each DNA sample with the same restriction enzyme. Because the two alleles must differ slightly in DNA sequence, they may differ in one or more restriction sites. Thus, the collections of restriction fragments from the two alleles may produce different band patterns in gel electrophoresis. FIGURE 20.9 (p. 384) shows how restriction fragment analysis by electrophoresis can distinguish between two alleles of a gene that differ in sequence by only one base pair if a restriction site is affected.

Fig 20-9. Using restriction fragment patterns to distinguish DNA from different alleles.

The starting materials in FIGURE 20.9 are samples of cloned and purified genes. However, by combining gel electrophoresis with nucleic acid hybridization, we can make the same comparison without preliminary gene cloning. We can start with DNA of the whole genome. Although electrophoresis will yield too many bands to distinguish individually, we can use nucleic acid hybridization with a specific probe to label discrete bands that derive from our gene of interest.

The principle is the same as for the nucleic acid hybridization in FIGURE 20.4: A radioactive single-stranded nucleic acid probe selectively hydrogen-bonds with a targeted, complementary DNA sequence, which is then detected by autoradiography. Now, however, we use a probe in combination with an additional technique called Southern hybridization or Southern blotting.FIGURE 20.10 outlines the entire procedure and demonstrates how it can be used to compare DNA samples from three individuals. This method goes beyond FIGURE 20.4 by revealing not only whether a particular sequence is present in a sample of DNA but also the restriction fragments that contain the sequence.

Fig 20-10. Restriction fragment analysis by Southern blotting. This procedure enables researchers to detect and analyze particular DNA sequences. The basis for detecting specific sequences is nucleic acid hybridization. The results can show not only whether certain sequences exist in different samples but also the number of such sequences within a genome and the size of the restriction fragments that contain them. In this way, it is possible to compare the DNA of different individuals or even species. Because of the selective power of nucleic acid hybridization, the starting material for analysis can be the entire genome of an organism. This huge length of DNA will produce so many restriction fragments that if all were made visible (with a dye, for example), they would appear as a smear in gel electrophoresis, rather than as discrete bands. Instead, only the DNA bands of interest are made visible by using a labeled probe. Before hybridization, the DNA being tested is transferred by capillary action (blotting) from the gel to a solid support, a sheet of nitrocellulose or nylon paper. The entire hybridization procedure is known as Southern blotting, after E.M. Southern, who developed it in 1975. The sensitivity of the hybridization can be adjusted either to detect only those sequences that are perfectly complementary to the probe or to detect similar (homologous) sequences as well.

Southern blotting proved invaluable when biologists turned their attention to noncoding DNA, which comprises most of the DNA of animal and plant genomes. Are there differences in noncoding DNA sequences analogous to the differences in alleles of genes? Using noncoding DNA in procedures like that of FIGURE 20.9, researchers were excited to discover many differences in band patterns. Differences in DNA sequence on homologous chromosomes that can result in different restriction fragment patterns turn out to be scattered abundantly throughout genomes, including the human genome. Such differences have been named restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs, pronounced "Riflips"). This type of difference is conceptually the same as a difference in coding sequence; it, too, can serve as a genetic marker for a particular location (locus) in the genome. A given RFLP marker frequently occurs in numerous variants in a population. (The word polymorphisms comes from the Greek for "many forms.")

RFLPs are detected and analyzed by Southern blotting. The example shown in FIGURE 20.10 could as easily represent the detection of a RFLP in noncoding DNA as a difference in the coding sequences of two alleles. Because of the sensitivity of DNA hybridization, the entire genome can be used as the DNA starting material. (Samples of human DNA are typically obtained from white blood cells.) The result of the procedure shown in FIGURE 20.10 indicates that individuals I and II carry the same version of the marker (RFLP or gene), but individual III carries a different version.

Because RFLP markers are inherited in a Mendelian fashion, they can serve as genetic markers for making linkage maps. The geneticist uses the same reasoning you saw applied in FIGURE 15.6: The frequency with which two RFLP markers--or a RFLP marker and a certain allele for a gene--are inherited together is a measure of the closeness of the two loci on a chromosome. The discovery of RFLPs greatly increased the number of markers available for mapping the human genome. No longer were geneticists limited to genetic variations that lead to obvious phenotypic differences (such as genetic diseases) or even to differences in protein products.





 Entire genomes can be mapped at the DNA level

As early as 1980, molecular biologist David Botstein and colleagues proposed that the DNA variations reflected in RFLPs could serve as the basis for an extremely detailed map of the entire human genome. Since then, researchers have in fact used such markers for mapping the genomes of a number of organisms. For some organisms, they have already succeeded in bringing the map to the ultimate level of detail: the entire sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. Along the way, they have taken advantage of all the tools and techniques discussed in this chapter--restriction enzymes, DNA cloning, gel electrophoresis, labeled probes, and so forth.

The most ambitious research project made possible by DNA technology has been the Human Genome Project, officially begun in 1990. This is an effort to map the entire human genome, ultimately by determining the complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA of each human chromosome (the 22 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes). As organized by an international, publicly funded consortium of 20 groups of researchers at universities and research institutes, the project has proceeded through three stages that focus on the DNA more and more closely: genetic (or linkage) mapping, physical mapping, and DNA sequencing. We'll describe these stages shortly.

In addition to mapping human DNA, the Human Genome Project includes mapping the genomes of other species important in biological research, including E. coli and other prokaryotes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), and Mus musculus (mouse). These genomes are of great interest in their own right and are also providing important insights of general biological significance, as we'll discuss later. In addition, the early work on these genomes was useful for developing the strategies, methods, and new technologies necessary for deciphering the human genome, which is much larger. The technological power for this daunting task has come in large part from advances in automation and from utilization of electronic technology, including computer software.

Genetic (Linkage) Mapping

In mapping a large genome, the first stage is to construct a linkage map of several thousand genetic markers spaced evenly throughout the chromosomes. As you learned in Chapter 15, the order of the markers on such a map and the relative distances between them are based on recombination frequencies. The markers can be genes (as in Chapter 15) or any other identifiable sequences in the DNA, such as RFLPs or the short repetitive sequences called microsatellites (see TABLE 19.1). Relying primarily on microsatellites, which are abundant in the human genome and have various "alleles" differing in length, researchers completed in a few years a human genetic map with some 5,000 markers. Such a map enables them to locate other markers, including genes, by testing for genetic linkage to the known markers. It is also valuable as a framework for organizing more detailed maps of particular regions.

Physical Mapping: Ordering DNA Fragments

In a physical map, the distances between markers are expressed in some physical measure, usually the number of nucleotides along the DNA. For whole-genome mapping, a physical map is made by cutting the DNA of each chromosome into a number of identifiable restriction fragments and then determining the original order of the fragments in the chromosomal DNA. The key is to make fragments that overlap and then use probes or automated nucleotide sequencing of the ends to find the overlaps. A method called chromosome walking, which uses probes, has been very useful (FIGURE 20.11).

Fig 20-11. Chromosome walking. The researcher starts with a known gene or other DNA segment--one that has already been cloned, mapped, and sequenced--&gt;and "walks" along the chromosomal DNA from that locus, producing a map of overlapping restriction fragments. To prepare the fragments, the scientist cuts two samples of chromosomal DNA with different restriction enzymes and then clones both sets of fragments to form two libraries. This and other methods of ordering DNA fragments involve determining the nucleotide sequences of short, unique segments within each fragment. The resulting physical map is thus a linear array of fragments, each identifiable by two or more sequenced regions. All the DNA in this diagram is shown as single strands.

Supplies of the DNA fragments used for physical mapping are prepared by cloning. In working with large genomes, researchers carry out several rounds of DNA cutting, cloning, and physical mapping. The first cloning vector is often a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), which can carry inserted fragments a million base pairs long, or a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), an artificial version of a bacterial chromosome that can carry inserts of 100,000 to 500,000 base pairs. The scientists determine the order of these long fragments (by chromosome walking, for instance) and then cut each fragment into smaller pieces, which are cloned and ordered in turn. The final sets of fragments, cloned in plasmids or phage, are only about 1,000 base pairs long, short enough to be sequenced easily.

DNA Sequencing

The complete nucleotide sequence of a genome is the ultimate map. To repeat a key point, it is the technology for cloning fragments of DNA that has made possible the sequencing of the very long DNA molecules of genomes. Starting with a pure preparation of many copies of a relatively short DNA fragment, the nucleotide sequence of the fragment can be determined by a sequencing machine (see the photograph opening this chapter). The usual sequencing technique, described in FIGURE 20.12 (p. 388), combines DNA labeling, DNA synthesis involving special chain-terminating nucleotides, and high-resolution gel electrophoresis. But even with automation, the sequencing of all 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs in a haploid set of human chromosomes is a formidable challenge. In fact, a major thrust of the Human Genome Project has been the development of technology for faster sequencing, along with more sophisticated computer software for analyzing and assembling the partial sequences.

Fig 20-12. Sequencing of DNA by the Sanger method. Developed by British scientist Frederick Sanger, this method for determining the nucleotide sequence of DNA molecules involves synthesizing in vitro DNA strands complementary to one of the strands of the DNA being sequenced. The method is based on the random incorporation of a modified nucleotide, a dideoxyribonucleotide, which terminates a growing DNA chain because it lacks a 3&#39;--OH for attachment of the next nucleotide (see FIGURE 16.11). DNA strands are synthesized that reflect all possible positions of the dideoxynucleotides and thus ultimately the entire DNA sequence. The molecules that are sequenced are cloned restriction fragments, typically several hundred nucleotides long. Most of the work of DNA sequencing is now automated. Instead of labeling the fragments with radioactive primers, modern sequencing machines use fluorescent dyes to tag the dideoxyribonucleotides, one color for each of the four types of nucleotide. This approach allows the four reactions to be performed in a single tube; the dideoxy ends of the reaction product DNA strands can be distinguished by the color of their fluorescence (see chapter-opening photo).

FIGURE 20.13a (p. 389) reviews the three-stage, hierarchical approach to genome mapping that we've discussed so far. In practice, the three stages have overlapped in a way that our simplified version does not portray, but they have remained the overarching strategy of the public consortium of researchers.

Alternative Approaches to Whole-Genome Sequencing

In 1992, emboldened by advances in sequencing machines and computer technology, molecular biologist J. Craig Venter came up with an alternative approach to the sequencing of whole genomes. His idea was essentially to skip the genetic mapping and physical mapping stages and start directly with the sequencing of random DNA fragments. Powerful computer programs would then assemble the resulting very large number of overlapping short sequences into a single continuous one (FIGURE 20.13b). Despite the skepticism of many other scientists, Venter left the public consortium to follow his vision. The worth of his approach was demonstrated in 1995, at least for prokaryotic genomes, when he and colleagues reported the first complete sequence of an organism, the bacterium Hemophilus influenzae. In May 1998, he set up a company, Celera Genomics, and promised a completed human sequence in three years. His whole-genome shotgun approach to sequencing was further validated in March 2000 by the sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, carried out in collaboration with academic scientists. As promised, in February 2001, Celera announced the sequencing of over 90%  of the human genome--simultaneously with a similar announcement by the public consortium.

Representatives of the public consortium have pointed out that Celera made heavy use of their maps and sequence data, which are all--unlike Celera's data--made immediately available for free use, and assert that the infrastructure established by their approach will greatly facilitate the finishing-up phase of the project. Venter, on the other hand, argues for the efficiency and economy of Celera's methods; and indeed, the public consortium has made some use of them. What is clear is that both approaches are valuable and that the competition between the two groups has hastened progress. (See FIGURE 20.13 to review the two strategies.)

As of mid-2001, the genomes of about 50 species have been completely (or almost completely) sequenced. Most are prokaryotes, including E. coli, a number of other bacteria (including ones of medical importance), and about 10 archaea. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the first eukaryote to be completed, and the nematode C. elegans, a simple worm, the first multicellular organism. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana, another important research organism, has also been completed. Finally, the human genome is well on its way to completion, although there are still many gaps in the sequence. Because of the presence of repetitive DNA and for other poorly understood reasons, certain parts of the chromosomes of multicellular organisms resist detailed mapping by the usual methods. However, as sequences for more organisms are assembled, the job gets easier. For example, the sequencing of the mouse genome, which is about 85%  identical to the human genome, is being greatly aided by what is now known of the human sequence.

On one level these sequences are simply dry lists of nucleotide bases--millions of A's, T's, C's, and G's in mind-numbing succession. But on another level, reached with the help of computer analysis, these sequences are already the basis of some exciting discoveries, which we discuss next.





 Genome sequences provide clues to important biological questions

Genomics, the study of genomes based on their DNA sequences, is yielding new insights into fundamental questions about genome organization, the control of gene expression, growth and development, and evolution. The beauty of DNA technology is that it enables geneticists to study genes directly, without having to infer genotype from phenotype as in classical genetics. But the newer approach poses the opposite problem, determining the phenotype from the genotype. Starting with a long DNA sequence, how does one recognize genes and determine their function?

Analyzing DNA Sequences

DNA sequences are being collected in computer data banks that are available to researchers all over the world via the Internet. Scientists use software to scan the sequences for the telltale signs of protein-coding genes, such as start and stop signals for transcription and translation (promoters, for example) and sequences associated with RNA-splicing sites. The software also looks for sequences similar to those found in known genes. (Thousands of such sequences, called expressed sequence tags, or ESTs, are cataloged in computer databases.) In this way, researchers come up with a list of gene candidates.

Surprisingly Few Genes in the Human Genome. The most surprising--and humbling--result to date from the Human Genome Project is the small number of putative genes. The estimated number, 30,000 to 40,000, is much lower than the 50,000 to 100,000 expected and only two to three times the number found in the fruit fly and nematode worm (TABLE 20.1). Relative to the other organisms studied so far, a much smaller fraction of human DNA is genes. Much of the enormous amount of noncoding DNA in the human genome is repetitive DNA, but unusually long introns also contribute significantly. Human introns are typically ten times longer than those of the fly or worm.

Table 20-1. Genome Sizes and Numbers of Genes

For one thing, compared with those of other organisms, our genome "gets more bang for the buck" out of its coding sequences because the RNA transcripts of human genes are more subject to alternative splicing (see FIGURE 19.11). The typical human gene probably specifies at least two or three different polypeptides by using different combinations of exons. This would bring the total number of different human polypeptides to about 90,000, without even beginning to consider the additional polypeptide diversity brought about by post-translational processing, such as cleavage or the addition of carbohydrate groups.

Furthermore, the human DNA sequence (as well as other kinds of data) suggests that our polypeptides tend to be more complicated than those of invertebrates. Recall that many polypeptides consist of more than one domain, which is a discrete section with a particular structure and function (for some examples, see FIGURE 19.10). Although humans do not seem to have more types of domains than invertebrates, the domains are put together in many more combinations.

In summary, the human genome seems to do more mixing and matching of modular elements--exons and protein domains--than simpler organisms, and this is undoubtedly a feature of vertebrates in general.

Studying and Comparing Genes. About half of the human genes were already known before the Human Genome Project, but what of the others? Scientists compare the sequences of new gene candidates with those of known genes from various organisms. In some cases, a newly determined gene sequence will match, at least partially, a gene whose function is well known. For example, part of a new gene may match a known gene that encodes a protein kinase, suggesting that the new gene does, too. In other cases, the new gene sequence will be similar to a sequence encountered before but of unknown function. In still other cases, the sequence may be entirely unlike anything ever seen before. In the organisms that have been sequenced so far, many of the gene candidate sequences are entirely new to science. For example, about a third of the genes of E. coli, the best-studied of research organisms, are new to us!

Despite the high complexity of the human genome and the proteins it encodes, comparisons of genome sequences confirm very strongly the evolutionary connections between even distantly related organisms and the relevance of research on simpler organisms to our understanding of human biology. Similarities between genes of disparate organisms can be surprising, to the point that one researcher has said that he now views fruit flies as "little people with wings." Yeast, for example, has a number of genes close enough to the human versions that they can substitute for them in a human cell. In fact, researchers can sometimes work out what a human disease gene does by studying its normal counterpart in yeast. Bacterial sequences reveal unsuspected metabolic pathways that may have industrial or medical uses. Moreover, comparisons of the completed genome sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya strongly support the theory that these are the three fundamental domains of life.

Studying Gene Expression

We study genomes not only to learn about individual genes and their evolution but to learn how genes act together to produce and maintain a functioning organism. A major part of the answer to how we get along with so few genes is likely to be unusually complex networks of interactions among genes and their products. While some scientists are laboring to sequence and analyze their structure, others are using the genome sequences already obtained to study patterns of gene expression from a new, global perspective. These researchers are asking which genes are transcribed in different situations. Their basic strategy is to isolate the mRNA made in particular cells, use these molecules as templates for making a cDNA library by reverse transcription, and then compare this cDNA with other collections of DNA by hybridization. Researchers can see what genes are active at different stages of development, in different tissues, or in tissues in different states of health.

DNA technology makes such gene expression studies possible; automation allows them to be easily performed on a large scale. Scientists can now detect and measure the expression of thousands of genes at one time. A revolutionary new method, described in FIGURE 20.14, uses DNA microarray assays. Tiny amounts of a large number of single-stranded DNA fragments representing different genes are fixed to a glass slide in a tightly spaced array (grid). (The array is also called a DNA chip by analogy to a computer chip.) Ideally, these fragments represent all the genes of an organism, as is already possible for organisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced. The fragments are tested for hybridization with various samples of cDNA molecules, which have been labeled with fluorescent dyes. An early test of this method compared the genes expressed in the roots and leaves of Arabidopsis. The researchers went on to sequence the genes that were more highly expressed in one tissue than in the other. The results were as predicted; genes encoding known photosynthetic enzymes, for instance, were turned on in the leaves but not in the roots. But more important than confirming predictions is the method's potential for uncovering new genes and gene interactions and providing clues to gene function. For example, DNA microarray assays are being used to compare cancerous with noncancerous tissues. Studying the differences in gene expression may lead researchers to new diagnostic techniques and biochemically targeted treatments, as well as a fuller understanding of cancer. Ultimately, information from microarray assays should provide us a grander view: how ensembles of genes interact to form a living organism.

Fig 20-14. DNA microarray assay for gene expression. With this method, a researcher can simultaneously test all the genes expressed in a particular tissue for hybridization with an array of short DNA sequences representing thousands of genes, even all the genes of the organism. The cDNA molecules made in part (a) step 2 and added to every well of the microarray in step 3 represent the genes that were active in the tissue. In step 4, the spots where any of the cDNA hybridizes fluoresce with an intensity indicating the relative amount of the mRNA that was in the tissue. Molecules of cDNA representing more than one tissue or the same kind of tissue under different conditions can be tested together by using a different colored label for each.

Determining Gene Function

Perhaps the most interesting genes discovered in genome sequencing and gene expression studies are those whose functions are completely mysterious. How do researchers discover the functions of these genes? The main idea is to disable the gene in some way and hope that the consequences in the cell or organism will provide clues to the gene's normal function. One powerful approach is in vitro mutagenesis, a technique that can be used to introduce specific changes into the sequence of a cloned gene. Such mutations can alter or destroy the function of the protein product. Then, when the mutated gene is returned to a cell, it may be possible to determine the function of the missing normal protein by examining the phenotype of the mutant. Researchers can even put such a mutated gene into cells from the early embryo of a multicelled organism (such as a mouse) to study the role of the gene in the development and functioning of the whole organism.

Some researchers working with nonmammalian organisms have recently begun using a simpler and faster method to silence the expression of selected genes. Called RNA interference (RNAi), the method uses synthetic double-stranded RNA molecules matching the sequence of a particular gene to trigger breakdown of the gene's messenger RNA. How the double-stranded RNA brings about this effect in the cell is still largely a mystery, but the process is a natural one that probably evolved to protect cells from viruses and restrain the movement of retrotransposons (which can disrupt essential genes). Scientists have only recently achieved some success in using the method to silence genes in mammalian cells, but in other kinds of organisms, such as the nematode, RNAi has already proved valuable.

Future Directions in Genomics

The success in mapping and sequencing genomes is encouraging scientists to move ahead to proteomics, the systematic study of the full protein sets (proteomes) encoded by genomes. Proteomics is a new kind of challenge. Because of alternative splicing of RNA and modifications of proteins after translation, the number of proteins in humans and our close relatives is likely to far exceed the number of genes. And collecting all the proteins will be difficult because a cell's proteins differ with the cell type and its state. Moreover, unlike DNA, proteins are extremely varied in structure and chemical and physical properties. However, because proteins are the molecules that actually carry out the activities of the cell, we must study them to learn how cells and organisms function. Ongoing technical advances, such as the recent development of protein micro-arrays for studying protein interactions, will be necessary to meet the challenge.

Genomics and proteomics are giving biologists an increasingly global perspective on the study of life. In an essay in Science, noted MIT biologists Eric Lander and Robert Weinberg predict that the availability of "complete parts lists of organisms"--that is, catalogs of genes and proteins--will change the discipline of biology dramatically:

The 21st century discipline will focus increasingly on the study of entire biological systems, by attempting to understand how component parts collaborate to create a whole. For the first time in a century, reductionists [are yielding] ground to those trying to gain a holistic view of cells and tissues.*

Advances in bioinformatics, the application of computer science and mathematics to genetic and other biological information, will play a crucial role in dealing with the enormous masses of data involved.

As Landers and Weinberg point out elsewhere in their essay, we are now poised to understand the spectrum of genetic variation in humans. Because the history of the human species is so short--we are probably all descended from a small population living in Africa 150,000 to 200,000 years ago--the amount of DNA variation in humans is small compared to that of other species. Most of our diversity seems to be in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced "snips"), which are single base-pair variations in the genome.*

In the human genome, SNPs occur on average about once in 1,000 base pairs. In other words, if you could compare your personal DNA sequence with that of the person sitting next to you--or with that of someone on the other side of the world--you would find them to be 99.9%  identical.

Scientists are already well on their way to identifying the locations of the 3 million or so SNP sites in the human genome. These will be useful genetic markers for studying human evolution, the differences between human populations, and the migratory routes that led from Africa to the other continents. They will also be valuable markers for identifying disease genes and genes that affect our health in more subtle ways by influencing susceptibility to certain diseases or sensitivities to environmental toxins or drugs. This is likely to change the practice of medicine later in the 21st century. However, applications of DNA research and technology are already affecting our lives in many ways. We devote the rest of the Chapter to a discussion of some of these applications and related issues.





 DNA technology is reshaping medicine and the pharmaceutical industry

Modern biotechnology is making enormous contributions to medicine, both in the diagnosis of diseases and in the develop ment of pharmaceutical products. One obvious benefit of DNA technology and of the Human Genome Project is the identification of genes whose mutation is responsible for genetic diseases, for these discoveries could lead to ways of diagnosing, treating, and perhaps even preventing those conditions.

Equally important are the potential benefits of DNA technology for dealing with other kinds of diseases, from arthritis to AIDS. Susceptibility to many "nongenetic" diseases is influenced by a person's genes. Furthermore, diseases of all sorts involve changes in gene expression within the affected cells and often within the patient's immune system. By using DNA micro-array assays or other techniques to compare gene expression in healthy and diseased tissues, researchers hope to find many of the genes that are turned on or off in particular diseases. These genes and their products are potential targets for prevention or therapy.

Diagnosis of Diseases

A new Chapter in the diagnosis of infectious diseases has been opened by DNA technology, in particular the use of PCR and labeled nucleic acid probes to track down certain pathogens. For example, because the sequence of HIV DNA is known, PCR can be used to amplify, and thus detect, HIV DNA in blood or tissue samples. This is often the best way to detect an otherwise elusive infection.

Medical scientists can now diagnose hundreds of human genetic disorders using DNA technology. Increasingly, they can identify individuals with genetic diseases before the onset of symptoms, even before birth. It is also possible to identify symptomless carriers of potentially harmful recessive alleles. Genes have been cloned for many human diseases, including hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Hybridization analysis makes it possible to detect abnormal allelic forms of genes present in DNA samples. Even in cases where the gene has not yet been cloned, the presence of an abnormal allele can be diagnosed with reasonable accuracy if a closely linked RFLP marker has been found (FIGURE 20.15). Alleles for Huntington's disease and a number of other genetic diseases were first detected in this indirect way. The underlying principle is that the closeness of the marker to the gene itself makes it very unlikely that crossing over will occur between the marker and the gene during gamete formation; therefore, the marker and gene will almost always stay together in inheritance. (The same principle obviously applies to all kinds of markers, including the SNPs that may soon come into diagnostic use.) Once a gene is mapped precisely, it can be cloned for study and for use as a probe for finding identical or similar DNA, as is now the case for Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and many other diseases.

Fig 20-15. RFLP markers close to a gene. Even if a disease-causing allele has not been cloned and its precise locus is unknown, its presence can sometimes be detected with high (though not perfect) accuracy by testing for the presence of RFLP markers that are very close to the gene in question. This diagram depicts homologous segments of DNA from a family in which some members have a genetic disease. In this family, different versions of a RFLP marker are associated with the different alleles, allowing the test to be applied. If a family member has inherited the version of the RFLP marker with two restriction sites (rather than one), there is a high probability that the individual has also inherited the disease-causing allele.

Human Gene Therapy

Techniques for gene manipulating DNA hold great potential for treating a variety of diseases by gene therapy--the alteration of an afflicted individual's genes. In people with disorders traceable to a single defective gene, it should theoretically be possible to replace or supplement the defective gene with a normal allele. The new allele could be inserted into the somatic cells of the tissue affected by the disorder.

For gene therapy of somatic cells to be permanent, the cells that receive the normal allele must be ones that multiply throughout the patient's life. Bone marrow cells, which include the stem cells that give rise to all the cells of the blood and immune system, are prime candidates. FIGURE 20.16 outlines one possible procedure for a situation in which bone marrow cells are failing to produce a vital enzyme because of a single defective gene. Some bone marrow cells are removed from the patient, the normal allele inserted by a viral vector, and the modified cells returned to the patient. If the procedure succeeds, the cells will multiply throughout the patient's life and express the normal gene. The engineered cells will supply the missing protein, and the patient will be cured.

Fig 20-16. One type of gene therapy procedure. A retrovirus vector that has been rendered harmless is used to introduce a normal allele of a gene into the cells of a patient who lacks it. The method takes advantage of the fact that a retrovirus inserts a DNA transcript of its RNA genome into the chromosomal DNA of its host cell (see FIGURE 18.7). If the viral nucleic acid includes a foreign gene and that gene is expressed, the cell and its descendants will possess the gene product and may be cured. Cells that reproduce throughout life, such as bone marrow cells, are ideal candidates for gene therapy.

But despite "hype" in the news media over the past decade, there has been very little scientifically strong evidence of effective gene therapy reported. Even when genes are successfully and safely transferred and are being expressed in their new host, their activity typically diminishes after a short period.

For this reason and because of concerns about safety, most of the current gene therapy trials now under way in humans are not aimed at correcting genetic defects. Instead, researchers are looking for ways to use gene therapy in the fight against major killers such as heart disease and cancer. The most promising trials are those in which a very limited period of activity by the transferred genes is not only sufficient but desirable. For example, one idea is to help treat coronary artery disease by introducing into the heart muscle a gene encoding a growth factor that stimulates new blood vessels to grow around blocked arteries. After success with pigs, two groups of researchers are now carrying out preliminary trials designed to assess safety in humans. One group is using the same vector used in the pig studies: an adenovirus (a major cause of the common cold) modified so it cannot cause disease; the other group is injecting the naked growth factor gene directly into the muscle. The viral vectors are rapidly destroyed by the immune system, and the direct injection method is very inefficient. But the goal is simply to get the heart cells to produce enough growth factor to trigger a brief period of blood vessel growth. Preliminary results are encouraging.

Many technical questions are posed by gene therapy. For example, how can the activity of the transferred gene be controlled so that cells make appropriate amounts of the gene product at the right time and in the right place? How can we be sure that the insertion of the therapeutic gene does not harm some other necessary cell function? Information about DNA control elements from genome sequencing and large-scale gene expression studies that teach us about gene interactions may help answer such questions.

Gene therapy raises some difficult ethical and social questions. Some critics suggest that tampering with human genes in any way, even in somatic cells and even to treat individuals who have life-threatening diseases, is wrong. They argue that it will inevitably lead to the practice of eugenics, a deliberate effort to control the genetic makeup of human populations. Other observers see no fundamental difference between genetic engineering of somatic cells and other conventional medical interventions to save lives. They compare the transplantion of genes to the transplantation of organs.

The most difficult ethical question is whether we should try to treat human germ-line cells in the hope of correcting the defect in future generations. In laboratory mice at least, transferring foreign genes into the germ line (egg cells) is now a routine procedure. Thus, despite the challenges, it is clear that the technical problems relating to similar genetic engineering in humans will eventually be solved. We will then have to face the question of whether it is advisable, under any circumstances, to alter the genomes of human germ lines or embryos. Should we interfere with evolution in this way? From a biological perspective, the elimination of unwanted alleles from the gene pool could backfire. Genetic variety is a necessary ingredient for the survival of a species as environmental conditions change with time. Genes that are damaging under some conditions may be advantageous under other conditions (one example is the sickle-cell allele, discussed in Chapter 14). Are we willing to risk making genetic changes that could be detrimental to our species in the future? We may have to face this question soon.

Pharmaceutical Products

DNA technology has been used to create many useful pharmaceutical products, mostly proteins. By transferring the gene for a desired protein product into a bacterium, yeast, or other kind of cell that is easy to grow in culture, one can produce large quantities of proteins that are present naturally in only minute amounts.

Using DNA technology to put highly active promoters (and other gene control elements) into vector DNA, scientists create expression vectors that enable the host cell to make large amounts of the product of a gene inserted into the vector. In addition, host cells can be engineered to secrete a protein as it is made, thereby simplifying the task of purifying it by traditional biochemical methods.

One of the first practical applications of gene splicing was the production of mammalian hormones and other mammalian regulatory proteins in bacteria. Human insulin and human growth hormone (HGH) were among the earliest examples. The insulin produced in this way has greatly benefited the 2 million diabetics in the United States who depend on insulin treatment to control their disease; previously they had to rely on insulin from pigs and cattle, which is not identical to human insulin. Human growth hormone has been a boon to children born with hypopituitarism, a form of dwarfism caused by inadequate amounts of HGH, and may prove to have other uses, such as the healing of injuries.

Another important pharmaceutical product produced by genetic engineering is tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). This protein helps dissolve blood clots and reduces the risk of subsequent heart attacks if administered very shortly after an initial attack. However, TPA illustrates a problem with many genetically engineered products: Because the development costs were high and the market is relatively limited, it is expensive.

The most recent developments in pharmaceutical products involve truly novel ways to fight certain diseases that do not respond to traditional drug treatments. One approach is the use of genetically engineered proteins that either block or mimic surface receptors on cell membranes. One such experimental drug mimics a receptor protein that HIV binds to in entering white blood cells. The HIV binds to the drug molecules instead and fails to enter the blood cells.

For many viral diseases for which there are no effective drug treatments, prevention by vaccination is virtually the only way to fight the disease. A vaccine is a harmless variant or derivative of a pathogen that stimulates the immune system to fight the pathogen. Traditional vaccines for viral diseases are of two types: particles of a virulent virus that have been inactivated by chemical or physical means, and active virus particles of an attenuated (nonpathogenic) viral strain. In both cases, the virus particles are similar enough to the active pathogen to trigger an immune response (see Chapter 43).

Recombinant DNA techniques can generate large amounts of a specific protein molecule normally found on the surface of a pathogen. If the protein, referred to as a subunit, is one that triggers an immune response against the intact pathogen, then it can be used as a vaccine. Alternatively, genetic engineering methods can be used to modify the genome of the pathogen to attenuate it. A vaccine consisting of an attenuated microbe is often more effective than a subunit vaccine because it usually triggers a greater response by the immune system. Pathogens attenuated by gene-splicing techniques may be safer than the natural mutants traditionally used.

A completely new development in the use of recombinant DNA technology by the pharmaceutical industry is the genetic modification of plants to produce vaccines and rare human proteins of medical importancee. We'll discuss this application, often called "pharming," in the next section.





 DNA technology offers forensic, environmental, and agricultural applications

Forensic Uses of DNA Technology

In violent crimes, blood or small amounts of other tissue may be left at the scene or on the clothes or other possessions of the victim or assailant. If rape is involved, small amounts of semen may be recovered from the victim's body. If enough tissue or semen is available, forensic laboratories can determine the blood type or tissue type by using antibodies to test for specific cell surface proteins. However, such tests require fairly fresh tissue in relatively large amounts. Also, because there are many people in the population with the same blood or tissue type, this approach can only exclude a suspect; it cannot provide strong evidence of guilt.

DNA testing, on the other hand, can identify the guilty individual with a much higher degree of certainty, because the DNA sequence of every person is unique (except for identical twins). RFLP analysis by Southern blotting is a powerful method for the forensic detection of similarities and differences in DNA samples and requires only tiny amounts of blood or other tissue (about 1,000 cells). In a murder case, for example, this method can be used to compare DNA samples from the suspect, the victim, and a small amount of blood found at the crime scene. Radioactive probes mark the electrophoresis bands that contain certain RFLP markers. The forensic scientist usually tests for about five markers; in other words, only a few selected portions of the DNA are tested. However, even such a small set of markers from an individual can provide a DNA fingerprint, or specific pattern of bands, that is of forensic use, because the probability that two people (who are not identical twins) would have the exact same set of RFLP markers is very small. The autoradiograph in FIGURE 20.17 resembles the type of evidence presented (with explanation) to juries in murder trials.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 20-17. DNA fingerprints from a murder case. As revealed by RFLP analysis, DNA from bloodstains on the defendant's clothes matches the DNA fingerprint of the victim but differs from the DNA fingerprint of the defendant. This is evidence that the blood on the defendant's clothes came from the victim, not the defendant. Ten different RFLP markers appear at different positions on this one "autorad" (autoradiograph). It is now more common to make separate autorads for each marker tested. The DNA bands resulting from electrophoresis are exposed to various probes in succession, with the previous probe washed off before the next one is applied.

The forensic use of DNA fingerprinting extends beyond violent crimes, For instance, comparing the DNA of a mother, her child, and the purported father can conclusively settle a question of paternity. Sometimes paternity is of historical interest: Recently, DNA fingerprinting provided strong evidence that Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one of the children of his slave Sally Hemings.

Today, instead of RFLPs, variations in the lengths of satellite DNA are increasingly used as markers for DNA fingerprinting. Recall from Chapter 19 that satellite DNA consists of tandemly repeated base sequences within the genome. The most useful satellite sequences for forensic purposes are microsatellites, which are roughly 10 to 100 base pairs long, have repeating units of only a few base pairs, and are highly variable from person to person. For example, one individual may have the unit ACA repeated 65 times at one genome locus, 118 times at a second locus, and so on, whereas another individual is likely to have different numbers of repeats at these loci. Such polymorphic genetic loci are usually called simple tandem repeats (STRs). Restriction fragments containing STRs vary in size among individuals because of differences in STR lengths, rather than because of different numbers of restriction sites within that region of the genome, as in RFLP analysis. The greater the number of markers examined in a DNA sample, the more likely it is that the DNA fingerprint is unique to one individual. PCR is often used to selectively amplify particular STRs or other markers before electrophoresis. Because of its selective power, PCR is especially valuable when the DNA is in poor condition or available only in minute quantities. A tissue sample as small as 20 cells can be sufficient for PCR.

Just how reliable is DNA fingerprinting? The DNA fingerprint of an individual would be truly unique if it were feasible to perform restriction fragment analysis on the person's entire genome. In practice, as already mentioned, forensic DNA tests focus on only about five tiny regions of the genome. However, the DNA regions chosen are ones known to be highly variable from one person to another. In most forensic cases, the probability of two people having identical DNA fingerprints is between one chance in 100,000 and one in a billion. The exact figure depends on the number of markers compared and on the frequency of those markers in the population. Information on how common various markers are in different ethnic groups is key because these marker frequencies may be very different from frequencies in the population as a whole. Such data now enable forensic scientists to make extremely accurate statistical calculations. Thus, despite problems that can still arise from insufficient statistical data, human error, or flawed evidence, DNA fingerprints are now accepted as compelling evidence by legal experts and scientists alike. Many argue that DNA evidence is more reliable than eyewitnesses in placing a suspect at the scene of a crime.

Environmental Uses of DNA Technology

Increasingly, genetic engineering is being applied to environmental work. The ability of microorganisms to transform chemicals is remarkable, and scientists are now engineering these metabolic capabilities into organisms that will help cope with some environmental problems. For example, many bacteria can extract heavy metals, such as copper, lead, and nickel, from their environments and incorporate the metals into compounds such as copper sulfate or lead sulfate, which are readily recoverable. Genetically engineered microbes may become important in both mining minerals (especially as ore reserves are depleted) and cleaning up highly toxic mining wastes.

The metabolic diversity of microbes is also employed in dealing with wastes from other sources. Sewage treatment plants rely on the ability of microbes to degrade many organic compounds into nontoxic form. However, an increasing number of potentially harmful compounds being released into the environment are not readily degraded by naturally occurring microbes; chlorinated hydrocarbons are a prime example. Biotechnologists are trying to engineer microbes to degrade these compounds. These microbes could be used in wastewater treatment plants or by manufacturers before the compounds are ever released into the environment.

A related research area is the identification and engineering of microbes capable of detoxifying specific toxic wastes found in spills and waste dumps. For example, bacterial strains have been developed that can degrade some of the compounds released during oil spills. The ability to move the genes responsible for these transformations into different organisms allows the development of strains that can survive the harsh conditions of these environmental disasters and still help detoxify the wastes.

Agricultural Uses of DNA Technology

Scientists are working to learn more about the genomes of agriculturally important plants and animals, and for a number of years they have been using DNA technology to try to improve agricultural productivity.

Animal Husbandry and "Pharm" Animals. DNA technology is now routinely used to make vaccines and growth hormones for treating farm animals and, on a still largely experimental ba sis, to make transgenic organisms, whose genomes carry genes from another species. The goals of creating a transgenic animal are often the same as the goals of traditional breeding--for instance, to make a sheep with better quality wool, a pig with leaner meat, or a cow that will mature in a shorter time. Scientists might, for example, identify and clone a gene that causes the development of larger muscles (muscles make up most of the meat we eat) in one variety of cattle and transfer it to other cattle or even to sheep.

Another type of transgenic animal is one engineered to be a pharmaceutical "factory"--a producer of a large amount of an otherwise rare biological substance for medical use (FIGURE 20.18). In most cases to date, a gene for a desired human protein, such as a hormone or blood-clotting factor, has been added to the genome of a farm mammal in such a way that the gene's product is secreted in the animal's milk. It can then be purified, usually more easily than from a cell culture or a transgenic plant.

Fig 20-18. Pharm" animals. These transgenic sheep carry a gene for a human blood protein, which they secrete in their milk. This protein inhibits an enzyme that contributes to lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis and some other chronic respiratory diseases. Easily purified from the sheep's milk, the protein is currently being tested as a treatment for cystic fibrosis.

Human proteins produced by farm animals may or may not be structurally identical to the natural human protein, so they have to be tested very carefully to make sure they will not cause allergic reactions or other adverse effects in patients receiving them. Also, the health and welfare of farm animals carrying genes from humans and other foreign species are important issues; problems such as low fertility or increased susceptibilty to disease are not uncommon.

How is a transgenic animal created? Scientists first remove egg cells from a female and fertilize them in vitro. Meanwhile, they clone the desired gene from another organism. They then inject the cloned DNA directly into the nuclei of the eggs. Some of the cells integrate the foreign DNA into their genomes and are able to express the foreign gene. The engineered eggs are then surgically implanted in a surrogate mother. If an embryo develops successfully, the result is a transgenic animal, containing a gene from a third "parent" that may even be of another species.

Genetic Engineering in Plants. Agricultural scientists have already provided a number of crop plants with genes for desirable traits, such as delayed ripening and resistance to spoilage and disease. In one striking way, plants are easier to engineer than most animals. For many plant species, a single tissue cell grown in culture can give rise to an adult plant (see FIGURE 21.5). Thus, genetic manipulations can be performed on a single cell and the cell then used to generate an organism with new traits.

The vector used to introduce new genes into plant cells is most often a plasmid from the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This is the Ti plasmid, so called because in nature it induces tumors (called crown galls) in plants infected by the bacterium. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. For vector purposes, researchers work with a version of the plasmid that does not cause disease.

Foreign genes can be inserted into the Ti plasmid using recombinant DNA techniques. The recombinant plasmid is either put back into Agrobacterium, which can then be used to infect plant cells growing in culture, or introduced directly into plant cells, where it inserts itself into the plant's chromosomes. Then, taking advantage of the capacity of those cells to regenerate whole plants, it is possible to produce plants that contain and express the foreign gene and pass it on to their offspring (FIGURE 20.19).

Fig 20-19. Using the Ti plasmid as a vector for genetic engineering in plants.

A major drawback to using the Ti plasmid as a vector is that only dicots (plants with two seed leaves) are susceptible to infection by Agrobacterium. Monocots, including agriculturally important grasses such as corn and wheat, cannot be infected by Agrobacterium. Fortunately, scientists can use newer techniques, such as electroporation and DNA guns (see FIGURE 38.17), to get DNA into the cells of these plants.

Genetic engineering is quickly replacing traditional plant-breeding programs, especially in cases where useful traits are determined by one or only a few genes. In the past few years, roughly half of the American crops of soybeans and corn have been grown from genetically modified seed. Many of the transgenic plants now being grown have received genes for herbicide resistance. For example, the development of cotton plants that carry a bacterial gene that makes the plants resis-tant to weed-killing herbicides have made it easier to grow crops while still ensuring that weeds are destroyed. In addition, a number of crop plants are being engineered to resist infectious microbes and pest insects. Growing insect-resistant plants reduces the use of chemical insecticides.

Scientists are also using gene transfer to improve the nutritional value of crop plants. One exciting recent advance has been the development of a transgenic rice plant that produces yellow rice grains containing beta-carotene, which our body uses to make vitamin A (FIGURE 20.20). This rice could help prevent vitamin A deficiency in the half of the world's population that depend on rice as a staple food. Vitamin A deficiency is a common problem. Currently, 70%  of children under the age of 5 in Southeast Asia suffer from this condition, which leads to vision impairment and increases susceptibility to disease.

Fig 20-20. "Golden" rice contrasted with ordinary rice. Beta-carotene in the golden rice kernels in this photograph is responsible for both their color and their increased nutritional value. The genes that give the plant its ability to make this vitamin inside its kernels come from daffodils and a bacterium. The vector was the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium fascians.(b) Enlarged photo of a microarray representing 2,400 human genes

An important potential use of DNA technology in improving the nutrition of the world's population involves nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas, which plants cannot use, to nitrogen compounds that plants can convert to essential nitrogen-containing molecules, such as amino acids. In nature, nitrogen fixation is performed by certain bacteria that live in the soil or in plant roots. Even so, the level of nitrogen compounds in the soil is often so low that fertilizers must be applied for crops to grow. Nitrogen providing fertilizers are costly and contribute to water pollution. DNA technology offers ways to increase bacterial nitrogen fixation and eventually, perhaps, to engineer crop plants to fix nitrogen themselves.

Finally, we arrive at the surprising new alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and agriculture mentioned earlier. The pharmaceutical industry has long made use of plants as sources of drugs. Now, however, DNA technology has made it possible to create plants that produce human proteins for medical use and viral proteins for use as vaccines. Several such "pharm" products are now being tested in clinical trials, including vaccines for hepatitis B and an antibody produced in transgenic tobacco plants that blocks the bacteria that cause tooth decay. Large amounts of these proteins might be made more economically by plants than by cultured cells.





 DNA technology raises important safety and ethical questions

As soon as scientists realized the power of DNA technology, they began to worry about potential dangers. Early concerns focused on the possibility that recombinant DNA technology might create hazardous new pathogens. What might happen, for instance, if cancer cell genes were transferred into bacteria or viruses? Scientists developed a set of guidelines that in the United States and some other countries have become formal government regulations.

One type of safety measure is a set of strict laboratory procedures designed to protect researchers from infection by engineered microbes and to prevent the microbes from accidentally leaving the laboratory. In addition, strains of micro-organisms to be used in recombinant DNA experiments are genetically crippled to ensure that they cannot survive outside the laboratory. Finally, certain obviously dangerous experiments have been banned. Today, most public concern about possible hazards centers not on recombinant microbes but on genetically modified (GM) organisms used in agriculture. In common parlance, a "GM organism" is one that has acquired one or more genes by artificial means; the gene need not be from another species.

Animals that have been genetically modified by artificial means are still not part of our food supply, but GM crop plants are. In 1999, controversy about the safety of these foods exploded in the United Kingdom--where one of the more extreme headlines warned of "the mad forces of genetic darkness"--and soon spread through Europe. In response to these concerns, the European Union suspended the introduction of new GM crops pending new legislation and started considering the possibility of banning the import of all GM foodstuffs. In the United States and other countries where the GM revolution had been proceeding more quietly, the labeling of GM foods as such is now being debated.

Early in 2000, negotiators from 130 countries (including the United States) agreed on a Biosafety Protocol that requires exporters to identify GM organisms present in bulk food shipments and allows importing countries to decide whether they pose environmental or health risks. This agreement has been hailed as a breakthrough by environmentalists.

Advocates of a cautious approach fear that crops carrying genes from other species might somehow be hazardous to human health or cause ecological harm to the environment. A major concern is that transgenic plants might pass their new genes to close relatives in nearby wild areas. We know that lawn and crop grasses, for example, commonly exchange genes with wild relatives via pollen transfer. If domestic plants carrying genes for resistance to herbicides, diseases, or insect pests pollinated wild ones, the offspring might become "super-weeds" very difficult to control. However, researchers may be able to prevent the escape of such plant genes by engineering plants so that they cannot hybridize. In April 2000, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released a study finding no scientific evidence that crops genetically modified to resist pests pose any special health or environmental risks, but the authors of the study also recommended more stringent regulations than now exist. To date, there is little good data on either side; more study is needed.

Today, governments and regulatory agencies throughout the world are grappling with how to facilitate the use of biotechnology in argiculture, industry, and medicine while ensuring that new products and procedures are safe. In the United States, all projects are evaluated for potential risks by various regulatory agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Agriculture. These agencies are under increasing pressure from some consumer groups. Meanwhile, these same agencies must consider some of the ethical questions revised by the new biotechnology.

As with all new technologies, developments in DNA technology have ethical overtones. Obtaining a complete map of the human genome, for example, opens the door to significant ethical questions. Who should have the right to examine someone else's genes? How should that information be used? Should a person's genome be a factor in suitability for a job or eligibility for insurance? Ethical considerations, as well as concerns about potential environmental and health hazards, will likely slow the application of the products of the new biotechnology. There is always a danger that too much regulation will stifle basic research and its potential benefits. However, the power of DNA technology and genetic engineering--our ability to profoundly and rapidly alter species that have been evolving for millennia--demands that we proceed with humility and caution.

This chapter applies much of what you've learned about molecules, cells, and genes to one of biology's most important questions--how a complex multicellular organism develops from a single cell. The application of genetic analysis and DNA technology to the study of development has brought about a revolution in the field. In much the same way that researchers have used mutations to deduce pathways of cellular metabolism, they now use mutations to dissect developmental pathways. In one striking example, Swiss researchers demonstrated in 1995 that a particular gene functions as a master switch that triggers the development of the eye inDrosophila.The scanning electron micrograph on this page shows the head of an abnormal fly with small extra eyes on its antennae. Expression of the master gene for eye development in an abnormal location in the fly caused the extra eyes. A similar gene triggers eye development in mice and other mammals. In fact, developmental biologists are discovering remarkable similarities in the mechanisms that shape diverse organisms.

The scientific study of development got under way about a century ago, around the same time as genetics. But for decades the two disciplines proceeded along mostly separate paths. We have seen how geneticists advanced from Mendel's laws to an understanding of the molecular basis of inheritance. Meanwhile, developmental biologists focused on embryology, the study of the stages of development leading from fertilized egg to fully formed organism. Only in recent years have the concepts and tools of molecular genetics reached the point where a real synthesis has been possible. The synthesis is a challenge, for it means relating the linear information in genes to a process of development that takes place in four dimensions, three of space and one of time.

This chapter introduces some of the basic genetic and cellular mechanisms that control development. It focuses on principles that apply to both animals and plants, with emphasis on two invertebrate animals: the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterand the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.In later chapters, you will learn much more about the development of plants (Chapter 35) and animals (Chapter 47).

A capstone to the genetics unit, this chapter also serves as a bridge to the rest of the book, for understanding development is crucial to understanding the evolution, diversity, structure, function, and ecology of organisms.





FROM SINGLE CELL TO MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM

 

 Embryonic development involves cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis



 

 Researchers study development in model organisms to identify general principles



In the development of most multicellular organisms, a single-celled zygote (fertilized egg) gives rise to cells of many different types, each type with a different structure and corresponding function. For example, an animal will have muscle cells that enable it to move and nerve cells that transmit signals to the muscle cells; a plant will have mesophyll cells that carry out photosynthesis and stomatal cells that regulate the passage of gases into and out of leaves (seeFIGURE 10.2). As you know, cells are only one level in the hierarchy of biological order within a multicellular organism (seeFIGURE 2.1). Cells of similar types are organized into tissues, tissues into organs, organs into organ systems, and organ systems into the whole organism. Thus, the process of embryonic development must give rise not only to cells of different types but to higher-level structures arranged in a particular way in three dimensions.





DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION

 

 Different types of cells in an organism have the same DNA



 

 Different cell types make different proteins, usually as a result of transcriptional regulation



 

 Transcriptional regulation is directed by maternal molecules in the cytoplasm and signals from other cells



We have stated on several previous occasions that differences between cells in a multicellular organism come almost entirely from differences in geneexpression, not from differences in the cells' genomes. (There are a few exceptions, such as antibody-producing cells; seeFIGURE 19.6) Furthermore, we have mentioned that these differences arise during development, as regulatory mechanisms turn specific genes on and off. Let's now look at some of the evidence for this assertion.

 Plant development depends on cell signaling and transcriptional regulation



How do cytoplasmic determinants, inductive signals, and their effects on embryonic cells contribute to morphogenesis, the shaping of the organism and its parts? We'll explore this question in the context ofpattern formation,the development of aspatial organizationin which the tissues and organs of an organism are all in their characteristic places. In the life of a plant, pattern formation occurs continually, in the apical meristems (seeFIGURE 21.2b). In animals, pattern formation is mostly limited to embryos and juveniles.

Pattern formation in animals begins in the early embryo, when the animal's basic body plan--its overall three-dimensional arrangement--is established. Just as the outline of a building is laid out before construction begins, the major axes of an animal are established very early. Before specialized tissues or organs appear, the relative positions of the animal's head and tail, for example, are established. The molecular cues that control pattern formation, collectively calledpositional information,tell a cell its location relative to the body axes and to neighboring cells and determine how the cell and its progeny will respond to future molecular signals.





 Embryonic development involves cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis

An organism arises from a fertilized egg cell as the result of three interrelated processes: cell division, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis (FIGURE 21.1). Through a succession of mitotic divisions, the zygote gives rise to a large number of cells. Cell division alone, however, would produce only a great ball of identical cells, nothing like an animal or plant. During embryonic development, cells not only increase in number, but also undergodifferentiation,becoming specialized in structure and function. Moreover, the different kinds of cells aren't just mixed up randomly but are organized into tissues and organs. The physical processes that give an organism its shape constitutemorphogenesis,meaning "creation of form."

Fig 21-1. From fertilized egg to animal: what a difference a week makes.It took just one week for cell division, differentiation, and morphogenesis to transform this fertilized frog egg(a)into a hatching tadpole(b).

The processes of cell division, differentiation, and morphogenesis overlap in time. Early events of morphogenesis lay out the basic body plan very early in embryonic development, establishing, for example, which end of an animal embryo will be the head or which end of a plant embryo will become the roots. Cell division and differentiation play important roles in morphogenesis in all organisms, as does the programmed death of certain cells. However, the overall schemes of morphogenesis in animals and plants are very different, and the mechanisms differ in two major ways (FIGURE 21.2, p. 404). First, in animals, but not in plants,movementsof cells and tissues are necessary to transform the early embryo into the characteristic three-dimensional form of the organism. We will discuss these morphogenetic movements in Chapter 47. The second major difference is that in plants, morphogenesis and growth in overall size are not limited to embryonic and juvenile periods but occur throughout the life of the plant.Apical meristems,which are perpetually embryonic regions in the tips of shoots and roots, are responsible for the plant's continual growth and formation of new organs, such as leaves and roots. In animals, ongoing development in adults is restricted to the differentiation of cells, such as blood cells, that must be continually replenished throughout the animal's lifetime.

Fig 21-2. Some key stages of development in animals and plants.Cell division, morphogenesis, and cell differentiation occur in both animal development and plant development.(a)Most animals go through some variation of the blastula and gastrula stages shown here in simplified form. The blastula is a sphere of cells surrounding a fluid-filled cavity. In forming the gastrula, a region of the blastula folds inward, forming a rudimentary gut cavity. The movement of cells and tissues plays an important role in animal morphogenesis. Biochemical events that will lead to cellular differentiation actually start before the gastrula forms. Once the animal is mature, differentiation occurs in only a limited way--for the replacement of damaged or lost cells.(b)In plants with seeds, a complete embryo develops within the seed. Morphogenesis, which does not involve cell or tissue movement, occurs throughout the plant's lifetime. Apical meristems (yellow) continuously arise and develop into the various plant organs as the plant grows to an indeterminate size.

The importance of precise regulation of morphogenesis is evident in human disorders that result from morphogenesis gone awry. For example, cleft palate, in which the upper wall of the mouth cavity fails to close completely, is a defect of morphogenesis.

As humans, we may naturally be most interested in developmental processes in our own species. However, many aspects of development are much easier to study in other kinds of organisms.





 Researchers study development in model organisms to identify general principles

Much of the early research on animal development focused on animals that lay their eggs in water, with amphibians, such as frogs, getting particular attention. Frogs have large eggs (2-3 mm in diameter) that are easy to observe and manipulate, and fertilization and development occur outside the mother's body. By studying these animals and others, biologists were able to work out a description of animal development at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, making a number of important discoveries in the process (see Chapter 47). Research on a variety of plants led to a basic understanding of plant development (see Chapter 35). When the primary research goal is to understand broad biological principles--of animal or plant development in this case--the organism chosen for study is called amodel organism.Researchers select model organisms that lend themselves to the study of a particular question and that are representative of a larger group. Frogs, for example, are useful model organisms for elucidating the role of cell movement in morphogenesis because frog development is easy to observe and fairly typical of vertebrate animals.

However, for the more recent research efforts aimed at uncovering the connections between genes and development, many developmental biologists have turned to organisms that are more convenient for genetic analysis. For developmental genetics, the criteria for choosing a model organism include, in addition to readily observable embryos, short generation times, relatively small genomes, and, ideally, preexisting knowledge about the organism and its genes. Several organisms have emerged as favorites, includingDrosophila, the nematodeC. elegans, the mouse, the zebrafish, and the plantArabidopsis(FIGURE 21.3).

Fig 21-3. Model organisms.Each of these organisms offers particular advantages for research on the genetics of development.

First chosen as a model organism by the pioneering geneticist T. H. Morgan and intensively studied by generations of geneticists after him, the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasteris small and easily grown in the laboratory. As you read in Chapter 15,Drosophilahas a generation time of only two weeks and produces many offspring. Embryos develop outside the mother's body, an asset for developmental studies. And researchers can draw on a vast amount of information and experience relating to this animal's genes and other aspects of its biology. (The DNA sequence of its genome was completed in 2000.) One disadvantage of the fruit fly as a model organism for developmental research is that its early development is at least superficially quite different from the process depicted inFIGURE 21.2: The first rounds of mitosis occur without cytokinesis, leading to an early blastula containing a large number of nuclei within a single mass of cytoplasm. Nevertheless, research onDrosophiladevelopment has yielded deep insights into basic principles of animal development, as we will see.

The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansnormally lives in soil but is easily grown in the laboratory in petri dishes. It is only about a millimeter long, has a simple, transparent body with only a few types of cells, and grows from zygote to mature adult in only three and a half days. One of its advantages for genetic studies is that its genome has been sequenced. Another is that most individuals are hermaphrodites, which produce both eggs and sperm. Hermaphrodites are convenient for genetic studies because recessive mutations are easy to detect. As with any diploid organism, an individual with a recessive mutation in only one copy of a gene will have the wild-type phenotype. But a researcher can quickly detect the mutation by allowing the worm to self-fertilize: One-fourth of the offspring will be homozygous for the mutant allele and have a mutant phenotype.

For developmental biologists, a further important feature ofC. elegansis that every adult hermaphrodite has exactly 959 somatic cells (some of which are fused together), and these cells arise from the zygote in virtually the same way for every individual. Using a microscope to follow all the cell divisions starting immediately after a zygote forms, biologists have been able to reconstruct the entire ancestry of every cell in the adult body, the organism's completecell lineage.A cell lineage diagram like the one inFIGURE 21.4(p. 406) is a type offate map, a representation of the fates of various parts of a developing embryo. (You'll see more fate maps in Chapter 47.)

Fig 21-4. Cell lineage inC. elegans.The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis transparent at all stages of its development, making it possible for researchers to trace the lineage of every cell, from the zygote to the adult worm (LM). The diagram shows a detailed lineage only for the intestine, which is derived exclusively from one of the first four cells formed from the zygote. The intestinal cell lineage does not happen to include any programmed cell death, an important aspect of the lineages for some other parts of the animal.

Among vertebrates, two in particular lend themselves to the genetic analysis of development, the mouse and the zebrafish. The mouseMus musculushas a long history as a mammalian model, and much is known about its biology, including its genes. Moreover, researchers are now adept at manipulating mouse genes to make transgenic mice and mice in which particular genes are "knocked out" by mutation. But mice are complex animals with a genome as large as ours, and their embryos develop in the mother's uterus, hidden from view.

Many of the disadvantages of the mouse are absent in a newer vertebrate model, the zebrafishDanio rerio. These small fish (2-4 cm long) are easy to breed in the laboratory in large numbers, and transparent embryos develop outside the mother's body. Although the generation time is relatively long (two to four months), the early stages of development proceed quickly: By 24 hours after fertilization, most of the tissues and early versions of the organs have formed, and by two days a tiny fish hatches out of the egg case. Although the zebrafish genome is still being mapped and sequenced, researchers such as Nancy Hopkins (see the interview at the opening of this unit) have already identified many genes involved in the animal's development.

For studying the molecular genetics of plant development, researchers are focusing on a small weed calledArabidopsis thaliana(the common wall cress, a member of the mustard family). One of these plants can grow in a test tube and produce thousands of progeny after eight to ten weeks; as in Mendel's pea plants, each flower makes both ova and sperm (in pollen). For gene manipulation research, scientists can growArabidopsiscells in culture and get the cells to take up foreign DNA (genetic transformation). Another advantage ofArabidopsisis that it has a relatively small genome, about 100 million nucleotide pairs, which has already been sequenced.

Later in this chapter, you will learn about important discoveries that researchers have made using some of these model organisms.





 Different types of cells in an organism have the same DNA

Much evidence supports the conclusion that nearly all the cells of an organism havegenomic equivalence--that is, they all have the same genes. What happens to these genes as a cell begins to differentiate? We can shed some light on this question by asking whether genes are irreversibly inactivated during differentiation. For example, does an epidermal cell in your finger contain a viable gene specifying eye color, or has the eye-color gene been destroyed or permanently inactivated there?

Totipotency in Plants

One experimental approach to the question of genomic equivalence is to try to generate a whole organism from differentiated cells of a single type. In many plant species, whole new individualscandevelop from differentiated somatic cells. This was first demonstrated during the 1950s by F. C. Steward and his students at Cornell University, working with carrot plants (FIGURE 21.5). They found that differentiated cells removed from the root (the carrot) and placed in culture medium could grow into normal adult plants, each genetically identical to the "parent" plant. Using a single somatic cell from a multicellular organism to make one or more genetically identical individuals is calledcloning,and each new individual is popularly called aclone.(The meanings of these terms vary with context; for clarification, see the Glossary.) The fact that a mature plant cell can dedifferentiate (reverse its differentiation) and then give rise to all the different kinds of specialized cells of a new plant shows that differentiation does not necessarily involve irreversible changes in the DNA. In plants, at least, cells can remaintotipotent;that is, they can retain the zygote's potential to form all parts of the mature organism. Plant cloning is now used extensively in agriculture.

Nuclear Transplantation in Animals

Differentiated cells from animals will often fail to divide in culture, much less develop into a new organism. Therefore, animal researchers have approached the genomic equivalence question by replacing the nucleus of an unfertilized egg cell or zygote with the nucleus of a differentiated cell. Can a nucleus derived from a differentiated cell direct development of an organism with all the proper tissues and organs? The pioneering experiments in nuclear transplantation were carried out by American embryologists Robert Briggs and Thomas King during the 1950s and were later extended by British embryologist John Gurdon. These investigators removed or destroyed the nucleus of a frog egg cell, then transplanted a nucleus from an embryonic or tadpole cell of the same species into the enucleated eggs (FIGURE 21.6). The ability of the transplanted nucleus to support normal development turned out to be inversely related to the age of the donor. In the case of nuclei from the relatively undifferentiated cells of an early embryo, most of the recipient eggs developed into tadpoles. But with nuclei from the differentiated intestinal cells of a tadpole, fewer than 2%  of the eggs developed into normal tadpoles, and most of the embryos failed to make it through even the earliest stages of development.

Fig 21-6. Nuclear transplantation.After the frog egg nucleus is destroyed by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a nucleus from a more advanced developmental stage is inserted into the egg to test whether nuclei change irreversibly as cells begin to differentiate. The earlier the developmental stage from which the nucleus comes, the more likely it will support development. Nuclei from very early embryonic stages frequently prove to be totipotent, whereas nuclei from late developmental stages (such as a tadpole) rarely are.

Developmental biologists agree on several conclusions about these results. First, nucleidochange in some way as cells differentiate. Although the base sequence of the DNA usually does not change, chromatin structure alters in specific ways (for example, the methylation of the DNA may change; see p. 363). In frogs and most other animals, nuclear "potency" tends to be restricted more and more as embryonic development and cell differentiation progress. However, biologists also agree that these chromatin changes are sometimes reversible and that the nuclei of most differentiated animal cells probably have all the genes required for making the entire organism. In other words, biologists believe that the cells of the body differ in structure and function not because they contain different genes, but because they express different portions of a common genome.

Researchers working with mammals have long been able to clone animals using nuclei or cells from a variety of early embryos, but until recently, it was not known whether the restriction of genomic potential in differentiated cells of an adult mammal could be reversed. However, in 1997, Scottish researcher Ian Wilmut and his colleagues captured newspaper headlines with the announcement that they had cloned an adult sheep by transplanting the nucleus from an udder (mammary) cell into an unfertilized egg cell from another sheep (FIGURE 21.7). They achieved the necessary dedifferentiation of the nucleus by culturing mammary cells in nutrient-poor medium, which led to arrest of the cell cycle (seeFIGURE 12.13). The cycle stopped at the G1checkpoint, and the cells entered a G0"resting" phase. The researchers then fused these cells with sheep egg cells whose nuclei had been removed. The resulting diploid cells divided to form early embryos, which the researchers implanted into surrogate mothers. One of several hundred of these embryos, they reported, successfully completed normal development. DNA analyses have since shown that the chromosomal DNA of this sheep, "Dolly," is indeed identical to that of the nucleus donor. (Later experiments showed that Dolly's mitochondrial DNA came from the egg cell donor, as we would expect.)

		Mammary cells were taken from the udder of a sheep and grown in culture with only low levels of nutrients. This semistarvation arrested the cell cycle in G0and apparently allowed the cells to dedifferentiate.
			  
		Meanwhile, an egg cell was taken from another sheep and its nucleus removed.
			  
		A mammary cell in G0was fused with the enucleated egg cell by subjecting the two cells to pulses of electrical current, which also stimulated the egg cell to start dividing.

		The result after gestation was a lamb, Dolly, identical in appearance and in chromosome makeup to the sheep that had donated the mammary cell. (However, Dolly's genes cannot becompletelyidentical to those of the mammary cell donor because Dolly's mitochondrial DNA comes from the egg cell donor.) Dolly was the first reported case of a mammal "cloned" using the nucleus of a differentiated cell. The photograph shows Dolly with her surrogate mother.

In July 1998, researchers in Hawaii reported cloning mice using nuclei from mouse ovary cells, and since then, cloning has been demonstrated in numerous mammals, many important in agriculture. Cloning of farm animals raises safety issues for human consumers, and the possibility of human cloning raises unprecedented ethical issues. However, problems with the cloning process have bought us a little more time for thought. In most cases, only a tiny percentage of cloned embryos develop normally. Why is this? Recently, scientists have found a clue: The DNA of many cloned embryos is improperly methylated, often having extra methyl groups. Because DNA methylation helps regulate gene expression, and appropriate gene expression is key to embryonic development, it makes sense that misplaced methyl groups could interfere with development. Cloning difficulties highlight the fact that we still have much to learn about the basic principles and processes of development.

The Stem Cells of Animals

Another hot research area that depends on the genetic potential retained by animal cells during development involvesstem cells.These are cells with two important properties: As relatively unspecialized cells, they continually reproduce themselves; and under appropriate conditions, they differentiate into specialized cells of one or more types. The adult body has various kinds of stem cells, which serve to replace nonreproducing specialized cells as needed. For example, stem cells in the bone marrow give rise to all the different kinds of blood cells (seeFIGURE 42.15). Another example, whose discovery surprised the scientific world very recently, is stem cells in the adult brain that continue to produce certain kinds of nerve cells there. Stem cells that can give rise to multiple cell types are said to be multipotent or, more often,pluripotent.

Although adults have only tiny numbers of stem cells, scientists are learning to identify and isolate these cells from various tissues and, in some cases, to grow them in culture. Somewhat easier to culture are cells from early embryos, which are mostly "stem cells" that can give rise to differentiated cells of any type. Cultures of theseembryonic stem cellsare "immortal"; the cells reproduce indefinitely (using telomerase to maintain their chromosomal telomeres). Taking this research further, scientists have recently demonstrated that with the right culture conditions (for instance, the addition of specific growth factors), they can make cultured stem cells derived from either source differentiate into specialized cells. Surprisingly, adult stem cells can sometimes be made to differentiate into a wider range of cell types than they normally do in the animal (FIGURE 21.8).

Fig 21-8. Working with stem cells.Animal stem cells--self-perpetuating, relatively undifferentiated cells that can give rise to specialized cells of various types--can be isolated from early embryos or adult tissues and grown in culture. Researchers are seeking to discover the growth conditions that direct stem cells to differentiate into particular cell types.

In addition to providing a valuable means of studying differentiation, stem cell research has enormous potential for medical applications. The ultimate aim is to be able to supply cells for the repair of damaged or diseased organs. For example, providing insulin-producing pancreatic cells to diabetics or certain kinds of brain cells to people with Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease could conceivably cure these diseases. At the present time, embryonic cells are more promising than adult stem cells for such applications, but because the cells are derived from human embryos (commonly, surplus embryos donated by patients undergoing infertility treatment), their use raises ethical and political issues.

In the next section, we look at the molecular basis of cell differentiation.





 Different cell types make different proteins, usually as a result of transcriptional regulation

As the tissues and organs of an embryo take shape, differentiation of their cells becomes apparent; the cells become obviously different in structure and function. Cellular differentiation is actually the outcome of a cell's developmental history extending back to the first mitotic divisions of the zygote. However, the earliest changes that set a cell on a path to specialization are subtle ones, showing up only at the molecular level. Before biologists knew much about the molecular changes occurring in embryos, they coined the termdeterminationto refer to the process that leads up to the observable differentiation of a cell. At the point in the process when the cell is irreversibly committed to its final fate, it is said to be "determined." Today we understand determination in terms of molecular changes. The outcome of determination--differentiation--is heralded by the expression of genes that encodetissue-specific proteins, which are found only in a certain type of cell and give the cell its characteristic structure and function. The first evidence of differentiation is the appearance of the mRNA for these proteins. Eventually, differentiation is observable with a microscope as changes in cellular structure. In most cases, the pattern of gene expression in a differentiated cell--what proteins the cell makes--is controlled at the level of transcription.

Differentiated cells are specialists at making tissue-specific proteins. These are the proteins that allow them to carry out their specialized roles in the organism. Developing lens cells in vertebrates, for example, synthesize large quantities of crystallins, proteins that aggregate to form transparent fibers that give the lens the ability to transmit and focus light. Because no other vertebrate cell type makes crystallins, these proteins are signposts of lens cell differentiation. Lens cells devote 80%  of their capacity for protein synthesis to making this one type of protein.

The differentiation of skeletal muscle cells is another instructive example. The "cells" of skeletal muscle, which we use for walking and lifting and other voluntary movements, are long fibers containing many nuclei within a single plasma membrane. They contain very high concentrations of proteins specific to muscle tissue, such as muscle-specific versions of the contractile proteins myosin and actin and membrane receptor proteins that detect signals from nerve cells. Muscle cells develop from embryonic precursor cells that have the potential to develop into a number of alternative cell types, including cartilage cells or fat cells, but particular conditions commit them to becoming muscle cells. Although the committed cells appear unchanged under the microscope, determination has occurred, and they are nowmyoblasts. Eventually, myoblasts start to churn out large amounts of muscle-specific proteins and fuse to form mature, elongated, multinucleated skeletal muscle cells (FIGURE 21.9).

Fig 21-9. Determination and differentiation of muscle cells.This figure depicts a simplified version of how skeletal muscle cells arise from ordinary-looking embryonic cells that resemble fibroblasts (see the photo inFIGURE 12.15).
			  
		When this kind of embryonic precursor cell receives certain signals from other cells, a master control gene calledmyoDis activated, and the cell makes the MyoD protein. Although the appearance of the cell in the microscope does not change, determination has occurred: The activation ofmyoDcommits the cell, now called a myoblast, to becoming a skeletal muscle cell.
			  
		The MyoD protein is a transcription factor that activates genes encoding other muscle-specific transcription factors. MyoD also turns on genes such asp21that block the cell cycle and thus stop cell division. The various muscle-specific transcription factors activate the genes for muscle proteins such as myosin and actin. Meanwhile, the myoblasts fuse to become multinucleated mature muscle cells, also called muscle fibers.

What actually happens in muscle cell determination? Researchers have been able to answer this question by growing myoblasts in culture and applying some of the techniques you learned about in Chapter 20. To test the hypothesis that certain muscle-specific regulatory genes are active in myoblasts, researchers isolated mRNA from cultured myoblasts and used reverse transcriptase to prepare a library of genes in cDNA form (seeFIGURES 20.5and20.6)--intron-lacking versions of the genes expressed in myoblasts. In cloning the cDNA genes, the researchers positioned them next to a viral promoter that would turn on transcription in any kind of cell. The researchers then inserted each of the cloned genes into a separate embryonic precursor cell and looked for differentiation into myoblasts and muscle cells. In this way, they identified several crucial muscle determination genes, "master regulatory genes" that, when transcribed and translated, commit the cells to becoming skeletal muscle. Thus, in the case of muscle cells, the molecular basis of determination is the expression of one or more of these regulatory genes.

To understand more about how commitment occurs in muscle cell differentiation, let's focus on the master regulatory gene calledmyoD. Researchers learned that the protein product ofmyoD, called MyoD, is a transcription factor. It is a regulatory protein that binds to specific control elements in the DNA and stimulates the transcription of various genes, including some encoding still other muscle-specific transcription factors (see pp. 365-366). Presumably, all these target genes have enhancers recognized by MyoD and are thus coordinately controlled. Finally, the secondary transcription factors activate the muscle protein genes.

The MyoD protein is powerful. Researchers have been able to use it to change some kinds of fully differentiated nonmuscle cells, such as fat cells and liver cells, into muscle cells. Why doesn't it work onallkinds of cells? One likely explanation is that activation of the muscle-specific genes is not solely dependent on MyoD but requires a particularcombinationof regulatory proteins, some of which are lacking in cells that don't respond to MyoD. The determination and differentiation of other kinds of tissues may play out in a similar fashion.





 Transcriptional regulation is directed by maternal molecules in the cytoplasm and signals from other cells

Explaining the role ofmyoDin muscle cell differentiation is a long way from explaining the development of an organism. ThemyoDstory immediately raises the question of what triggers the expression ofthatgene and then raises a series of similar questions leading back to the zygote. What generates thefirstdifferences that arise among the cells in an early embryo? And what controls morphogenesis and the differentiation of all the different cell types as development proceeds? As we saw in the case of muscle cells, this question comes down to which genes are transcribed in the cells of a developing organism. Two sources of information "tell" a cell which genes to express at any given time.

One important source of information that operates early in development is the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg cell, which contains both RNA and protein molecules encoded by the mother's DNA. The cytoplasm of an egg cell and even its cytosolic fluid are not homogeneous. Messenger RNA, proteins, other substances, and organelles are distributed unevenly in the unfertilized egg, and this heterogeneity has a profound impact on the development of the future embryo in many species. After fertilization, the cell nuclei resulting from mitotic division of the zygote are exposed to different cytoplasmic environments. The maternal substances in the egg that influence the course of early development, calledcytoplasmic determinants,regulate the expression of genes that affect the developmental fate of the cells (FIGURE 21.10a).

Fig 21-10. Sources of developmental information for the early embryo.

The other important source of developmental information, which becomes increasingly important as the number of embryonic cells grows, is the environment around a cell. Most important are the signals impinging on an embryonic cell from other embryonic cells in the vicinity. The synthesis of the molecules conveying these signals is controlled by the embryo's own genes. The signal molecules cause changes in nearby target cells, a process calledinduction(FIGURE 21.10b). In general, the signal molecules induce the observable cellular changes by causing a change in gene expression in the target cells. Thus, interactions among embryonic cells eventually induce differentiation of the many specialized cell types making up a new organism. Induction may be accomplished by the diffusion of chemical signals or, if the cells are actually in contact, by cell surface interactions.

You'll learn more about cytoplasmic determinants and induction as we take a closer look at some important genetic and cellular mechanisms of development in three model organisms:Drosophila, C. elegans, andArabidopsis.





 Genetic analysis ofDrosophilareveals how genes control development:an overview

Pattern formation has been most extensively studied inDrosophila melanogaster, where genetic approaches have had spectacular success. These studies have established that genes control development and have led to an understanding of the key roles that specific molecules play in defining position and directing differentiation. Combining anatomical, genetic, and biochemical approaches to the study ofDrosophiladevelopment, researchers have discovered developmental principles common to many other species, including humans.

The Life Cycle of Drosophila

Fruit flies and other arthropods have a modular construction, an ordered series of segments. These segments make up the body's three major parts: the head, the thorax (midbody, from which the wings and legs extend), and the abdomen (seeFIGURE 21.11, bottom). Like other bilaterally symmetrical animals,Drosophilahas an anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis and a dorsal-ventral (back-belly) axis. InDrosophila, cytoplasmic determinants that are present in the unfertilized egg provide positional information for the placement of the two axes even before fertilization. After fertilization, positional information operating on a finer and finer scale establishes a specific number of correctly oriented segments and finally triggers the formation of each segment's characteristic structures.

Fig 21-11. Key developmental events in the life cycle ofDrosophila.In the top drawing, the yellow egg cell is surrounded by other cells, which form a structure called the follicle within one of the mother's ovaries. The egg cell grows as it matures and eventually fills the egg shell that is secreted by the follicle cells; the nurse cells shrink and disappear. The egg is fertilized within the mother and then laid. The embryo develops within the protective egg shell, as described in the text. The cell layer forming the equivalent of the blastula inDrosophilais called the blastoderm.

The developmental stages ofDrosophilaare illustrated inFIGURE 21.11. The egg cell develops in the mother's ovary, surrounded by ovarian cells called nurse cells and follicle cells. These supply the egg cell with nutrients and other substances needed for development and make the egg shell.
			  
		Following fertilization and laying of the egg, mitosis begins. The early mitotic divisions have two notable features. First, the amount of cytoplasm does not change; the first ten divisions, which occur very quickly, consist of S and M phases only, with no growth. Second, cytokinesis does not occur; the earlyDrosophilaembryo is one big multinucleated cell (in contrast to vertebrate embryos; see, for example, FIGURE 47.8).
			  
		At the tenth nuclear division, the nuclei begin to migrate to the periphery of the embryo, and
			  
		at division 13, plasma membranes finally partition the 6,000 or so nuclei into separate cells. Although not yet apparent under the microscope, the basic body plan--including body axes and segment boundaries--has already been determined by this time. A central yolk nourishes the embryo, and the egg shell continues to protect it.


			  
		Subsequent events in the embryo create clearly visible segments, which at first look very much alike.
			  
		Then, some cells move to new positions, organs form, and a wormlike larva (juvenile form) hatches out of the shell.Drosophilagoes through three larval stages, during which the larva eats, grows, and molts (sheds its tough outer layer),
			  
		eventually forming a pupa enclosed in a case.
			  
		Metamorphosis, the change from larva to adult fly, occurs inside the pupal case, and the fly emerges. In the adult, each segment is anatomically distinct, with characteristic appendages. For example, the first thoracic segment bears a pair of legs, the second thoracic segment has a pair of legs plus a pair of wings, and the third thoracic segment bears a pair of legs plus a pair of balancing organs called halteres.

Genetic Analysis of Early Development in Drosophila

During the first half of the 20th century, biologists made detailed anatomical observations of embryonic development in a number of species and performed experiments in which they manipulated embryonic tissues. This research laid the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of development. However, these "classical" embryologists were unable to identify the specific molecules that guide development or determine how patterns are established. In the 1940s, one visionary biologist, Edward B. Lewis, of Caltech, showed that a genetic approach--the study of mutants--could be used to investigateDrosophiladevelopment. Lewis studied bizarre mutants, flies with developmental defects that led to extra wings or legs in the wrong places (seeFIGURE 21.14). He located the mutations on the fly's genetic map, thus connecting the developmental abnormalities to specific genes. This research supplied the first concrete evidence that genes somehow direct the developmental processes studied by embryologists. The genes Lewis discovered control development in the late embryo; we'll return to them shortly.

Fig 21-14. Homeotic mutations and abnormal pattern formation inDrosophila.Homeotic mutations cause a misplacement of structures in an animal. These micrographs contrast the heads of two fruit flies (SEMs). Where small antennae are located in the normal fruit fly (left photo), one homeotic mutant has legs (right photo).

Meanwhile, the mystery of pattern formation during early development remained. But in the late 1970s, two researchers in Germany, Christiane Nmsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, undertook an ambitious quest that finally pushed the understanding of early pattern formation to the molecular level. These scientists set out to identifyallthe genes that affect segment formation inDrosophila. The project was daunting for several reasons. The first was the sheer number ofDrosophilagenes, about 13,000. The genes affecting segmentation might be just a few needles in a haystack or might be so numerous and varied that the scientists would be unable to make sense of them. Second, mutations affecting a process as fundamental as segmentation would surely beembryonic lethals,mutations with phenotypes leading to death at the embryo or larval stage. Because such mutant organisms never reproduce, they cannot be bred for study. Third, because cytoplasmic determinants in the egg were known to play a role in axis formation, the researchers would have to study maternal genes as well as those of the embryo.

N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus dealt with the problem of embryonic lethality by focusing their search on recessive mutations, which could be propagated in heterozygous flies. Their basic strategy was to expose flies to a mutagenic chemical to create mutations in the flies' gametes and then look among the flies' descendants for dead embryos or larvae with abnormal segmentation. By doing the appropriate crosses, they would be able to identify living heterozygotes carrying embryonic lethal mutations. To find as many segmentation genes as possible, they planned asaturation screen:They would make enough mutants to "saturate" the fly genome with mutations. The researchers hoped that the segmentation abnormalities visible in the dead embryos would suggest how the affected genes normally functioned.

After a year of laboriously performing thousands of crosses and examining thousands of dead embryos, N&uuml;sslein-Volhard and Wieschaus succeeded in identifying about 1,200 genes essential for embryonic development, of which about 120 were essential for pattern formation leading to normal segmentation. Over several years, they were able to group the genes by general function, to map them, and to clone many of them. The result was a detailed molecular understanding of the early steps in pattern formation inDrosophila. When their results were combined with Lewis's earlier work, a coherent picture ofDrosophiladevelopment emerged. In recognition of their discoveries, N&uuml;sslein-Volhard, Wieschaus, and Lewis were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1995. Before we discuss how the segmentation genes function, we need to back up and look at the cytoplasmic determinants deposited in the egg by the mother, for these control the expression of the segmentation genes.





 Gradients of maternal molecules in the early embryo control axis formation

As previously mentioned, cytoplasmic determinants are the substances that initially establish the axes of theDrosophilabody. Already present in the unfertilized egg, they are encoded by genes of the mother calledmaternal effect genes.A maternal effect gene is a gene that, when mutant in the mother, results in a mutant phenotype in the offspring, regardless of their genotype. In fruit fly development, maternal effect genes encode proteins or mRNA that are placed in the egg while it is still in the mother's ovary. When the mother has a mutation in such a gene, she makes a defective gene product (or none at all), and her eggs are defective; when these eggs are fertilized, they fail to develop properly.

Because they control the orientation (polarity) of the egg and consequently of the fly, maternal effect genes are also calledegg-polarity genes.One group of these genes sets up the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo, while a second group establishes the dorsal-ventral axis. Like mutations in segmentation genes, mutations in these genes are generally embryonic lethals.

How do products of maternal effect genes determine the body axes of the offspring? Let's focus on one important egg-polarity gene,bicoid, and see how it works. The term bicoid means "two-tailed," and an embryo whose mother was defective in this gene lacks the front half of its body. Instead, the embryo has duplicate posterior structures at both ends (FIGURE 21.12a). This phenotype suggested the hypothesis that the product of the mother'sbicoidgene is essential for setting up the anterior end of the fly and that the gene's product is concentrated at the future anterior end. This hypothesis is a more specific version of thegradient hypothesisfirst proposed by embryologists a century ago. According to this idea, gradients of substances calledmorphogensestablish an embryo's axes and other features of its form.

Fig 21-12. The effect of thebicoidgene, a maternal effect (egg-polarity) gene inDrosophila.

DNA technology and other modern biochemical methods enabled researchers to test the hypothesis that thebicoidproduct is in fact a morphogen that determines the anterior end of the fly. The researchers cloned thebicoidgene and used it as a DNA probe to learn the location ofbicoidmRNA in the eggs produced by wild-type female flies. As predicted by the hypothesis, thebicoidmRNA is concentrated at the extreme anterior end of the egg cell (FIGURE 21.12b). After the egg is fertilized, the mRNA is translated into protein, which diffuses from the anterior end toward the posterior, resulting in a gradient of protein within the early embryo. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that bicoid protein was responsible for specifying the fly's anterior end. To test the hypothesis more specifically, the scientists injected purebicoidmRNA into various regions of early embryos. The protein that resulted from its translation caused anterior structures to form at the injection sites.

Thebicoidresearch is important for several reasons. First, it led to the identification of a specific protein required for some of the earliest steps in pattern formation. Second, it increased our understanding of the mother's role in the development of an embryo. (As one developmental biologist has put it, "Mom tells Junior which way is up.") Finally, the principle that a gradient of molecules can determine polarity and position has proved to be a key developmental concept, just as early embryologists had thought. InDrosophila, gradients of specific proteins determine the posterior end as well as the anterior and also are responsible for establishing the dorsal-ventral axis. Saturation screening has led to the identification of most of the genes and proteins involved.





 A cascade of gene activations sets up the segmentation pattern in Drosophila:a closer look

The bicoid protein and other morphogens that are products of egg-polarity genes are transcription factors, proteins that regulate the activity (transcription) of some of the embryo's own genes. Gradients of these morphogens bring about regional differences in the expression ofsegmentation genes,the genes of the embryo that direct the actual formation of segments after the embryo's major axes are defined.

In a cascade of gene activations, sequential activation of three sets of segmentation genes provides the positional information for increasingly fine details of the animal's modular body plan. First, products of thegap genesmap out the basic subdivisions along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (FIGURE 21.13a). Mutations in these genes cause "gaps" in the animal's segmentation. For example, one gap mutation results in an embryo lacking six abdominal segments.Pair-rule genesare the second set of segmentation genes to act. They define the modular pattern in terms of pairs of segments (FIGURE 21.13b. Mutations in pair-rule genes result in embryos having half the normal segment number because every other segment (odd or even, depending on the mutation) fails to develop. The third set of segmentation genes to act are thesegment polaritygenes, which set the anterior-posterior axis of each segment (FIGURE 21.13c). Embryos with mutations in segment polarity genes have the normal number of segments, but a part of each segment is replaced by a mirror-image repetition of some other part of the segment.

Fig 21-13. Segmentation genes inDrosophila.Soon after fertilization, once the mother's egg-polarity genes have set up the body axes, bicoid protein and other maternal gene products initiate a cascade of activity by segmentation genes in the embryo's nuclei. These micrographs of developing fly embryos illustrate successive bands of regulatory proteins encoded by segmentation genes. The proteins are DNA-binding transcription factors that direct the division of the body into the segments characteristic of flies and other arthropods. The colors result from fluorescent dyes on antibodies bound to the segmentation gene proteins.

The products of many of the segmentation genes, like those of egg-polarity genes, are transcription factors that directly activate the next set of genes in the hierarchical scheme of pattern formation. Other segmentation genes operate more indirectly, supporting the functioning of the transcription factors in various ways. For example, some are components of cell-signaling pathways, including signal molecules used in cell-cell communication and the membrane receptors that recognize them (see Chapter 11). Cell-signaling molecules are critically important once plasma membranes have divided the embryo into separate cellular compartments.

Working together, the products of egg-polarity genes regulate the regional expression of gap genes, which control the localized expression of pair-rule genes, which in turn activate specific segment polarity genes in different parts of each segment. The boundaries and axes of the segments are now set. In the hierarchy of gene activations responsible for pattern formation, the next genes to be expressed determine the specific anatomy of each segment along the embryo.





 Homeotic genes direct the identity of body parts

In a normal fly, structures such as antennae, legs, and wings develop on the appropriate segments. The anatomical identity of the segments is set by master regulatory genes calledhomeotic genes.These are the genes discovered by Edward Lewis. Once the segmentation genes have staked out the fly's segments, homeotic genes specify the types of appendages and other structures that each segment will form. Mutations in homeotic genes produce flies with such strange traits as legs growing from the head in place of antennae (FIGURE 21.14). Thus, as Lewis found, homeotic mutations cause structures characteristic of a particular part of the animal to arise in the wrong place.

Like many of the egg-polarity and segmentation genes preceding them in the developmental cascade, the homeotic genes encode transcription factors. These regulatory proteins control the expression of the genes responsible for specific anatomical structures. For example, a homeotic protein made in the cells of a particular thoracic segment may selectively activate genes that bring about leg development. In contrast, a homeotic protein active in a certain head segment specifies "antennae go here." A mutant version of this protein may label the segment as "thoracic" instead of "head," causing legs to develop in place of antennae. Scientists are now busy identifying the genes activated by the homeotic proteins--the genes specifying the proteins that actually build the fly structures. The following flowchart summarizes the cascade of gene activity in theDrosophilaembryo:





Amazingly, many of the molecules and mechanisms revealed by research on fly pattern formation have turned out to have close counterparts throughout the animal kingdom. And nowhere are the similarities more striking than in the homeotic genes and their products.





 Homeobox genes have been highly conserved in evolution

The homeotic genes ofDrosophilaall include a 180-nucleotide sequence called thehomeobox,which specifies a 60-amino-acidhomeodomain. An identical or very similar sequence of nucleotides has been discovered in genes of many other animals, including other insects, nematodes, mollusks, fish, frogs, birds, and mammals, including humans. (Homeobox-containing genes are often calledHoxgenes, especially in mammals.) Furthermore, related sequences have been found in regulatory genes of much more distantly related eukaryotes, such as yeast, and even in prokaryotes. From these similarities we can deduce that the homeobox DNA sequence evolved very early in the history of life and that it is sufficiently valuable to organisms to have been conserved in animals virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. In fact, the vertebrate genes homologous to the homeotic genes of fruit flies have even kept their chromosomal arrangement (FIGURE 21.15, p. 418).

Fig 21-15. Homologous genes that affect pattern formation in a fruit fly and a mouse.Homeotic homeobox-containing genes that control the form of the anterior and posterior structures of the body occur in the same linear sequence on chromosomes inDrosophilaand mice. Each small box on the chromosomes shown here represents a homeobox-containing gene. In fruit flies, all of these genes are found on one chromosome. The mouse and other mammals have the same or similar sets of genes on four chromosomes. The color code indicates the parts of the embryos in which these genes are expressed and the adult body regions that result. Purple, green, gray, and orange boxes represent genes with homeoboxes that are essentially identical in flies and mice. Black boxes represent genes with homeoboxes that are less similar in the two animals. In vertebrates, homeobox-containing genes are often calledHox genes.

Not all homeobox-containing genes are homeotic genes; that is, some do not directly control the identity of body parts. However, most of these genes are associated with development, suggesting their ancient and fundamental importance in that process. For example, inDrosophila, homeoboxes are present not only in the homeotic genes but also in the egg-polarity genebicoid, in several of the segmentation genes, and in the master regulatory gene for eye development (see the photograph at the beginning of the chapter).

What is the role of the homeodomain in a protein? This polypeptide segment is the part of the protein that binds to DNA when the protein functions as a transcription factor. (The homeodomain forms three a helices, one of which fits neatly into the major groove of the DNA helix.) However, the shape of the homeodomain allows it to bind to any DNA segment; by itself it cannot select a specific sequence. It is other, more variable domains of such a protein that determine which genes the protein regulates. These latter domains interact with other transcription factors that help the protein recognize specific enhancers or promoters in the DNA. Proteins with homeodomains probably regulate development by coordinating the transcription of batteries of developmental genes, switching them on or off (FIGURE 21.16). InDrosophilaembryos, different combinations of homeobox genes are active in different parts of the embryo. This selective expression of regulatory genes, varying over time and space, is central to pattern formation.

Fig 21-16. Homeobox-containing genes as switches.How a particular cell differentiates in the animal's body depends on how many of these switches are thrown--that is, which homeobox proteins are made within the cell. A single master switch may control a number of subordinate switches, which in turn control others. Here the wires represent the actions of the proteins that are the products of the genes.





 Neighboring cells instruct other cells to form particular structures: cell signaling and induction in the nematode

The development of a multicellular organism requires close communication among cells. Even when theDrosophilaembryo is still one multinucleated "cell," signaling between cells has already played a key role. For example, an exchange of signals between the unfertilized egg cell and neighboring follicle cells guided the establishment of the egg's anterior end; it was a follicle cell signal that triggered the localization ofbicoidmRNA there. Once the embryo is truly multicellular, signaling among the embryo's own cells becomes increasingly important. In the process called induction, cells signal nearby cells to change in some specific way, often by expressing particular genes. As we've seen, the ultimate basis for the differences among cells is transcriptional regulation--the turning on and off of specific genes. It is induction, signaling from one group of cells to an adjacent group, that brings about differentiation.

Induction in Vulval Development

The nematodeC. eleganshas proved to be a very useful model organism for investigating the roles of cell signaling and induction in development. Particularly revealing has been research on the development of the nematodevulva, the tiny opening through which the worm lays its eggs. Researchers have combined genetic, biochemical, and embryological approaches to learn how this organ forms.

The pathway from fertilized egg to an adult nematode capable of reproduction involves four larval stages (the larvae look much like smaller versions of the adult). Already present on the ventral surface of the second-stage larva are six cells from which the vulva will arise (FIGURE 21.17a). A single cell of the embryonic gonad, theanchor cell, initiates a cascade of signals that establishes the fates of the vulval precursor cells. If an experimenter destroys the anchor cell with a laser beam, the vulva fails to form and the precursor cells simply become part of the worm's epidermis.

Fig 21-17. Cell signaling and induction in the development of the nematode vulva.The vulva is the opening through which the nematode lays its eggs.

Researchers have figured out the molecular details of vulval induction by isolating mutants in which vulval development is abnormal. Such mutants can grow to adulthood because a normal egg-laying apparatus is not essential for viability. The phenotypes of the mutants range from multiple vulvae to none at all. (In the latter mutants, offspring develop internally within self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, eventually eating their way out of the parent's body!) From studying the mutants, researchers have identified a number of genes involved in vulval development and have worked out where and how their products function (FIGURE 21.17b).

The anchor cell secretes an inducer, a signal protein that binds to a receptor protein in the plasma membrane of vulval precursor cells. (An example of the "unity of life," this signal protein is very similar to theepidermal growth factor (EGF)of humans and other mammals.) At the start, all the precursor cells are equivalent: All make a basic set of proteins necessary for vulval formation, including receptors for the anchor cell's signal molecules. However, these cells do not all respond to the inducer. The cell that normally becomes the inner part of the vulva receives high levels of inducer, since it is closest to the anchor cell. The high levels of inducer probably produce two effects: (1) division and differentiation of the cell to form the inner part of the vulva and (2) activation of a gene for a cell surface signaling protein, which acts as a second inducer. Receptors on the two adjacent vulval precursor cells bind the second inducer, which stimulates these cells to divide and develop into the outer vulva. The three remaining vulval precursor cells are too far away to receive either signal; they give rise to epidermal cells.

The inducer released by the anchor cell and the signal-transduction pathway it triggers in the closest vulval precursor cell are similar to ones you have encountered in previous chapters. The signal is a growth-factor-like protein, and it is transduced within its target cell via a tyrosine-kinase receptor, a Ras protein, and a cascade of protein kinases--a common pathway leading to transcriptional regulation in many organisms (seeFIGURE 19.14a). (The nematode research provided the firstin vivoevidence linking the Ras pathway with a growth factor.)

In summary, vulval development in the nematode illustrates a number of important concepts that apply elsewhere in the development ofC. elegansand many other animals:

In the developing embryo, sequential inductions drive the formation of organs.

The effect of an inducer can depend on its concentration (just as we saw with cytoplasmic determinants inDrosophila).

Inducers produce their effects via signal-transduction pathways similar to those operating in adult cells.

The induced cell's response is often the activation (or inactivation) of genes--transcriptional regulation--which, in turn, establishes the pattern of gene activity characteristic of a particular kind of differentiated cell.

Genetics is a powerful approach for elucidating the mechanisms of development.

Programmed Cell Death (Apoptosis)

Lineage analysis ofC. eleganshas highlighted another outcome of cell signaling that is crucial in animal development--programmed cell death, orapoptosis.The timely suicide of cells occurs exactly 131 times in the course ofC. elegans's normal development. At precisely the same points in each new worm's cell lineage, signals trigger the activation of a cascade of "suicide" proteins in the cells destined to die. The cells shrink, their nuclei condense and then break down, and neighboring cells quickly engulf and digest the remains, leaving no trace (FIGURE 21.18a).

Genetic screening ofC. eleganshas revealed two key apoptosis genes,ced-3andced-4(cedstands for "cell death"), which encode proteins essential for apoptosis. The proteins are called Ced-3 and Ced-4, respectively. These and most other proteins involved in apoptosis are continually present in cells, but in inactive form; thus, proteinactivityis regulated in this case, not transcription or translation. A protein called Ced-9 (the product of geneced-9) is the master regulator of apoptosis (FIGURE 21.18b). The apoptosis pathway activates proteases and nucleases, enzymes that cut up the proteins and DNA of the cell. The main proteases of apoptosis are calledcaspases; in the nematode, the chief caspase is Ced-3.

Apoptosis pathways in humans and other mammals are more complicated. Notably, research on mammals has revealed a prominent role for mitochondria in apoptosis, at least in these more complex animals. Apoptosis pathway proteins or other signals somehow cause the mitochondrial outer membrane to leak, releasing proteins that promote apoptosis. (Surprisingly, these include cytochromec, whose cellular function was thought to have been limited to electron transport; seeFIGURE 9.15). Still controversial is whether mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis or only a subsidiary role. The answer may vary with the circumstance. In any case, a cell must make life-or-death "decisions" by somehow integrating the signals it receives, both "death" signals and "life" signals such as growth factors.

A built-in cell suicide mechanism is essential to development in all animals, and similarities between apoptosis genes in nematodes and mammals indicate that the basic mechanism evolved early in animal evolution. The timely activation of apoptosis proteins in some cells functions in normal development and growth in both embryos and adults. In vertebrates, programmed cell death is essential for normal development of the nervous system, for normal operation of the immune system, and for the normal morphogenesis of human hands and feet. In the last case, the failure of normal cell death can result in webbed fingers and toes. Researchers are also investigating the possibility that certain degenerative diseases of the nervous system result from the inappropriate activation of apoptosis genes and that some cancers result from a failure of cell suicide. Cells that have suffered irreparable damage, including DNA damage that could lead to cancer, normally generateinternalsignals that trigger apoptosis.





 Plant development depends on cell signaling and transcriptional regulation

The last common ancestor of plants and animals was probably a single-celled microbe living hundreds of millions of years ago, so the processes of development must have evolved independently in the two lineages of organisms. Plants evolved with rigid cell walls that make the movement of cells and tissue layers virtually impossible, ruling out a morphogenetic mechanism that is important in animals. Plant morphogenesis relies more heavily on differing planes of cell division and on selective cell enlargement. (You will learn about these processes in Chapter 35.)

But despite the differences between plants and animals, there are some basic similarities in their molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms of development--legacies of their shared cellular origins. In particular, plant development, like that of animals, depends on cell signaling (induction) and transcriptional regulation.

We are just beginning to understand the molecular basis of plant development in detail. Thanks to DNA technology, clues from animal research, and model organisms such asArabidopsis, plant research is now progressing rapidly. The embryonic development of most plants occurs inside the seed and is relatively inaccessible to study (a mature seed already contains a fully formed embryo). However, other important aspects of plant development are observable throughout the plant's life in its meristems, and in particular in the apical meristems at the tips of shoots. It is there that cell division, morphogenesis, and differentiation give rise to new organs, such as leaves or the petals of flowers. We'll discuss two examples of research on floral meristems, the apical meristems that produce flowers.

Cell Signaling in Flower Development

Environmental signals, such as day length and temperature, trigger signal-transduction pathways that convert ordinary shoot meristems to floral meristems. Researchers have combined a genetic approach with tissue transplantation to study induction in the development of tomato flowers. As shown inFIGURE 21.19a(p. 422), a floral meristem is a "bump" consisting of three layers of cells (L1-L3). All three layers participate in the formation of a flower, a reproductive structure with four types of organs: carpels (containing egg cells), petals, stamens (containing sperm-bearing pollen), and sepals (leaflike structures outside the petals).

Fig 21-19. Induction in flower development.

Researchers discovered that tomato plants homozygous for a mutant allele calledfasciated(f)produce flowers with an abnormally large number of organs. Taking advantage of the totipotency of plant cells, they performed an experiment in which they grafted stems from this mutant onto wild-type plants and then grew new plants from the shoots that emerged at the graft sites. The new plants werechimeras,organisms with a mixture of genetically different cells. Some of the chimeras produced floral meristems in which the three cell layers did not all come from the same "parent" (FIGURE 21.19b). The researchers could identify the parental sources of the meristem layers by monitoring other genetic markers, such as an unrelated mutation that caused yellow leaves. They found that the number of organs per flower depends on the genes of the L3 (innermost) cell layer, which somehow induces the overlaying layers L2 and L1 to form that number of organs. The mechanism of cell-cell signaling leading to this induction is not yet known.

Organ Identity Genes in Plants

In contrast to genes controlling organnumberin flowers are genes controlling organidentity. Anorgan identity genedetermines the type of structure that will grow from a meristem--for instance, whether a particular outgrowth from a floral meristem becomes a petal or a stamen. Most of what we know about plant organ identity genes comes from research on flower development inArabidopsis. Organ identity genes are analogous to homeotic genes in animals and are often referred to as plant homeotic genes. Just as a mutation in a fruit fly homeotic gene can cause legs to grow in place of antennae, a mutation in a plant organ identity gene can cause carpels to grow in place of sepals.

By collecting and studying mutants with abnormal flowers, researchers have been able to identify and clone a number of floral organ identity genes, and they are beginning to determine how they act. To follow their work, we need a top view of the floral meristem (FIGURE 21.20a). Viewed from above, the meristem can be divided into four concentric circles, or whorls, each of which develops into a circle of identical organs. The organ-identity genes first identified fell into three classes (A,B, andC), each of which affects two adjacent whorls. A simple model, diagrammed inFIGURE 21.20a, explains how these three kinds of genes can direct the formation of the four types of organs.

Fig 21-20. Organ-identity genes and pattern formation in flower development.This is a model for how genes specify the floral organs inArabidopsis, with some supporting evidence.

This model (hypothesis) predicts that each organ identity gene will be transcribed in two specific whorls of the floral meristem, and once the genes were cloned, the predictions could be tested. Using nucleic acid from cloned genes as probes, researchers showed that the mRNA resulting from the transcription of each class of organ identity gene is present in the appropriate whorls of the developing floral meristem. For example, nucleic acid from aCgene hybridized appreciably only to cells in whorls 3 and 4 because only those cells were making RNA complementary to it (FIGURE 21.20b).

The model also can account for the phenotypes of mutants lackingA,B, orCgene activity with one addition: WhereAgene activity is present, it inhibitsC, and vice versa; if eitherAorCis missing, the other, not inhibited, takes its place.FIGURE 21.20cshows the floral patterns of mutants lacking each of the three classes of organ identity genes and explains how the model accounts for the floral phenotypes.

Further testing of this model and other hypotheses led in 2001 to the discovery of a fourth class of organ identity genes, termed classE. This discovery, combined with studies of the genes and gene products at the molecular level, is allowing researchers to extend and refine the older model.

Presumably the organ identity genes are acting as master regulatory genes, each controlling the activity of a battery of other genes that more directly bring about an organ's structure and function. Indeed, like the homeotic genes of animals, the organ identity genes of plants encode transcription factors that regulate other genes by binding to specific enhancers or promoters in the DNA. The plant genes, however, do not contain the homeobox DNA sequence that characterizes homeotic genes in animals. Instead, they have a sequence that encodes a different DNA-binding domain. Possibly as ancient as the homeobox, this sequence is also present in some transcription factor genes in yeast and animals.

The more scientists learn about the molecules and mechanisms of development in different organisms, the more striking are the underlying similarities that emerge. The similarities reflect the unity--the common ancestry--of life on Earth. But the differences are also crucial, for they have created the huge diversity of organisms that have evolved.

The remainder of the book goes beyond molecules, cells, and genes to explore life on the organismal level.

   What is theoretical about the Darwinian view of life?

Biology came of age on November 24, 1859, the day Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (see upper right). Darwin's book drew a cohesive picture of life by connecting the dots of what had once seemed a bewildering array of unrelated facts. The Origin of Species focused biologists' attention on the great diversity of organisms--their origins and relationships, their similarities and differences, their geographic distribution, and their adaptations to surrounding environments. An understanding of evolution continues to inform every field of biology, from exploring life's molecules to analyzing ecosystems. And applications of evolutionary biology are transforming medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and conservation biology. Because evolution integrates all of biology, it is the main thematic thread woven throughout this book. This unit of chapters explores the mechanisms by which life evolves.

Darwin made two points in The Origin of Species. First, he argued from evidence that the species of organisms inhabiting Earth today descended from ancestral species. Second, he proposed a mechanism for evolution, which he termed natural selection. The basic idea of natural selection is that a population of organisms can change over the generations if individuals having certain heritable traits leave more offspring than other individuals. The result of natural selection is evolutionary adaptation, a prevalence of inherited characteristics that enhance organisms' survival and reproduction in specific environments. In modern terms, we would say that the genetic composition of the population had changed over time, and that is one way of defining evolution. But we can also use the term evolution on a much grander scale to mean all of biological history, from the earliest microbes to the enormous diversity of modern organisms.

In this chapter, you will learn about the Darwinian view of life and its historical development.

To put the Darwinian view in perspective, we must compare it with earlier ideas about Earth and its life. The impact of an intellectual revolution such as Darwinism depends on timing as well as logic. Let's explore the historical context of Darwin's life and ideas (FIGURE 22.1).

 What is theoretical about the Darwinian view of life?



We have set the scene for the Darwinian revolution. Natural theology still dominated the intellectual climate as the 19th century dawned. A few clouds of doubt about the permanence of species were beginning to gather, but no one could have forecast the thundering storm just over the horizon.

Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was born in Shrewsbury in western England. Even as a boy he had a consuming interest in nature. When he was not reading nature books, he was fishing, hunting, and collecting insects. Darwin's father, an eminent physician, could see no future for a naturalist and sent Charles to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Only 16 years old at the time, Charles found medical school boring and distasteful. He left Edinburgh without a degree and shortly thereafter enrolled at Christ College at Cambridge University, with the intent of becoming a clergyman. At that time in Great Britain, most naturalists and other scientists belonged to the clergy, and nearly all saw the world in the context of natural theology. Darwin became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Reverend John Henslow, professor of botany at Cambridge. Soon after Darwin received his B.A. degree in 1831, Professor Henslow recommended the young graduate to Captain Robert FitzRoy, who was preparing the survey ship Beagle for a voyage around the world. Darwin would pay his own way and serve as a conversation companion to the young captain. FitzRoy chose Darwin because of his education and because he was of the same social class and about the same age as the captain.





 Western culture resisted evolutionary views of life

The Origin of Species was truly radical for its time; not only did it challenge prevailing scientific views, but it also shook the deepest roots of Western culture. Darwin's view of life contrasted sharply with the conventional paradigm of an Earth only a few thousand years old, populated by unchanging forms of life that had been individually made during the single week in which the Creator formed the entire universe. Darwin's book challenged a worldview that had been taught for centuries.

The Scale of Nature and Natural Theology

A number of classical Greek philosophers had ideas about the gradual evolution of life. But the philosophers who influenced Western culture most, Plato (427-347 B.C.) and his student Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), held opinions that opposed any concept of evolution. Plato believed in two worlds: a real world that is ideal and eternal and an illusory world of imperfection that we perceive through our senses. Evolution would be counterproductive in a world where ideal organisms were already perfectly adapted to their environments.

Aristotle believed that all living forms could be arranged on a scale, or ladder, of increasing complexity, later called the scala naturae ("scale of nature"). Each form of life had its allotted rung on this ladder, and every rung was taken. In this view of life, which prevailed for over 2,000 years, species are permanent, are perfect, and do not evolve.

In Judeo-Christian culture, the Old Testament account of creation fortified the idea that species were individually designed and nonevolving. In the 1700s, biology in Europe and America was dominated by natural theology, a philosophy dedicated to discovering the Creator's plan by studying nature. Natural theologians saw the adaptations of organisms as evidence that the Creator had designed each and every species for a particular purpose. A major objective of natural theology was to classify species in order to reveal the steps of the scale of life that God had created.

Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778), a Swedish physician and botanist, sought to discover order in the diversity of life "for the greater glory of God." Linnaeus specialized in taxonomy, the branch of biology concerned with naming and classifying the diverse forms of life. He developed the two-part, or binomial, system of naming organisms according to genus and species that is still used today. In addition, Linnaeus adopted a system for grouping similar species into a hierarchy of increasingly general categories. For example, similar species are grouped in the same genus, similar genera (plural of genus) are grouped in the same family, and so on (see FIGURE 1.10). To Linnaeus, clustering similar species together implied no evolutionary kinship, but a century later his taxonomic system would become a focal point in Darwin's arguments for evolution.

Cuvier, Fossils, and Catastrophism

The study of fossils also helped lay the groundwork for Darwin's ideas. Fossils are relics or impressions of organisms from the past, preserved in rock (FIGURE 22.2). Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks formed from the sand and mud that settle to the bottom of seas, lakes, and marshes. New layers of sediment cover older ones and compress them into superimposed layers of rock called strata. Later, erosion may scrape or carve through upper (younger) strata and reveal more ancient strata that had been buried. Fossils within the layers show that a succession of organisms has populated Earth throughout time (FIGURE 22.3).

Fig 22-3. Formation of sedimentary rock and deposition of fossils from different time periods.

Paleontology, the study of fossils, was largely developed by French anatomist Georges Cuvier (1769-1832). Realizing that the history of life is recorded in strata containing fossils, he documented the succession of fossil species in the Paris Basin. He noted that each stratum is characterized by a unique group of fossil species and that the deeper (older) the stratum, the more dissimilar the fossils are from modern life. Cuvier even recognized that extinction had been a common occurrence in the history of life. From stratum to stratum, new species appear and others disappear. Yet Cuvier was a staunch opponent of the evolutionists of his day. Instead, he advocated catastrophism, speculating that each boundary between strata corresponded in time to a catastrophe, such as a flood or drought, that had destroyed many of the species living there at that time. He proposed that these periodic catastrophes were usually confined to local geographic regions and that the ravaged region was repopulated by species immigrating from other areas.





 Theories of geologic gradualism helped clear the path for evolutionary biologists

Competing with Cuvier's theory of catastrophism was a very different idea of how geologic processes had shaped Earth's crust. In 1795, Scottish geologist James Hutton (1726-1797) proposed that it was possible to explain the various landforms by looking at mechanisms currently operating in the world. For example, he suggested that canyons were formed by rivers cutting down through rocks and that sedimentary rocks with marine fossils were built of particles that had eroded from the land and been carried by rivers to the sea (FIGURE 22.4). Hutton explained Earth's geologic features by the theory of gradualism, which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes.

Fig 22-4. Strata of sedimentary rock at the Grand Canyon. The Colorado River has cut through over 2,000 meters of rock, exposing sedimentary layers that are like huge pages from the book of life. Scan the canyon wall from rim to floor, and you look back through hundreds of millions of years. Each layer entombs fossils that represent some of the organisms from that period of Earth's history.

The leading geologist of Darwin's era, a Scot named Charles Lyell (1797-1875), incorporated Hutton's gradualism into a theory known as uniformitarianism. The term refers to Lyell's idea that geologic processes have not changed throughout Earth's history. Thus, for example, the forces that build mountains and erode mountains and the rates at which these forces operate are the same today as in the past.

Darwin was strongly influenced by two conclusions that followed directly from the observations of Hutton and Lyell. First, if geologic change results from slow, continuous actions rather than sudden events, then Earth must be very old, certainly much older than the 6,000 years assigned by many theologians on the basis of biblical inference. Second, very slow and subtle processes persisting over a long period of time can add up to substantial change. Darwin was not the first to apply the principle of gradualism to biological evolution, however.





 Lamarck placed fossils in an evolutionary context

Toward the end of the 18th century, several naturalists, including Erasmus Darwin, Charles Darwin's grandfather, suggested that life had evolved as environments changed. But only one of Charles Darwin's predecessors developed a comprehensive model that attempted to explain how life evolves: Jean Baptiste Lamarck.

Lamarck published his theory of evolution in 1809, the year Darwin was born. Lamarck was in charge of the invertebrate collection at the Natural History Museum in Paris. By comparing current species with fossil forms, Lamarck could see what appeared to be several lines of descent, each a chronological series of older to younger fossils leading to a modern species.

Lamarck is remembered most for the mechanism he proposed to explain how specific adaptations evolve. It incorporates two ideas that were popular during Lamarck's era. The first was use and disuse, the idea that those parts of the body used extensively to cope with the environment become larger and stronger while those that are not used deteriorate. Among the examples Lamarck cited were a blacksmith developing a bigger bicep in the arm that wields the hammer and a giraffe stretching its neck to reach leaves on high branches. The second idea Lamarck adopted was called the inheritance of acquired characteristics. In this concept of heredity, the modifications an organism acquires during its lifetime can be passed along to its offspring. The long neck of the giraffe, Lamarck reasoned, evolved gradually as the cumulative product of a great many generations of ancestors stretching ever higher.

There is, however, no evidence that acquired characteristics can be inherited. Blacksmiths may increase strength and stamina by a lifetime of pounding with a heavy hammer, but these acquired traits do not change genes transmitted by gametes to offspring. Even though the Lamarckian theory of evolution is ridiculed often today because of its erroneous assumption that acquired characteristics are inherited, in Lamarck's time that concept of inheritance was generally accepted (and, indeed, Darwin could offer no acceptable alternative). To most of Lamarck's contemporaries, however, the mechanism of evolution was an irrelevant issue because they firmly believed that species were fixed and that no theory of evolution could be taken seriously. Lamarck was vilified, especially by Cuvier, who denied that species ever evolve. In retrospect, Lamarck deserves much credit for his theory, which was visionary in many respects: in its claim that evolution is the best explanation for both the fossil record and the current diversity of life; in its recognition of the great age of Earth; and especially in its emphasis on adaptation to the environment as a primary product of evolution.





 Field research helped Darwin frame his view of life

The Voyage of the Beagle

Darwin was 22 years old when he sailed from Great Britain aboard HMS Beagle in December 1831 (FIGURE 22.5). The primary mission of the voyage was to chart poorly known stretches of the South American coastline. While the ship's crew surveyed the coast, Darwin spent most of his time on shore, observing and collecting thousands of specimens of South American plants and animals. As the ship worked its way around the continent, Darwin observed the various adaptations of plants and animals that inhabited such diverse environments as the Brazilian jungles, the expansive grasslands of the Argentine pampas, the desolate lands of Tierra del Fuego near Antarctica, and the towering heights of the Andes Mountains.

Fig 22-5. The Voyage of HMS Beagle. The two insets illustrate the ship and a marine iguana, one of the unique animals that evolved on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands.

Darwin noted that plants and animals he studied had definite South American characteristics, very distinct from those of Europe. That in itself may not have been surprising. But Darwin also noted that the plants and animals in temperate regions of South America were more closely related to species living in tropical regions of that continent than to species in temperate regions of Europe. Furthermore, the South American fossils that Darwin found, though clearly different from modern species, were distinctly South American in their resemblance to the living plants and animals of that continent.

The geographic distribution of species interested Darwin. For example, he was curious about the fauna of the Gal&aacute;pagos, islands of relatively recent volcanic origin that lie on the equator about 900 km west of the South American coast (see FIGURE 22.5). Darwin did not grasp the full significance of the Gal&aacute;pagos animals until he studied his collections after returning to England in 1836. He then learned that most of the animal species on the Gal&aacute;pagos live nowhere else in the world, although they resemble species living on the South American mainland. It was as though the islands had been colonized by plants and animals that strayed from the South American mainland and then diversified on the different islands. Among the birds Darwin collected on the Gal&aacute;pagos were several types of finches that, although quite similar, seemed to be different species. Some were unique to individual islands, while other species were distributed on two or more islands that were close together.

Darwin read Lyell's Principles of Geology while on board the Beagle. Lyell's ideas, together with his own experiences on the Gal&aacute;pagos, had Darwin doubting the church's position that Earth was static and had been created only a few thousand years ago. By acknowledging that Earth was very old and constantly changing, Darwin took an important step toward recognizing that life on Earth had also evolved.

Darwin's Focus on Adaptation

Soon after returning to Great Britain in 1836, Darwin started reassessing all that he had observed during the voyage of the Beagle. He began to perceive the origin of new species and adaptation to the environment as closely related processes. Could a new species arise from an ancestral form by the gradual accumulation of adaptations to a different environment? From studies made years after Darwin's voyage, biologists have concluded that this is what happened to the Gal&aacute;pagos finches. Among the differences between the finches are their beaks, which are adapted to the specific foods available on their home islands (FIGURE 22.6). Darwin anticipated that explaining how such adaptations arise was essential to understanding evolution.

Fig 22-6. Gal&aacute;pagos finches. The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands have a total of 14 species of closely related finches, some found only on a single island. The most striking difference among species is their beaks, which are adapted for specific diets. See also FIGURE 1.17b.

By the early 1840s, Darwin had worked out the major features of his theory of natural selection as the mechanism of evolution. However, he had not yet published his ideas. He was in poor health, and he rarely left home. Despite his reclusiveness, Darwin was not isolated from the scientific community. Already famous as a naturalist because of the letters and specimens he sent to Great Britain during the voyage of the Beagle, Darwin had frequent correspondence and visits from Lyell, Henslow, and other scientists.

In 1844, Darwin wrote a long essay on the origin of species and natural selection. However, Darwin was reluctant to introduce his theory publicly, apparently because he anticipated the uproar it would cause. Darwin asked his wife to publish his essay if he died before writing a more thorough dissertation on evolution. While he procrastinated, he continued to compile evidence in support of his theory. Lyell, not himself yet convinced of evolution, nevertheless advised Darwin to publish on the subject before someone else came to the same conclusions and published first.

In June 1858, Lyell's prediction came true. Darwin received a letter from Alfred Wallace (1823-1913), a young British naturalist working in the East Indies. The letter was accompanied by a manuscript in which Wallace developed a theory of natural selection essentially iden tical to Darwin's. Wallace asked Darwin to evaluate the paper and forward it to Lyell if it merited publication. Darwin complied, writing to Lyell: "Your words have come true with a vengeance&#160;...&#160;. I never saw a more striking coincidence&#160;...&#160;so all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed." Lyell and a colleague presented Wallace's paper, along with extracts from Darwin's unpublished 1844 essay, to the Linnaean Society of London on July 1, 1858. Darwin quickly finished The Origin of Species and published it the next year. Although Wallace wrote up his ideas for publication first, Darwin developed and supported the theory of natural selection so much more extensively that he is known as its main architect. And Darwin's notebooks prove that he formulated his theory of natural selection 15 years before reading Wallace's manuscript.

Within a decade, Darwin's book and its proponents had convinced the majority of biologists that biological diversity was the product of evolution. Darwin succeeded where previous evolutionists had failed, partly because science was beginning to shift away from natural theology, but mainly because he convinced his readers with immaculate logic and an avalanche of evidence in support of evolution.





 The Origin of Species developed two main points: the occurrence of evolution and natural selection as its mechanism

Darwinism has a dual meaning. It refers to evolution as the explanation for life's unity and diversity, and it also refers to the Darwinian concept of natural selection as the cause of adaptive evolution.

Descent with Modification

In the first edition of The Origin of Species, Darwin did not use the word evolution until the last paragraph, referring instead to descent with modification, a phrase that condensed his view of life. Darwin perceived unity in life, with all organisms related through descent from some unknown ancestor that lived in the remote past. As the descendants of that ancestral organism spilled into various habitats over millions of years, they accumulated diverse modifications, or adaptations, that fit them to specific ways of life.

In the Darwinian view, the history of life is like a tree, with multiple branching and rebranching from a common trunk all the way to the tips of the youngest twigs, symbolic of the diversity of living organisms. At each fork of the evolutionary tree is an ancestor common to all lines of evolution branching from that fork. Closely related species, such as the Asian elephant and the African elephant, are very similar because they share the same line of descent until a relatively recent divergence from a common ancestor (FIGURE 22.7). Most branches of evolution, even some major ones, are dead ends; about 99%  of all species that have ever lived are extinct.

Fig 22-7. Descent with modification. This evolutionary tree of the elephant family is based mainly on evidence from fossils--their anatomy, their order of appearance in geologic time, and their geographic distribution. (Timeline not to scale.)

Ironically, Linnaeus, who apparently believed that species are fixed, provided Darwin with a connection to evolution by recognizing that the great diversity of organisms could be ordered into "groups subordinate to groups" (Darwin's phrase). FIGURE 1.10 introduced the major taxonomic categories; let's review them here: kingdom &gt; phylum &gt; class &gt; order &gt; family &gt; genus &gt; species.

To Darwin, the natural hierarchy of the Linnaean scheme reflected the branching history of the tree of life, with organisms at the different taxonomic levels related through descent from common ancestors. Two species, such as lions and tigers, that are grouped in the same family (family Felidae) share a more recent common ancestor than two species, such as lions and elephants, that belong to different families within the same class (class Mammalia).

Natural Selection and Adaptation

How does natural selection work? And how does natural selection explain adaptation? Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr has dissected the logic of Darwin's theory of natural selection into three inferences based on five observations:*

OBSERVATION #1: All species have such great potential fertility that their population size would increase exponentially if all individuals that are born reproduced successfully (FIGURE 22.8).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 22-8. Overproduction of offspring. A cloud of millions of spores is exploding from this puffball, a type of fungus. The wind will disperse the spores far and wide. Only a tiny fraction of the spores will actually give rise to offspring that survive and reproduce.

OBSERVATION #2: Populations tend to remain stable in size, except for seasonal fluctuations.

OBSERVATION #3: Environmental resources are limited.

INFERENCE #1: Production of more individuals than the environment can support leads to a struggle for existence among individuals of a population, with only a fraction of offspring surviving each generation.

OBSERVATION #4: Individuals of a population vary extensively in their characteristics; no two individuals are exactly alike (FIGURE 22.9).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 22-9. A few of the color variations in a population of Asian lady beetles.

OBSERVATION #5: Much of this variation is heritable.

INFERENCE #2: Survival in the struggle for existence is not random, but depends in part on the hereditary constitution of the individuals. Those individuals whose inherited traits best fit them to their environment are likely to leave more offspring than less fit individuals.

INFERENCE #3: This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to a gradual change in a population, with favorable characteristics accumulating over the generations.



We can summarize Darwin's main ideas as follows:

Natural selection is differential success in reproduction (unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce).

Natural selection occurs through an interaction between the environment and the variability inherent among the individual organisms making up a population.

The product of natural selection is the adaptation of populations of organisms to their environment (FIGURE 22.10, p. 436).

Let's elaborate on the important connections Darwin perceived between natural selection, the struggle for existence, and the capacity of organisms to "overreproduce." Darwin appparently began to recognize the struggle for existence after he read an essay on human population written in 1798 by Thomas Malthus (see FIGURE 22.1). Malthus contended that much of human suffering--disease, famine, homelessness, and war--was the inescapable consequence of the potential for the human population to increase faster than food supplies and other resources. The capacity to overproduce seems to be characteristic of all species. Of the many eggs laid, young born, and seeds spread, only a tiny fraction complete their development and leave offspring of their own (see FIGURE 22.8). The rest are eaten, frozen, starved, diseased, unmated, or unable to reproduce for some other reason.

In each generation, environmental factors filter heritable variations, favoring some over others. Differential reproduction--whereby organisms with traits favored by the environment produce more offspring than do organisms without those traits--results in the favored traits being disproportionately represented in the next generation. This increasing frequency of the favored traits in a population is evolution.

Darwin illustrated the power of selection as a force in evolution with examples from artificial selection, the breeding of domesticated plants and animals. Humans have modified other species over many generations by selecting individuals with the desired traits as breeding stock. The plants and animals we grow for food often bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors (FIGURE 22.11). The power of selective breeding is especially apparent in our pets, which have been bred more for fancy than for utility.

If so much change can be achieved by artificial selection in a relatively short period of time, Darwin reasoned, then natural selection should be capable of considerable modification of species over hundreds or thousands of generations. Even if the advantages of some heritable traits over others are slight, the advantageous variations will accumulate in the population after many generations of natural selection, eliminating less favorable variations.

Darwin incorporated gradualism, a concept so important in Lyell's geology, into evolutionary theory. He envisioned life as evolving by a gradual accumulation of minute changes, and he postulated that natural selection operating in varying contexts over vast spans of time could account for the entire diversity of life.

We can now summarize the two main features of the Darwinian view of life: (1) The diverse forms of life have arisen by descent with modification from ancestral species and (2) the mechanism of modification has been natural selection working over enormous tracts of time.

Some Subtleties of Natural Selection. At this point, we need to emphasize several subtleties of natural selection. One is the importance of populations in evolution. For now, we will define a population as a group of interbreeding individuals belonging to a particular species and sharing a common geographic area. A population is the smallest unit that can evolve. Natural selection occurs through interactions between individual organisms and their environment, but individuals do not evolve. Evolution can be measured only as changes in relative proportions of heritable variations in a population over a succession of generations.

Another key point about natural selection is that it can amplify or diminish only heritable variations. As we have seen, an organism may become modified through its own experiences during its lifetime, and such acquired characteristics may even adapt the organism to its environment, but there is no evidence that characteristics acquired during a lifetime can be inherited. We must distinguish between adaptations an organism acquires by its own actions and inherited adaptations that evolve in a population over many generations as a result of natural selection.

It must also be emphasized that the specifics of natural selection are situational; environmental factors vary from place to place and from time to time. An adaptation in one situation may be useless or even detrimental in different circumstances. Some examples will reinforce this situational quality of natural selection.





 Examples of natural selection provide evidence of evolution

Natural selection and the adaptive evolution it causes are observable phenomena. As described in the interview at the beginning of this unit, Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University are documenting natural selection and evolution in populations of finches in the Gal&aacute;pagos. We will now look at two additional examples of natural selection as a pervasive mechanism of evolution in populations.

Natural Selection in Action: The Evolution of Insecticide-Resistant Insects

A classic and unsettling example of natural selection is the evolution of insecticide resistance in hundreds of insect species. Insecticides are poisons used to kill insects that are pests in farmlands, swamps, backyards, and homes. Examples are DDT, now banned in many countries, and malathion. We have used insecticides to control insects that eat our crops, transmit diseases such as malaria, or just annoy us around the house or campground, but these chemical weapons have proved to be double-edged swords. These poisons are not specific for the intended targets, and their widespread use has produced some colossal environmental problems, which we'll examine in Chapter 54. Our focus here is the evolutionary outcome of introducing these chemicals into the environments of insects.

Whenever a new type of insecticide is used to control agricultural pests, the story is usually the same. Early results are encouraging. A relatively small amount of the poison dusted onto a crop may kill 99%  of the insects. But subsequent sprayings are less and less effective. One response is to increase the amount of the poison, but that brings high monetary (not to mention environmental) costs. Another strategy is for the farmer to switch to a different insecticide until it, too, becomes ineffective.

It is natural selection that causes the evolution of resistance to insecticides. The relatively few survivors of the first insecticide wave are insects with genes that somehow enable them to resist the chemical attack (FIGURE 22.12). In some cases, the lucky few carry genes coding for enzymes that destroy the insecticide. The poison kills most members of the insect population, leaving the resistant individuals to reproduce. And their offspring inherit the genes for insecticide resistance. In each generation, the proportion of insecticide-resistant individuals in the insect population increases. The population has adapted to a change in its environment.

Fig 22-12. Evolution of insecticide resistance in insect populations.

This example of insect adaptation to insecticides highlights two key points about natural selection. First, notice that natural selection is more a process of editing than it is a creative mechanism. An insecticide does not create resistant individuals, but selects for resistant insects that were already present in the population. Second, note again that natural selection is contingent on time and place. It favors those characteristics in a varying population that fit the current, local environment. What is adaptive in one situation may be useless or even detrimental in different circumstances. For example, some genetic mutations that endow houseflies with resistance to the insecticide DDT also reduce a fly's growth rate. Before DDT was introduced to environments, those particular genes were a handicap. But the appearance of DDT changed the environmental arena and favored insecticide-resistant individuals.

Natural Selection in Action: The Evolution of Drug-Resistant HIV

Researchers have developed numerous drugs to combat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes AIDS (see Chapter 18). In every case, resistance to a drug evolves rapidly in the HIV population of an individual patient soon after treatment with that drug begins. For example, FIGURE 22.13 illustrates the evolution of resistance to a drug named 3TC. Notice that the 3TC-resistant forms of HIV begin to increase in number almost immediately and make up 100%  of the total HIV population in each patient after just a few weeks.

Fig 22-13. Evolution of drug resistance in HIV. In patients being treated with the anti-HIV drug 3TC, a very small number of drug-resistant viruses are present at the beginning of the treatment, but natural selection increases their frequency over time. Though the exact time course differs between patients, 3TC-resistant HIV makes up 100%  of the virus populations within a few weeks in all cases.

Scientists designed the drug 3TC to interfere with reverse transcriptase, the enzyme HIV uses to copy its RNA genome into the DNA of the human host cell (see FIGURE 18.7). DNA, remember, is a polymer of four kinds of nucleotides, abbreviated A, G, T, and C (see Chapter 16). The drug 3TC mimics the C (cytosine) nucleotide of DNA. The HIV's reverse transcriptase will pick up a 3TC molecule instead of C and insert it into a growing DNA chain. This error terminates further elongation of the DNA and thus blocks reproduction of the HIV.

The 3TC-resistant variety of HIV has a slightly different version of reverse transcriptase that is able to discriminate between the drug and the normal C nucleotide. Members of the HIV population that inherit the gene for this form of the enzyme have no advantage in the absence of 3TC; in fact, they replicate their DNA more slowly than the "normal" variety of HIV. But once 3TC is added to the environment of these viruses, it becomes a potent force in natural selection, favoring reproduction of the resistant individuals.





 Other evidence of evolution pervades biology

We have examined cases of evolution by natural selection that occur rapidly enough to be directly observed. However, the much grander changes of biological diversity documented by the fossil record occur on a time scale spanning hundreds of millions of years. Evidence that the diversity of life is a product of evolution prevades every research field of biology. And, as biology progresses, new discoveries, including the revelations of molecular biology, continue to validate the Darwinian view of life.

Homology

Descent with modification, Darwin's term for evolution, means that new species descend from ancestral species by the accumulation of modifications as populations adapt to new environments. The novel features that characterize a new species are not entirely new, but are altered versions of ancestral features. Species with common ancestry should display underlying similarities, even in features that no longer match in function. Similarity in characteristics resulting from common ancestry is known as homology.

Anatomical Homologies. Descent with modification is indeed evident in anatomical similarities between species grouped in the same taxonomic category. For example, many of the same skeletal elements make up the forelimbs of humans, cats, whales, bats, and all other mammals, although these appendages have very different functions (FIGURE 22.14). Surely, the best way to construct the infrastructure of a bat's wing is not also the best way to build a whale's flipper. Such anatomical peculiarities make no sense if the structures are uniquely engineered and unrelated. A more likely explanation is that the basic similarity of these forelimbs is the consequence of the descent of all mammals from a common ancestor. The forelegs, wings, flippers, and arms of different mammals are variations on a common structural theme. In taking on different functions in each species, the basic structures were modified. Such anatomical signs of evolution are called homologous structures.

Fig 22-14. Homologous structures: anatomical signs of descent with modification. The forelimbs of all mammals are constructed from the same skeletal elements (color-coded in these diagrams). The hypothesis that all mammals descend from a common ancestor predicts that their forelimbs, though diversely adapted, would be variations on a common anatomical theme.

Comparative anatomy, the comparison of body structures between species, confirms that evolution is a remodeling process. The historical constraints of this retrofitting are evident in anatomical imperfections. For example, the human knee joint and spine were derived from ancestral structures that supported four-legged mammals. Almost none of us will reach old age without experiencing knee or back problems. If these structures had first taken form specifically to support our bipedal posture, we would expect them to be less subject to injury. The anatomical remodeling that stood us up was apparently constrained by our evolutionary history.

Some of the most interesting homologous structures are vestigial organs, structures of marginal, if any, importance to the organism. Vestigial organs are historical remnants of structures that had important functions in ancestors. For instance, the skeletons of some snakes retain vestiges of the pelvis and leg bones of walking ancestors. We would not expect to see these structures if snakes had an origin separate from other vertebrate animals.

Embryological Homologies. Sometimes, homologies that are not obvious in adult organisms become evident when we look at embryonic development. For example, all vertebrate embryos have structures called pharyngeal pouches in their throat regions at some stage in their development. These embryonic structures develop into homologous structures with very different functions, such as the gills of fish or the Eustachian tubes that connect the middle ear with the throat in humans and other mammals.

Molecular Homologies. Anatomical homology cannot help us link such distantly related organisms as plants and animals, which have no anatomy in common. However, plants and animals, along with all other organisms, do share certain characteristics at the molecular level: For example, all species of life use the same basic genetic machinery of DNA and RNA, and the genetic code is essentially universal (see Chapter 17). Evidently, the language of the genetic code has been passed along through all branches of the tree of life ever since the code's inception in an early life-form. Molecular biology provides new tools for exploring evolutionary relationships in the diversity of life.

Homologies and the Tree of Life. Homologies mirror the taxonomic hierarchy of the tree of life. Some homologies, such as the genetic code, are shared by all life because they date back to the deep ancestral past. Homologies that evolved more recently are shared only by smaller branches of the tree of life. For example, all tetrapods (from the Greek tetra, "four," and pod, "foot"), the vertebrate branch consisting of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, share the same basic five-digit limb structure illustrated for mammals in FIGURE 22.14. Thus, homologies form a layered pattern, with all life sharing the deepest layer and each smaller group adding fresh homologies to those they share with larger groups. This hierarchical pattern is exactly what we would expect if life evolved and diversified from a common ancestor, but not what we would see if each species arose separately.

If homologies reflect evolutionary history, we should expect to find similar patterns whether we are comparing molecules or bones or any other characteristics. The new tools of molecular biology have generally corroborated rather than contradicted evolutionary trees based on comparative anatomy and other methods. Evolutionary relationships among species are documented in their DNA and proteins--in their genes and gene products. If two species have libraries of genes and proteins with sequences that match closely, the sequences have probably been copied from a common ancestor. (If two long paragraphs match except for the substitution of a letter here and there, we would surely attribute them both to a single source.) TABLE 22.1 compares the amino acid sequence of human hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting protein of blood, with the hemoglobin of other vertebrates. The data show the same pattern of evolutionary relationships that researchers find when they compare other proteins or assess relationships based on nonmolecular methods, such as skeletal anatomy. The Darwinian view of life predicts that different kinds of homologies--anatomical, embryological, and molecular--will fall into the same hierarchical pattern because they have all evolved during the same branching pattern of evolutionary history.

125Biogeography

The geographic distribution of species--biogeography--first suggested evolution to Darwin. Species tend to be more closely related to other species from the same area than to other species with the same way of life but living in different areas. For example, Australia is the home of a group of mammals--the marsupials--that are distinct from another group of mammals--the eutherians--that live elsewhere on Earth. (Eutherians are mammals that complete their embryonic development in the uterus, while marsupials are born as embryos and complete their development in an external pouch.) Some Australian marsupials have eutherian look-alikes with similar adaptations living on other continents. For example, a forest-dwelling marsupial called the sugar glider is superficially very similar to flying squirrels, eutherians that live in North American forests (FIGURE 22.15). These two mammals have adapted to the same way of life, but they evolved independently from different ancestors. The sugar glider is distinctly marsupial, much more closely related to kangaroos and other Australian marsupials than to flying squirrels or any other eutherian mammals. The sugar glider is a marsupial not because that is a requirement for its gliding lifestyle but simply because its ancestors were marsupials. The unique fauna of Australia diversified on that island continent after it became isolated from the landmasses on which placental mammals diversified. The resemblance between sugar gliders and flying squirrels is an example of what biologists call convergent evolution (we'll take a closer look at convergence in Chapter 25).

Fig 22-15. Different geographic regions, different mammalian "brands." The sugar glider is an example of the diverse marsupial life that evolved in isolation on the island continent of Australia. The resemblance of sugar gliders to the eutherian flying squirrels of North America is not due to a close evolutionary relationship but to convergent evolution in similar environmental contexts.

Islands are showcases of biogeographic evidence for evolution. They generally have many species of plants and animals that are endemic, which means they are found nowhere else in the world. And yet, as Darwin observed when he reassessed his collections from the voyage of the Beagle, most island species are closely related to species from the nearest mainland or neighboring island. This explains why two islands with similar environments in different parts of the world are populated not by closely related species but by species taxonomically affiliated with the plants and animals of the nearest mainland, where the environment is often quite different. Island chains, or archipelagos, are especially interesting in their biogeography. If a species that disperses from a mainland to an island succeeds in its new environment, it may give rise to several new species as populations spread to other islands in the archipelago. The example of finches on the Gal&aacute;pagos archipelago came up earlier in the chapter. FIGURE 22.16 illustrates another example, the evolution of fruit flies (Drosophila) on the Hawaiian archipelago.

Fig 22-16. The evolution of fruit fly (Drosophila) species on the Hawaiian archipelago. Geologists have determined the ages of these volcanic islands, which are progressively younger from Kauai (the oldest) to the big island of Hawaii (the youngest, still growing as active volcanoes add lava rock to the shoreline). The islands have about 500 endemic species of the fruit fly genus Drosophila, all descended from a common ancestor that managed to reach Kauai over 5 million years ago. The arrows trace the history of just a few of the species in one evolutionary branch. The vintage of each species closely matches the age of its island home.

The Fossil Record

The succession of fossil forms is compatible with what is known from other types of evidence about the major branches of descent in the tree of life. For instance, evidence from biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology places prokaryotes as the ancestors of all life and predicts that prokaryotes should precede all eukaryotic life in the fossil record. Indeed, the oldest known fossils are prokaryotes. Another example is the chronological appearance of the different classes of vertebrate animals in the fossil record. Fossil fishes predate all other vertebrates, with amphibians next, followed by reptiles, then mammals and birds. This sequence is consistent with the history of vertebrate descent as revealed by many other types of evidence. In contrast, the idea that all species were individually created at about the same time predicts that all vertebrate classes would make their first appearance in the fossil record in rocks of the same age, a prediction at odds with what paleontologists actually observe.

The Darwinian view of life also predicts that evolutionary transitions should leave signs in the fossil record. Paleontologists have discovered fossils of many transitional forms that link even older fossils to modern species. For example, a series of fossils documents the changes in skull shape and size that occurred as mammals evolved from reptiles. Every year, paleontologists turn up other important links between modern forms and their ancestors. In the past few years, for instance, researchers have found fossilized whales that link these aquatic mammals to their terrestrial predecessors (FIGURE 22.17, p. 442).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 22-17. A transitional fossil linking past and present. The hypothesis that whales evolved from terrestrial (land-dwelling) ancestors predicts a four-limbed beginning for whales. Paleontologists digging in Egypt and Pakistan have identified extinct whales that had hind limbs. Shown here are the fossilized leg bones of Basilosaurus, one of those ancient whales. These whales were already aquatic animals that no longer used their legs to support their weight. The leg bones of an even older fossilized whale named Ambulocetus are heftier. Ambulocetus may have split its time between living on land and in water.

Thus, the Darwinian view of life endures in biology because it is supported by independent types of evidence: evolutionary patterns of homology that match patterns in space (biogeography) and time (the fossil record).





 What is theoretical about the Darwinian view of life?

Some people dismiss Darwinism as "just a theory." This tactic for nullifying the evolutionary view of life has two flaws. First, it fails to separate Darwin's two claims: that modern species evolved from ancestral forms and that natural selection is the main mechanism for this evolution. The conclusion that life has evolved is based on historical evidence--the signs of evolution discussed in the previous section.

What, then, is theoretical about evolution? Theories are our attempts to explain facts and integrate them with overarching concepts. To biologists, Darwin's theory of evolution is natural selection--the mechanism Darwin proposed to explain the historical facts of evolution documented by fossils, biogeography, and other types of evidence.

So the "just a theory" argument concerns only Darwin's second point, his theory of natural selection. This brings us to the second flaw in the "just a theory" case. The term theory has a very different meaning in science than in everyday use. The colloquial use of the word theory comes close to what scientists mean by a hypothesis. In science, a theory is more comprehensive than a hypothesis. A theory, such as Newton's theory of gravitation or Darwin's theory of natural selection, accounts for many facts and attempts to explain a great variety of phenomena. Such a unifying theory does not become widely accepted in science unless its predictions stand up to thorough and continual testing by experiments and observations (see Chapter 1). Even then, good scientists do not allow theories to become dogma. For example, many evolutionary biologists now question whether natural selection alone accounts for the evolutionary history observed in the fossil record.

The study of evolution is livelier than ever, and we will evaluate some of the current debates in the next three chapters. But these questions about how life evolves in no way imply that most biologists consider evolution itself to be "just a theory." Debates about evolutionary theory are like arguments over competing theories about gravity; we know that objects keep right on falling while we debate the cause.

By attributing the diversity of life to natural causes rather than to supernatural creation, Darwin gave biology a sound, scientific basis (FIGURE 22.18). Nevertheless, the diverse products of evolution are elegant and inspiring. As Darwin said in the closing paragraph of The Origin of Species, "There is grandeur in this view of life."

   Natural selection cannot fashion perfect organisms

One obstacle to understanding evolution is the common misconception that individual organisms evolve, in the Darwinian sense, during their lifetimes. In fact, natural selection does act on individuals; their characteristics affect their chances of survival and their reproductive success. But the evolutionary impact of this natural selection is only apparent in tracking how apopulation of organisms changes over time. Consider, for example, representatives from a population of marine snails (Liguus fascitus) in the photograph above. Their different patterns of coloration represent genetic variations within that population. If predators feed preferentially on snails having a particular coloration, then the proportion of individuals with that coloration probably will decline from one generation to the next because such snails will produce fewer offspring. Thus, it is the population, not its individuals, that evolves; some characteristics become more common within the overall population, while other characteristics decline. FIGURE 23.1 (p. 446) illustrates another example of this principle. Evolution on the smallest scale, or microevolution, can be defined as a change in the allele frequencies of a population (see p. 249 to review the definition of alleles). We begin our study of microevolution by tracing how biologists finally began to understand Darwin's theory of natural selection during the first half of the 20th century.

Fig 23-1. Individuals are selected, but populations evolve. The bent grass (Agrostis tenuis) in the foreground is growing on the tailings of an abandoned mine in Wales. These plants tolerate concentrations of heavy metals that are toxic to other plants of the same species growing just meters away, in the pasture on the other side of the fence. Each year, many seeds land on the mine tailings, but most are unable to grow successfully there. The only plants that germinate, grow, and reproduce are those that inherited genes enabling them to tolerate metallic soil. Thus, this adaptation does not evolve by individual plants becoming more metal-tolerant during their lifetimes. We can only see the evolution of this population by observing the proportions of metal-tolerant plants in successive generations.

 The Hardy-Weinberg theorem describes a nonevolving population



The Origin of Species convinced most biologists that species are products of evolution, but Darwin was not nearly so successful in gaining acceptance for his idea that natural selection is the main mechanism of evolution. Natural selection requires hereditary processes that Darwin could not explain. His theory was based on what seems like a paradox of inheritance: Like begets like--but not exactly. What was missing in Darwin's explanations was an understanding of inheritance that could explain how chance variations arise in a population while also accounting for the precise transmission of these variations from parents to offspring. Although Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin were contemporaries, Mendel's discoveries were unappreciated at the time, and apparently no one noticed that he had elucidated the very principles of inheritance that could have resolved Darwin's paradox and given credibility to natural selection.

Adaptive evolution is a blend of chance and sorting--chance in the creation of new genetic variations by mutation and sexual recombination, and sorting in the workings of selection as it favors the propagation of some chance variations over others. From the range of variations available to it, natural selection increases the frequencies of certain genotypes and fits organisms to their environments. In this section, we take a closer look at natural selection as the mechanism of evolutionary adaptation.





 The modern evolutionary synthesis integrated Darwinian selection and Mendelian inheritance

Ironically, when Mendel's research article was rediscovered and reassessed at the beginning of the 20th century, many geneticists believed that the laws of inheritance were at odds with Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin considered the raw material for natural selection to be quantitative characters, those characteristics in a population that vary along a continuum, such as fur length in mammals or the speed with which an animal can flee from a predator. We know today that quantitative characters are influenced by multiple genetic loci. (To review polygenic inheritance and quantitative characters, see Chapter 14.) But Mendel (and later the geneticists of the early 20th century) recognized only discrete "either-or" traits, such as purple or white flowers in pea plants, as heritable. Thus, there seemed to be no genetic basis for natural selection to work on the more subtle variations within a population that were central to Darwin's theory.

An important turning point for evolutionary theory was the birth of population genetics, which emphasizes the extensive genetic variation within populations and recognizes the importance of quantitative characters. With progress in population genetics in the 1930s, Mendelism and Darwinism were reconciled, and the genetic basis of variation and natural selection was worked out.

A comprehensive theory of evolution that became known as the modern synthesis began to take form in the early 1940s. It is called a synthesis because it integrates discoveries and ideas from many different fields, including paleontology, taxonomy, biogeography, and, of course, population genetics. The architects of this modern synthesis included geneticists Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) and Sewall Wright (1889-1988), biogeographer and taxonomist Ernst Mayr (1904-), paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1902-1984), and botanist G. Ledyard Stebbins (1906-2000). The modern synthesis emphasizes the importance of populations as the units of evolution, the central role of natural selection as the most important mechanism of evolution, and the idea of gradualism to explain how large changes can evolve as an accumulation of small changes occurring over long periods of time. No scientific paradigm is likely to endure without modification for half a century. Many evolutionary biologists are now challenging some of the assumptions of the modern synthesis. Still, 20th-century biology has been profoundly affected by the modern synthesis, which has shaped most of our ideas about how populations evolve.





 A population's gene pool is defined by its allele frequencies

A population is a localized group of individuals belonging to the same species. For now, we will define a species as a group of populations whose individuals have the potential to interbreed and produce fertile offspring in nature (this definition will be examined more critically in Chapter 24). Each species is distributed over a certain geographic range, but within this range individuals are usually concentrated in several localized populations. A population may be isolated from other populations of the same species, exchanging genetic material only rarely. Such isolation is particularly common for populations confined to widely separated islands, unconnected lakes, or mountain ranges separated by lowlands. However, populations are not always isolated, nor do they necessarily have sharp boundaries. One dense population center may blur into another in an intermediate region where members of the species occur but are less numerous. Although these populations are not isolated, individuals are still concentrated in centers and are more likely to breed with members of the same population than with members of other populations. Therefore, individuals near a population center are, on average, more closely related to one another than to members of other populations (FIGURE 23.2).

Fig 23-2. Population distribution. (a) Separated by a river bottom, where firs are uncommon, the two Douglas fir populations are not totally isolated. Interbreeding occurs when wind blows pollen between the populations. Nonetheless, trees are more likely to breed with members of the same population than with trees on the other side of the river. (b) This nighttime satellite view of the eastern United States shows the lights of human population centers. People move around the country, of course, but people are more likely to choose mates locally.

The total aggregate of genes in a population at any one time is called the population's gene pool. It consists of all alleles at all gene loci in all individuals of the population. For a diploid species, each locus is represented twice in the genome of an individual, who may be either homozygous or heterozygous for those homologous loci. (Recall that homozygous individuals have two identical alleles for a given character, whereas heterozygous individuals have two different alleles for that character.) If all members of a population are homozygous for the same allele, that allele is said to be fixed in the gene pool. Often, however, there are two or more alleles for a gene, each having a relative frequency (proportion) in the gene pool.

An example will make the concept of allele frequency in a gene pool less abstract. Imagine a wildflower population with two varieties contrasting in flower color. An allele for red flowers, which we will symbolize by R, is completely dominant to an allele for white flowers, symbolized by r. For our simplified situation, these are the only two alleles for this locus in the population. Suppose an imaginary population has 500 plants, and 20 of these plants have white flowers because they are homozygous for the recessive allele; their genotype is rr. The other 480 plants have red flowers; some of them will be homozygous (RR) and others will be heterozygous (Rr). Suppose that 320 plants are RR homozygotes and 160 are Rr heterozygotes. Because these are diploid organisms, there are a total of 1,000 copies of genes for flower color in the population of 500 individuals. The dominant allele (R) accounts for 800 of these genes (320 &#160;X&#160; 2 = 640 for RR plants, plus 160 &#160;X&#160; 1 = 160 for Rr individuals). Thus, the frequency of the R allele in the gene pool of this population is 800/1,000 = 0.8 = 80% . And because there are only two allelic forms of the gene, the r allele must have a frequency of 0.2, or 20% .





 The Hardy-Weinberg theorem describes a nonevolving population

Before we consider the mechanisms that cause a population to evolve, it will be helpful to examine, for comparison, the gene pool of a nonevolving population. Such a gene pool is described by the Hardy-Weinberg theorem, named for the two scientists who derived the principle independently in 1908. The theorem states that the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population's gene pool remain constant over the generations unless acted upon by agents other than Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles. Put another way, the shuffling of alleles due to meiosis and random fertilization has no effect on the overall gene pool of a population.

To apply the Hardy-Weinberg theorem, let's return to our imaginary wildflower population of 500 plants (FIGURE 23.3a, p. 448). Recall that 80%  (0.8) of the flower-color loci in the gene pool have the R allele and 20%  (0.2) have the r allele. How will meiosis during sexual reproduction affect the frequencies of the two alleles in the next generation of our wildflower population? We will assume that the union of sperm and ova in the population is completely random; that is, all male-female mating combinations are equally likely. The situation is analogous to mixing all gametes in a sack and then drawing them randomly, two at a time, to determine the genotype for each zygote (fertilized egg). Each gamete has one allele for flower color, and the allele frequencies of the gametes will be the same as the allele frequencies in the parent population. Every time a gamete is drawn from the pool at random, the chance that the gamete will bear an R allele is 0.8, and the chance that the gamete will have an r allele is 0.2.

Fig 23-3. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem. The gene pool of a nonevolving population remains constant over the generations; Mendelian segregation alone will not alter the relative frequencies of alleles or genotypes. In this example (a hypothetical flower population), note that the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remain the same between one generation (a) and the next generation (b).

Using the rule of multiplication (see Chapter 14), we can cal culate the frequencies of the three possible genotypes in the next generation of the population (FIGURE 23.3b). The probability of picking two R alleles from the pool of gametes is 0.8 &#160;X&#160; 0.8 = 0.64. Thus, about 64%  of the plants in the next generation will have the genotype RR. The frequency of rr individuals will be about 0.04 (0.2 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.04), or 4% . And 32% , or 0.32, of the plants will be heterozygous--that is, Rr or rR, depending on whether it is the sperm or ovum that supplies the dominant allele (frequency of Rr = 0.8 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.16; frequency of rR = 0.2 &#160;X&#160; 0.8 = 0.16; frequency of Rr + rR = 0.32).

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Notice in FIGURE 23.3 that the sexual processes of meiosis and random fertilization have maintained the same allele and genotype frequencies that existed in the previous generation of the wildflower population. For the flower-color locus, the population's gene pool is in a state of equilibrium--referred to as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Theoretically, the allele frequencies could remain constant at 0.8 for R and 0.2 for r forever (though in reality, some other factor always intervenes). The Hardy-Weinberg theorem describes how the Mendelian system has no tendency to alter allele frequencies. For instance, the dominant allele (R) has no tendency to increase in frequency from one generation to the next relative to the recessive allele (r). The system operates somewhat like shuffling a deck of cards: No matter how many times the deck is reshuffled to deal out new hands, the deck itself remains the same. Aces do not grow more numerous than jacks. And the repeated shuffling of a population's gene pool over the generations cannot, in itself, increase the frequency of one allele relative to another.

The Hardy-Weinberg Equation

We can use our imaginary wildflower population to describe the Hardy-Weinberg theorem in more general terms. We will restrict our analysis to the simplest case of only two alleles, one dominant over the other. However, the Hardy-Weinberg theorem also applies to situations in which there are three or more alleles for a particular locus and no clear-cut dominance.

For a gene locus where only two alleles occur in a population, population geneticists use the letter p to represent the frequency of one allele and the letter q to represent the frequency of the other allele. In our imaginary wildflower population, p = 0.8 and q = 0.2 (see FIGURE 23.3). Note that p + q = 1; the combined frequencies of all possible alleles must add to 100%  for that locus in the population. If there are only two alleles and we know the frequency of one, the frequency of the other can be calculated:

If p + q = 1 then p = 1 - q and q = 1 - p

When gametes combine their alleles to form zygotes, the probability of generating an RR genotype is p2 (an application of the rule of multiplication). In our wildflower population, p = 0.8, and p = 0.64, the probability of an R sperm fertilizing an R ovum to produce an RR zygote. The frequency of individuals homozygous for the other allele (rr) is q2, or 0.2 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.04 for the wildflower population. There are two ways in which an Rr genotype can arise, depending on which parent contributes the dominant allele. Therefore, the frequency of heterozygous individuals in the population is 2pq (2 &#160;X&#160; 0.8 &#160;X&#160; 0.2 = 0.32 in our example). If we have included all possible genotypes, the genotype frequencies add up to 1:

p2+2pq+q2=1Frequency of RR genotypeFrequency of Rr plus rR genotypeFrequency of rr genotypeFor our wildflowers, this is 0.64+0.32+0.04=1.

Population geneticists refer to this general formula as the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The equation enables us to calculate frequencies of alleles in a gene pool if we know frequencies of genotypes, and vice versa.

Population Genetics and Health Science

We can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to estimate the percentage of the human population that carries the allele for a particular inherited disease. For instance, one out of approximately 10,000 babies in the United States is born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that, left untreated, results in mental retardation and other problems. (Newborn babies are now routinely tested for PKU, and symptoms can be prevented by following a strict diet.) The disease is caused by a recessive allele; thus, the frequency of individuals in the U.S. population born with PKU corresponds to q2 in the Hardy-Weinberg equation (q2 = frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype). Given one PKU occurrence per 10,000 births, q2 = 0.0001. Therefore, assuming Hardy-Weinberg proportions, the frequency of the recessive allele for PKU in the population is  and the frequency of the dominant allele is  The frequency of carriers, heterozygous people who do not have PKU but may pass the PKU allele on to offspring, is  Thus, about 2%  of the U.S. population carries the PKU allele.

The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem and Genetic Variation

The Hardy-Weinberg theorem is important conceptually and historically because it shows how Mendel's theory of inheritance plugs a hole in Darwin's theory of natural selection. Natural selection requires genetic variation; it cannot act in a genetically uniform population. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem explains how Mendelian inheritance preserves genetic variation from one generation to the next. Pre-Mendelian theories of inheritance were mainly "blending" theories, in which the hereditary factors in the offspring were thought to be a blend of the hereditary factors inherited from the two parents. If a red flower mates with a white one, blending theory predicts that the offspring will be a paler red and will now have hereditary factors for this paler red color. Genetic variation has been eliminated, since the two kinds of factors in the parents have been reduced to only one kind in the offspring. Such a hereditary mechanism would soon produce a uniform population. In Mendelian inheritance, however, the hereditary mechanism has no tendency by itself to reduce genetic variation. The set of alleles inherited by each generation from its parents are in turn passed on when that generation breeds. This nonblending mechanism of inheritance preserves the genetic variation upon which natural selection acts.

The Assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg Theorem

For a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it must satisfy five main conditions:

Very large population size. In a population of finite size, especially if that size is small, genetic drift, which is chance fluctuation in the gene pool, can cause genotype frequencies to change over time.

No migration. Gene flow, the transfer of alleles between populations due to the movement of individuals or gametes, can increase the frequency of any genotype that is in high frequency among the immigrants.

No net mutations. By changing one allele into another, mutations alter the gene pool.

Random mating. If individuals pick mates with certain genotypes, then the random mixing of gametes required for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium does not occur.

No natural selection. Differential survival and reproductive success of genotypes will alter their frequencies and may cause a detectable deviation from frequencies predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equation.



Thus, we do not really expect a natural population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. And a deviation from the stability of a gene pool--and from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium--usually results in evolution.





 Microevolution is a generation-to-generation change in a population's allele frequencies

The Hardy-Weinberg theorem is useful when we are studying evolution because it provides a baseline against which we can compare the allele and genotype frequencies of an evolving population. If the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from values predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equation, it is usually because the population is evolving.

We can now refine our definition of evolution at the population level: Evolution is a generation-to-generation change in a population's frequencies of alleles. Because such change in a gene pool is evolution on the smallest scale, it is referred to more specifically as microevolution.

Microevolution is occurring even if the frequencies of alleles are changing for only a single genetic locus. If we track allele and genotype frequencies in a population over a succession of generations, some loci may be at equilibrium while allele frequencies at other loci are changing. Such a population is evolving. For example, our imaginary wildflower population would be evolving if the frequencies of the red-flower and white-flower alleles were changing from generation to generation, even if Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium were maintained for all other genetic loci.





 The two main causes of microevolution are genetic drift and natural selection

The main factors that can act to alter the allele frequencies in a population are genetic drift, natural selection, gene flow, and mutation. Of these four, genetic drift and natural selection are more important, but we will look at mutation and gene flow as well. We will see that all four of these causes of microevolution represent departures from the conditions required for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. (We will not consider departures from the Hardy-Weinberg assumption of random mating; non-random mating can affect the relative frequencies of homozygous versus heterozygous genotypes, but often has no effect on allele frequencies.)

Natural selection is the only cause of microevolution that generally adapts a population to its environment. The other agents of microevolution may affect populations in positive, negative, or neutral ways. Natural selection always has a positive effect, because selection favors the disproportionate propagation of favorable traits.

Genetic Drift

Flip a coin 1,000 times, and a result of 700 heads and 300 tails would make you very suspicious about that coin. But flip a coin ten times, and an outcome of seven heads and three tails would seem within reason. The smaller the sample, the greater the chance of deviation from an idealized result--an equal number of heads and tails, in the case of a sample of coin tosses. This deviation from the expected result, due to the sample size being finite in size rather than infinite, is called sampling error.

Let's apply coin toss logic to a population's gene pool. If a new generation draws its alleles at random from the previous generation, then the larger the population (the sample size), the more closely the new generation will represent the gene pool of the previous generation. Thus, one requirement for a gene pool to maintain the status quo--Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium--is a large population size (actually infinitely large, an ideal never met). The gene pool of a small population may not be accurately represented in the next generation because of sampling error. It is analogous to the erratic outcome from a small sample of coin tosses.

FIGURE 23.4 applies this concept of sampling error to a small population of wildflowers. Chance causes the frequencies of the alleles for red (R) and white (r) flowers to change over the generations. And that change fits our definition of microevolution. This evolutionary mechanism, a change in a population's allele frequencies due to chance, is called genetic drift. Two situations that can shrink populations down to a small size -- small enough for genetic drift to have large effects -- are known as the bottleneck effect and the founder effect.

Fig 23-4. Genetic drift. This small wildflower population has a stable size of only ten plants. For generation 1, only the five boxed plants produce fertile offspring. Only two plants of generation 2 manage to leave fertile offspring. Over the generations, genetic drift can completely eliminate some alleles, as is the case for the r allele in generation 3 of this imaginary population.

The Bottleneck Effect. Disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, and fires may reduce the size of a population drastically. The small surviving population may not be representative of the original population's gene pool. By chance, certain alleles will be overrepresented among the survivors. Other alleles will be underrepresented. And some al leles may be eliminated altogether. Genetic drift may continue to change the gene pool for many generations until the population is again large enough for sampling errors to be less significant. The analogy in FIGURE 23.5 illustrates why genetic drift due to a drastic reduction in population size is called the bottleneck effect.

Fig 23-5. The bottleneck effect: an analogy. Shaking just a few of the marbles through the bottleneck is like drastically reducing the size of a population following some environmental disaster. By chance, blue marbles are overrepresented in the new population, and gold marbles are absent. Similarly, bottlenecking a population of organisms tends to reduce variability.

Bottlenecking usually reduces the overall genetic variability in a population because at least some alleles are likely to be lost from the gene pool. An important example of this concept is the potential loss of individual variation, and hence adaptability, in bottlenecked populations of endangered species, such as the cheetah. The fastest of all running animals, cheetahs are magnificent cats that were once widespread in Africa and Asia. Like many African mammals, their numbers fell drastically during the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago. At that time, the species may have suffered a severe bottleneck, possibly as a result of disease, human hunting, and periodic droughts. Some researchers think that the South African cheetah population suffered a second bottleneck during the 19th century when South African farmers hunted the animals to near extinction. Today, only three small populations of cheetahs exist in the wild. Genetic variability in these populations is very low compared to populations of other mammals. In fact, genetic uniformity in cheetahs rivals that of highly inbred varieties of laboratory mice!

The Founder Effect. Genetic drift is also likely whenever a few individuals from a larger population colonize an isolated island, lake, or some other new habitat. The smaller the sample size, the less the genetic makeup of the colonists will represent the gene pool of the larger population they left. The most extreme case would be the founding of a new population by one pregnant animal or a single plant seed. If the colony is successful, genetic drift will continue to affect the frequency of alleles in the gene pool until the population is large enough for sampling errors from generation to generation to be minimal. Genetic drift in a new colony is known as the founder effect.

The founder effect probably accounts for the relatively high frequency of certain inherited disorders among human populations established by a small number of colonists. In 1814, 15 people founded a British colony on Tristan da Cunha, a group of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean midway between Africa and South America. Apparently, one of the colonists carried a recessive allele for retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals. Of the 240 descendants who still lived on the island in the late 1960s, four had retinitis pigmentosa, and at least nine others were known to be carriers, based on pedigree analysis. The frequency of this allele is much higher on Tristan da Cunha than in the populations from which the founders came. In addition to inherited diseases, the founder effect also alters the frequencies of many alleles that affect more subtle characteristics.

Natural Selection

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires that all individuals in a population be equal in their ability to survive and produce viable, fertile offspring. This condition is probably never completely met. Populations consist of varied individuals, with some variants leaving more offspring than others. This differential success in reproduction is what Darwin meant by natural selection. Selection results in alleles being passed along to the next generation in numbers disproportionate to their relative frequencies in the present generation. One possible cause of such a disproportion might be differential survival. For example, in our imaginary wildflower population, perhaps white flowers (rr) are more visible to herbivorous insects, so that more white flowers are eaten. Plants with red flowers (RR or Rr) would therefore have more opportunity to produce offspring. Selection can also affect reproductive success more directly. For example, red flowers may be more effective than white ones in attracting the pollinators required for seed production. This difference would disturb Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the frequency of the R allele would increase in the gene pool, and the frequency of the r allele would decline.

Of all the agents of microevolution that change a gene pool, only selection is likely to adapt a population to its environment. Natural selection accumulates and maintains favorable genotypes in a population.

Natural selection and genetic drift cause most of the changes in allele frequencies that we observe in evolving populations. However, allele frequencies can also be changed by migration between populations or by mutation, and in some cases these factors are important.

Gene Flow

A population may gain or lose alleles by gene flow, genetic exchange due to the migration of fertile individuals or gametes between populations. Perhaps, for example, a population near our hypothetical wildflower population consists entirely of white-flowered individuals (rr). A windstorm may blow pollen from the rr population to our wildflower population, and allele frequencies may change in the next generation.

Gene flow tends to reduce differences between populations. If it is extensive enough, gene flow can eventually amalgamate neighboring populations into a single population with a common gene pool. As humans began to move about the world more freely, gene flow undoubtedly became an important agent of microevolutionary change in populations that were previously quite isolated (FIGURE 23.6).

Fig 23-6. Gene flow and human evolution. The migration of people throughout the world is transferring alleles between populations that were once isolated. This magazine cover celebrates America's changing gene pools and culture with a computer-generated image blending facial features from several immigrant groups.

Mutation

A mutation is a change in an organism's DNA (see Chapter17). A new mutation that is transmitted in gametes can immediately change the gene pool of a population by substituting one allele for another. For any one gene locus, mutation alone does not have much quantitative effect on a large population in a single generation, because a mutation at any given gene locus is a very rare event. If some new allele produced by mutation increases its frequency by a significant amount in a population, it is not because mutation is generating the allele in abundance, but because individuals carrying the mutant allele are producing a disproportionate number of offspring as a result of natural selection or genetic drift.

Although mutations at a particular gene locus are rare, the cumulative impact of mutations at all loci can be significant. This is because each individual has thousands of genes, and many populations have thousands or millions of individuals. Certainly over the long term, mutation is, in itself, very important to evolution because it is the original source of the genetic variation that serves as raw material for natural selection.





 Genetic variation occurs within and between populations

You have no trouble recognizing your friends in a crowd. Each person has a unique genome, reflected in individual variations of appearance and temperament. lndividual variation occurs in populations of all species of sexually reproducing organisms. We are very conscious of human diversity. We are generally less sensitive to individuality in populations of other animals and of plants, and the diversity may escape our notice because the variations are subtle. But these slight differences between individuals in a population are the variations Darwin wrote most about as the raw material for natural selection. And in addition to the differences we can see, populations have extensive variation that can only be observed at the molecular level. For example, you cannot tell a person's ABO blood group (A, B, AB, or O) just by looking at him or her.

Not all the variation we observe in a population is heritable. Phenotype is the cumulative product of an inherited genotype and a multitude of environmental influences. For example, bodybuilders alter their phenotypes dramatically. FIGURE 23.7 illustrates a striking example of environmentally induced variation in a butterfly population. It is important to remember that only the genetic component of variation can have evolutionary consequences as a result of natural selection, because it is the only component that transcends generations.

Fig 23-7. A nonheritable difference within a population. These two European insects, called map butterflies (Araschnia levana), are seasonal forms of the same species: (a)Individuals that emerge in the spring are orange and brown; (b) individuals that emerge in late summer are black and white. Seasonal differences in hormones are responsible for these different phenotypes; the two forms you see here are genetically identical at the loci for coloration. Therefore, if these two forms differed in survival and fertility, that in itself would not lead to any change in the frequencies of the two phenotypes in the next generation.

Variation Within Populations

Both quantitative and discrete characters contribute to variation within a population. Most heritable variation consists of quantitative characters that vary along a continuum within a population. For example, plant height may vary continuously in our hypothetical wildflower population, from very short individuals to very tall individuals and everything in between. Quantitative variation usually indicates polygenic inheritance, an additive effect of two or more genes on a single phenotypic character (see Chapter 14). Discrete characters, such as red versus white flowers, can be classified on an either-or basis, usually because they are determined by a single gene locus with different alleles that affect distinct phenotypes.

Polymorphism. When two or more forms of a discrete character are represented in a population, the different forms are called morphs--as in the red-flowered and white-flowered morphs of our wildflower population. A population is said to be polymorphic for a character if two or more distinct morphs are each represented in high enough frequencies to be readily noticeable. (Obviously, this definition is arbitrary, but a population is not considered polymorphic if it consists almost exclusively of a single morph, with other morphs extremely rare.) Look again at the photo on page 445 to see a striking example of polymorphism in a snail population. Polymorphism is extensive in human populations, both in physical characters, such as the presence or absence of freckles, and in biochemical characters, such as ABO blood groups (for which there are four morphs: type A, type B, type AB, and type O). Polymorphism applies only to discrete characters, not to characters such as human height, which varies among people in a continuum.

Measuring Genetic Variation. Population geneticists measure genetic variation at both the level of whole genes (gene diversity) and at the molecular level of DNA (nucleotide diversity). Let's consider a population of fruit flies (Drosophila). The genome of a fruit fly has about 13,000 loci. The gene diversity of Drosophila is the average percent of these loci that are heterozygous. On average, a fruit fly is homozygous (has two matching alleles) at about 86%  of its loci. In other words, the flies, on average, are heterozygous (have two different alleles) at about 14%  of their gene loci. We would therefore say that the fly population has a gene diversity of 14% , meaning that fruit flies are heterozygous at about 1,800 of their 13,000 gene loci and homozygous at all the rest.

Population geneticists measure nucleotide diversity by comparing the nucleotide sequences of DNA samples from two individuals and then pooling the data from many such comparisons of two individuals. The fruit fly genome has about 180 million nucleotides, and researchers have measured a nucleotide diversity in a population of about 1% . In other words, on average, two flies from the same population have different nucleotides at about 1.8 million nucleotide sites in their DNA.

Population geneticists have also measured gene diversity and nucleotide diversity in humans. It turns out that we have relatively little genetic variation compared to most other species. Gene diversity is 14%  in humans, about the same as in fruit flies. But nucleotide diversity is only about 0.1%  in humans, a tenth of the diversity found in fruit fly populations. You and your neighbor have the same nucleotide at 999 out of every 1,000 nucleotide sites in your DNA. We are clearly much more genetically alike than we are different. Still, this is enough genetic variation to account for the hereditary component of the enormous individuality we notice in how people look and act (not to mention the biochemical differences, such as blood group, that are not outwardly visible).

Variation Between Populations

Most species exhibit geographic variation, differences in gene pools between populations or subgroups of populations. Because at least some environmental factors are likely to be different from one place to another, natural selection can contribute to geographic variation. For example, perhaps one population of our now-familiar wildflower species has a higher frequency of recessive alleles at the flower-color locus than other populations because of a local prevalence of pollinators that prefer white flowers (recessive homozygotes). Genetic drift can also cause chance variations among different populations.

Geographic variation can also occur on a more local scale--that is, within a population--either because the environment has patchlike diversity or because the population is differentiated into subpopulations resulting from the limited dispersal of individuals.

One particular type of geographic variation, called a cline, is a graded change in some trait along a geographic axis. In some cases, a cline may represent a graded region of overlap where individuals of neighboring populations are interbreeding. In other cases, a gradation in some environmental variable may produce a cline. For example, the average body size of many North American species of birds and mammals increases gradually with increasing latitude. Presumably, the reduced ratio of surface area to volume that accompanies larger size is an adaptation that helps animals conserve body heat in cold environments. Experimental studies of some clines confirm the role of genetic variation--rather than strictly environmental effects--in the spatial differences of phenotype (FIGURE 23.8).

Fig 23-8. Clinal variation in a plant. Average size of yarrow plants (Achillea) growing on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains gradually decreases with increasing elevation. Although the environment affects growth rates directly to some extent, some of the variation has a genetic basis. Researchers collected seeds at different elevations and grew plants in a common garden; the average sizes of the plants were correlated with the altitude at which the seeds were collected.

In contrast to a cline, with its gradation of some characteristic, geographic variation between isolated populations often consists of discrete differences. FIGURE 23.9 illustrates one example, a study of geographic variation in house mice reported by researchers in 2000.

Fig 23-9. Geographic variation between isolated populations of house mice. When the Portuguese first settled the small Atlantic island of Madeira during the 15th century, they inadvertently brought house mice (Mus musculus) with them. Because of the mountains that separated many of the early Portuguese settlements, several populations of the mice have evolved in isolation from one another. Today, differences can be seen in the karyotypes (chromosome sets) of some of these isolated populations. For example, researchers have found that various chromosomes in the Madeira populations are fused, reducing the chromosome count from the species' standard diploid chromosome number of 20 (2n = 20). However, the pattern of fusion in one mouse population is different from the pattern of fusion in another. Mice that live in the areas indicated by the gold dots have the karyotype shown at the top of the figure; mice in the locales with the red dots have the lower karyotype. This geographic variation in karyotypes is probably due mainly to genetic drift.





 Mutation and sexual recombination generate genetic variation

Two random processes, mutation and sexual recombination (see Chapter 15), create variation in the gene pool of a population.

Mutation

New alleles originate only by mutation, or change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. A mutation affecting any gene locus is an accident that is rare and random. Most mutations occur in somatic cells and are lost when the individual dies. Only muta tions that occur in cell lines that produce gametes can be passed along to offspring.

A mutation is like a shot in the dark: Chance determines where it will strike and how it will alter a gene. Most point mutations, those affecting a single base in DNA, are probably relatively harmless. Much of the DNA in the eukaryotic genome does not code for protein products, and it is uncertain how a change of a single nucleotide base in this silent DNA will affect the well-being of the organism. Even mutations of structural genes, which do code for proteins, may occur with little or no effect on the organism, partly because of redundancy in the genetic code. Of course, a single point mutation can have a significant impact on phenotype, as in sickle-cell disease, for example (see FIGURE 5.19).

A mutation that alters a protein enough to affect its function is more often harmful than beneficial. Organisms are the refined products of thousands of generations of past selection, and a random change is not likely to improve the genome any more than blindly firing a gunshot through the hood of a car is likely to improve engine performance. On rare occasions, however, a mutant allele may actually fit its bearer to the environment better and enhance the reproductive success of the individual. This is not especially likely in a stable environment but becomes more probable when the environment is changing and mutations that were once selected against are now favorable under the new conditions. For example, mutations that happen to endow HIV with resistance to antiviral drugs also slow the reproductive rate of the virus (see Chapter 22). Once the drugs were in the environment, the mutant alleles were favored, and natural selection increased their frequency in HIV populations.

Chromosomal mutations that disrupt many gene loci are almost certain to have negative effects on the development of the organism. However, when chromosomal rearrangements leave genes intact, their effects on organisms may be neutral, as in FIGURE 23.9. Rearrangements of chromosomes may in rare instances bring benefits. For example, the translocation of a chromosomal piece could link alleles that affect the organism in some positive way when they are inherited together as a package.

Duplications of chromosome segments, like other chromosomal mutations, are nearly always harmful. But if the repeated segment does not disrupt genetic balance severely, it can persist over the generations and provide an expanded genome with superfluous loci that may eventually take on new functions by mutation. New genes may also arise from transpositions of existing DNA sequences or by the shuffling of exons within the genome, either within a single locus or between loci (see Chapter 19).

In microorganisms with very short generation spans, mutation generates genetic variation very rapidly. For example, HIV has a generation span of about two days. In an AIDS patient, the HIV infection produces 1010 or more new viruses per day. Each replication provides a chance for errors--mutations--to occur. In addition, HIV has an RNA genome, which has a much higher mutation rate than DNA genomes. The combined mutation and replication rates mean that in a single day, the HIV population in one human body will generate mutations in every site in the HIV genome. For this reason, single-drug treatments will probably never be effective for long against HIV. Even double-drug treatments are rarely effective for long, because individual viruses with double mutations conferring resistance to both drugs arise daily. This explains why the most effective AIDS treatments are drug "cocktails," combinations of several drugs. Compared to single and double mutations, it is far less probable that multiple mutations against all the drugs will turn up in individual viruses in a short time period.

Bacterial populations can also evolve rapidly by the explosive asexual expansion of mutant clones favored by the local environment. However, on a generation-to-generation time scale, animals and plants depend mainly on sexual recombination for the genetic variation that makes adaptation possible.

Sexual Recombination

Members of a sexually reproducing population owe nearly all their genetic differences to the unique recombinations of existing alleles each individual receives from the gene pool. (Of course, this allele variation has its ultimate basis in past mutations.)

Sex shuffles alleles and deals them at random to determine individual genotypes. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes, one inherited from each parent, trade some of their genes by crossing over, and then the homologous chromosomes and the alleles they carry segregate randomly into separate gametes. Gametes from one individual vary extensively in their genetic makeup, and each zygote made by a mating pair has a unique assortment of alleles resulting from the random union of a sperm and an ovum (see Chapter 13). A population, of course, contains a vast number of possible mating combinations, each bringing together the gametes of individuals that are likely to have different genetic backgrounds. Sexual reproduction recombines old alleles into fresh assortments every generation.





 Diploidy and balanced polymorphism preserve variation

What prevents natural selection from extinguishing a population's variation by culling unfavorable genotypes? The tendency for natural selection to reduce variation is countered by mechanisms that preserve or restore variation.

Diploidy

The diploid nature of most eukaryotes hides a considerable amount of genetic variation from selection in the form of recessive alleles in heterozygotes. Recessive alleles that are less favorable than their dominant counterparts, or even harmful in the present environment, can persist in a population through their propagation by heterozygous individuals. This latent variation is exposed to selection only when both parents carry the same recessive allele and combine two copies in one zygote. This happens only rarely if the frequency of the recessive allele is very low. The rarer the recessive allele, the greater the degree of protection from natural selection. Heterozygote protection maintains a huge pool of alleles that may not be suitable for present conditions but that could bring new benefits when the environment changes.

Balanced Polymorphism

Selection itself may preserve variation at some gene loci. This ability of natural selection to maintain stable frequencies of two or more phenotypic forms in a population is called balanced polymorphism. Natural selection preserves variation by two mechanisms. One such mechanism is heterozygote advantage. If individuals who are heterozygous at a particular locus have greater survivorship and reproductive success than any type of homozygote, then two or more alleles will be maintained at that locus by natural selection.

An example of heterozygote advantage is seen at the locus in humans for one chain of hemoglobin, the protein of red blood cells that transports oxygen. A specific recessive allele at that locus causes sickle-cell disease in homozygous individuals (see FIGURE 5.19 and FIGURE 14.15). Heterozygotes, however, are resistant to malaria, an important advantage in tropical regions, where that disease is a major cause of death. The environment in these regions favors the heterozygotes over homozygous dominant individuals, who are susceptible to malaria, and homozygous recessive individuals, who are harmed by sickle-cell disease. The frequency of the sickle-cell allele in Africa is generally highest in areas where the malaria parasite is most com mon (FIGURE 23.10). In some tribes, the recessive allele accounts for 20%  of the hemoglobin loci in the gene pool, a very high frequency for an allele that is disastrous in homozygotes. But at this frequency (q =0.2), 32%  of the population consists of heterozygotes resistant to malaria (2pq), and only 4%  of the population suffers from sickle-cell disease (q2).

A second mechanism promoting balanced polymorphism is frequency-dependent selection, in which the survival and reproduction of any one morph declines if that phenotypic form becomes too common in the population. The relationships between parasites and their hosts may involve such frequency-dependent selection. Internal parasites generally recognize cells of their hosts by binding specifically to receptor molecules on the host cells. Imagine a host population with variation in receptor molecules for a particular parasite. Let's say that an individual host has either receptor A or receptor B on its cells. If the parasite recognizes receptor A as a signal to penetrate host cells, then natural selection will favor those individuals in the host population that have receptor B--the individuals less susceptible to infection by this parasite. The frequency of individuals with B receptors increases in the population. But the parasite population is also evolving by natural selection. Parasites that recognize what is now the most frequent variant of hosts, those with the B receptor, become favored and their frequency increases. This adaptation stimulates a new counteradaptation of the host population, with individuals having the A receptor again gaining advantage. The teeter-totter effect of frequency-dependent selection helps maintain a repertoire of variants in populations. In the year 2000, researchers reported an example of such frequency-dependent selection in populations of snails infected by a parasitic worm (FIGURE 23.11).

Fig 23-11. Frequency-dependent selection in a host-parasite relationship. The bar graph compares the rates at which a parasitic worm infects five different clones that researchers collected from Lake Porerua in New Zealand. (This snail population exists as diverse clones because the snails reproduce asexually.) Infection rates are higher for common clones than for a less common clone, suggesting that frequency-dependent selection helps maintain polymorphism in the snail population.

Neutral Variation

Some of the genetic variations observed in populations are probably trivial in their impact on reproductive success. The diversity of human fingerprints is an example of what is called neutral variation, which seems to confer no selective advantage for some individuals over others. Much of the protein and DNA variation detectable by methods such as electrophoresis may represent chemical "fingerprints" that are neutral in their adaptive qualities. The relative frequencies of neutral variations will not be affected by natural selection; some neutral alleles will increase in the gene pool and others will decrease by the chance effects of genetic drift.

There is no consensus among evolutionary biologists on how much genetic variation is neutral or even if any variation can be considered truly neutral. Variations that appear to be neutral may in fact influence survival and reproductive success in ways that are difficult to measure. It is possible to show that a particular allele is detrimental, but it is impossible to demonstrate that an allele brings no benefits at all to an organism. Furthermore, a variation may be neutral in one environment but not in another. We can never know the degree to which genetic variation is neutral. But we can be certain that even if only a fraction of the extensive variation in a gene pool significantly affects the organisms, that is still an enormous reservoir of raw material for natural selection and the adaptive evolution it causes.





 Evolutionary fitness is the relative contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation

The phrases "struggle for existence" and "survival of the fittest" are misleading if we take them to mean direct competitive contests among individuals. There are animal species in which individuals, usually the males, lock horns or otherwise do combat to determine mating privilege. But reproductive success is generally more subtle and passive. A barnacle may produce more eggs than its neighbors because it is more efficient at collecting food from the water. In a population of moths, certain variants may average more offspring than others because their body and wing colors hide them from predators better. Plants in a wildflower population may differ in reproductive success because some are better able to attract pollinators, owing to slight variations in flower color, shape, or fragrance. These examples point to a biological definition of fitness: Darwinian fitness is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation relative to the contributions of other individuals.

In a more quantitative approach to natural selection, population geneticists define relative fitness as the contribution of a genotype to the next generation compared to the contributions of alternative genotypes for the same locus. For example, consider our wildflower population, in which RR and Rr plants have red flowers and rr plants have white flowers. Let's assume that, on average, individuals with red flowers produce more offspring than those with white flowers. The relative fitness of the most reproductively successful variants is set at 1 as a basis for comparison; so in this case, the relative fitness of an RR or Rr plant is 1. If plants with white flowers average only 80%  as many offspring, their relative fitness is 0.8.

Survival alone does not guarantee reproductive success. Relative fitness is zero for a sterile plant or animal, even if it is robust and outlives other members of the population. But, of course, survival is a prerequisite for reproducing, and longevity increases fitness if it results in certain individuals leaving more descendants than other individuals leave. Then again, an individual that matures quickly and becomes fertile at an early age may have a greater reproductive potential than individuals that live longer but mature late. Thus, many factors that affect both survival and fertility determine an individual's evolutionary fitness.

An organism exposes its phenotype--its physical traits, metabolism, physiology, and behavior--not its genotype, to the environment. Acting on phenotypes, selection indirectly adapts a population to its environment by increasing or maintaining favorable genotypes in the gene pool.

The entity subjected to natural selection is the whole or ganism, which is an integrated composite of its many phenotypic features, not a collage of individual parts. Thus, the relative fitness of an allele depends on the entire genetic context in which it works. For example, alleles that enhance the growth of the trunk and limbs of a tree may be useless or even detrimental in the absence of alleles at other loci that enhance the growth of roots required to support the tree. On the other hand, alleles that contribute nothing to an organism's success, or may even be slightly maladaptive, may be perpetuated because they are present in individuals whose overall fitness is high. The whole baseball team wins the league pennant, even the player with the worst batting average and the most errors.





 The effect of selection on a varying characteristic can be directional, diversifying, or stabilizing

Natural selection can affect the frequency of a heritable trait in a population in three different ways, depending on which phenotypes in a varying population are favored. These three selection trends are directional selection, diversifying selection, and stabilizing selection (FIGURE 23.12).

Fig 23-12. Modes of selection. These cases describe the possible microevolution of an imaginary deer mouse population in which there is quantitative variation in fur coloration from light to dark. The graphs show how the frequencies of individuals of varying darkness change over time. The large arrows symbolize natural selection working against certain phenotypes.

Directional selection is most common during periods of environmental change or when members of a population mi grate to some new habitat with different environmental conditions. Directional selection shifts the frequency curve for variations in some phenotypic character in one direction or the other by favoring what are initially relatively rare individuals that deviate from the average for that character. For instance, fossil evidence indicates that the average size of black bears in Europe increased with each glacial period of the ice ages, only to decrease again during the warmer interglacial periods. Over much shorter time intervals, Peter and Rosemary Grant documented directional evolution of beak size in a population of finches on Daphne Major in the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands (see interview on pages 426 -427). The medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) uses its strong beak to crush seeds. Given a choice of small seeds or large seeds, the birds eat mostly small ones, which are easier to crush. During wet years, small seeds are produced in such abundance that ground finches consume relatively few large seeds. However, during dry years all seeds are in short supply, and the birds eat proportionally more large seeds. This change in diet is correlated with a change in the average depth (top-to-bottom dimension) of the birds' beaks in the subsequent generation. This trait is inherited rather than acquired (by exercising the beak on large seeds, for example). The most likely explanation is that those birds that happen to have stronger beaks have a feeding advantage and so have greater reproductive success during droughts. Thus, they pass the genes for thicker beaks on to their offspring (FIGURE 23.13).

Diversifying selection occurs when environmental conditions are varied in a way that favors individuals on both extremes of a phenotypic range over intermediate phenotypes (FIGURE 23.14).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 23-14. Diversifying selection in a finch population. Two distinctly different beak sizes occur in a single population of black-bellied seedcrackers, a species of finch that lives in Cameroon, West Africa. Small-billed individuals (left) feed mainly on soft seeds, whereas large-billed birds specialize in cracking hard seeds. A reasonable hypothesis is that natural selection selects against intermediate-sized bills, which crack both classes of seeds relatively inefficiently.

Stabilizing selection acts against extreme phenotypes and favors the more common intermediate variants. This mode of selection reduces variation and maintains the status quo for a particular phenotypic character. For example, stabilizing selection keeps the majority of human birth weights in the range of 3 - 4 kg. For babies much smaller or larger than this, infant mortality is greater.

Although we refer to these three selection trends as "modes of selection," the basic mechanism of natural selection is the same for each case. Selection favors certain heritable traits via differential reproductive success.





 Natural selection maintains sexual reproduction

Sex is an evolutionary enigma. It is far inferior to asexual reproduction as measured by reproductive output. Consider, for example, a population of insects in which half the females reproduce only sexually and half reproduce only asexually. Even if both types of females produced the same number of offspring each generation, the asexual condition would increase in frequency because all of the females' offspring would be daughters that would themselves produce more reproductive daughters. In contrast, half of the offspring of the sexual females would be males, which would be required for reproduction but would themselves produce no offspring. FIGURE 23.15(p. 460) diagrams this "twofold disadvantage" of sex.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 23-15. The two-fold disadvantage of sex. These diagrams contrast the reproductive output of females (blue circles) over four generations for asexual versus sexual reproduction. In the sexual version, males, which do not produce offspring, are symbolized by the white circles. (The diagrams assume two offspring per female.)

Clearly, sex confers some benefit in addition to reproduction; otherwise, sexual individuals would soon be outcompeted in a population whenever asexual individuals appeared by mutation or migration. That is, were it not for some sexual bonus in Darwinian fitness, natural selection would act against alleles associated with sexual reproduction in favor of alleles that enable individuals to reproduce asexually. In fact, sex is maintained in the vast majority of eukaryotic species, even in those that can also reproduce asexually.

The "textbook" explanation for the advantage of sex is that the processes of meiosis and fertilization generate the genetic variation upon which natural selection can act as the agent of adaptation. (For this textbook's explanation, see Chapter 13.) But the notion that natural selection sustains sex in spite of its reproductive disadvantage because genetic variation enables future adaptation in an unpredictable world is an idea that is difficult to defend. Natural selection acts in the here and now, favoring the reproductive success of those individuals of a varying population that work best in the current, local environment. The most attractive hypotheses for how natural selection maintains sex are those that place value on genetic variation over the short term--on a generation-to-generation time scale.

One such hypothesis emphasizes the importance of genetic variation in resistance to disease. As we discussed earlier, many pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites recognize and infect their specific hosts by attaching to receptor molecules on the host's cells. There should be an advantage in producing offspring that vary in their resistance to different diseases. For example, one offspring variant may have cellular markers that make it resistant to virus A, while another may be resistant to virus B. This hypothesis predicts that the diversity of alleles would be particularly extensive at those gene loci that code for the molecules on cell surfaces to which pathogens attach. And that seems to be the case. In humans, for example, there are hundreds of alleles for each of two gene loci that code for the proteins that give cell surfaces their molecular fingerprints (you'll learn more about these cellular markers in Chapter 43). Of course, because most pathogens evolve very rapidly in their ability to key on specific host receptors, resistance of a particular host genotype to a given disease is not permanent. But sex provides a mechanism for "changing the locks" and varying them among offspring. Some biologists call this coevolution in a host-parasite relationship the "Red Queen effect," referring to the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, who admonished Alice that she would have to run as fast as she could to keep from going backward.





 Sexual selection may lead to pronounced secondary differences between the sexes

The males and females of an animal species obviously differ in their reproductive organs. But in many species, there are also marked differences, called secondary sexual characteristics, that are not directly associated with reproduction. This distinction in appearance is called sexual dimorphism. It is often manifested in a size difference, usually one in which males are larger than females. But sexual dimorphism can also be evident in such features as colorful plumage of male birds, manes on male lions, antlers on male deer, and other adornments. In fact, males are usually the showier sex in most cases of sexual dimorphism, at least among vertebrates.

Sexual dimorphism is a product of what Darwin called sexual selection. Today, biologists distinguish between intrasexual selection and intersexual selection. Meaning selection "within the same sex,"intrasexual selection is a direct competition among individuals of one sex (usually the males in vertebrates) for mates of the opposite sex. Males may use secondary sexual equipment such as antlers to battle competitors. This is especially common in species where a single male garners a harem of females. These males may gain their status by defeating smaller, weaker, or less fierce males in combat; more often, they are the victors in ritualized displays that discourage would-be competitors (see Chapter 51).

Intrasexual selection is a familiar sight in nature films, where rams butt heads, and in cartoons of lion kings claiming their thrones. However, intersexual selection is probably more common and, in a way, more intriguing. In intersexual selection, also called mate choice, individuals of one sex (usually females) are choosy in selecting their mates from individuals of the other sex. Apparently, males with the most impressive masculine features are the most attractive to females. A peacock strutting in front of hens with his tail feathers spread into a showy fan is an example of this "choose me" statement (FIGURE 23.16). What intrigued Darwin about such behavior is that some of the features that appear to help attract mates do not seem to be adaptive in any other way and may in fact pose some risk in natural environments. For example, showy plumage may make male birds more visible to predators. But if such secondary sexual characteristics help a male gain a mate, then they will be reinforced over the generations for the most Darwinian of reasons--because they enhance reproductive success. Every time a female chooses a mate based on a certain appearance or behavior, she perpetuates the alleles that caused her to make that choice and allows a male with a particular phenotype to perpetuate his alleles.

Fig 23-16. The Far Side of sexual selection.

When females choose mates, what is the benefit of focusing on secondary sexual characteristics such as showy tail fans? It is unlikely that this is some kind of aesthetic preference. Several researchers are now testing the hypothesis that these sexual advertisements reflect the general health of a male. For example, male birds with serious infections may have relatively dull, disheveled plumage. They don't usually win many females. And for the female that chooses a healthy mate, even if the inclination is just a prewired response to visual signals, the benefit is a greater probability of having healthy offspring.





 Natural selection cannot fashion perfect organisms

There are at least four reasons why natural selection cannot produce perfection.

Evolution is limited by historical constraints. Each species has a legacy of descent with modification from a long line of ancestral forms. Evolution does not scrap ancestral anatomy and build each new complex structure from scratch, but coopts existing structures and adapts them to new situations. For example, the excruciating back problems some humans endure result in part because the skeleton and musculature modified from the anatomy of four-legged ancestors are not fully compatible with upright posture.

Adaptations are often compromises. Each organism must do many different things. A seal spends part of its time on rocks; it could probably walk better if it had legs instead of flippers, but it would not swim nearly as well. We humans owe much of our versatility and athleticism to our prehensile hands and flexible limbs, which also make us prone to sprains, torn ligaments, and dislocations; structural reinforcement has been compromised for agility.

Not all evolution is adaptive. Chance probably affects the genetic structure of populations to a greater extent than was once believed. For instance, when a storm blows insects hundreds of miles over an ocean to an island, the wind does not necessarily transport the specimens that are best suited to the new environment. Thus, not all alleles fixed by genetic drift in the gene pool of the small founding population are better suited to the environment than alleles that are lost.

Selection can only edit existing variations. Natural selection favors only the fittest variations from the phenotypes that are available, which may not be the ideal traits. New alleles do not arise on demand.

With all these constraints, we cannot expect evolution to craft perfect organisms. Natural selection operates on a "better than" basis. We can see evidence for evolution in the subtle imperfections of the organisms it produces.

When Darwin saw that the geologically young Gal&aacute;pagos Islands had already become populated with many plants and animals known nowhere else in the world, he realized that he was visiting a place of genesis. The islands are named for the giant tortoises, such as the Geochelone elephantopus shown above, that are among the unique inhabitants. (Gal&aacute;pago is the Spanish word for tortoise.) After visiting the Gal&aacute;pagos, Darwin wrote in his diary: "Both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact--that mystery of mysteries--the first appearance of new beings on this Earth." The beginning of new forms of life--the origin of species--is at the focal point of evolutionary theory, for it is in new species that biological diversity arises. It is not enough to explain how adaptations evolve in populations, a topic covered in Chapter 23. Evolutionary theory must also explain macroevolution, the origin of new taxonomic groups (new species, new genera, new families, even new kingdoms). Speciation (the origin of new species) is the key process because any genus, family, or higher taxon originates with a new species that is novel enough to be the inaugural member of the higher taxon.

The fossil record chronicles two patterns of speciation: anagenesis and cladogenesis (FIGURE 24.1). Anagenesis (from the Greek ana, up, and genesis, origin), also known as phyletic evolution, is the accumulation of changes associated with the transformation of one species into another. Cladogenesis (from the Greek clados, branch), also called branching evolution, is the budding of one or more new species from a parent species that continues to exist. Only cladogenesis can promote biological diversity by increasing the number of species.

Fig 24-1. Two patterns of speciation. (a) Anagenesis (phyletic evolution) is the accumulation of heritable changes in a population, transforming that population into a new species. (b) Cladogenesis is branching evolution, in which a new species arises from a population that buds from a parent species. Cladogenesis is the basis for biological diversity.

Our objectives in this chapter are to evaluate definitions of species and mechanisms of speciation and to examine the possible origins of some novel features that define higher taxonomic groups. Our first step is to appraise the assumption that species actually exist in nature as discrete biological units distinct from all others.

 Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species



Species is a Latin word meaning "kind" or "appearance." Indeed, we learn to distinguish between the kinds of plants or animals--between dogs and cats, for instance--from differences in their appearance. In addition to comparing morphology (body form), modern taxonomists also consider differences in body functions, biochemistry, behavior, and genetic makeup. However, dividing organisms into different species based on comparative data is only part of an extensive effort to better understand the nature of species and the factors that maintain their distinctiveness in nature.





MODES OF SPECIATION

 

 Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species



 

 Sympatric speciation: A new species can originate in the geographic midst of the parent species



 

 The punctuated equilibrium model has stimulated research on thetempo of speciation



There are two general modes of speciation based on how gene flow among populations is initially interrupted (FIGURE 24.6). In a speciation mode termed allopatric speciation (from the Greek allos, other, and from the Latin patria, homeland), speciation takes place in populations with geographically separate ranges. Gene flow is initially interrupted or reduced between two populations because they are separated in space. In the second speciation mode, called sympatric speciation (from the Greek sym, together), speciation takes place in geographically overlapping populations. Here biological factors, such as chromosomal changes and nonrandom mating, reduce gene flow.

FROM SPECIATION TO MACROEVOLUTION

 

 Most evolutionary novelties are modified versions of older structures



 

 "Evo-devo": Genes that control development play a major role in evolution



 

 An evolutionary trend does not mean that evolution is goal oriented



Speciation is at the boundary between microevolution and macroevolution. Microevolution is a change over the generations in a population's allele frequencies, mainly by genetic drift and natural selection. Speciation occurs when a population's genetic divergence from its ancestral population results in reproductive isolation. The change in morphology during that divergence may be very conspicuous when we compare two closely related species, but usually the differences are more subtle, such as the color difference between the two cichlid species in FIGURE 24.16. Yet the cumulative change during millions of speciation episodes over vast tracts of time must account for macroevolution, the level of change that is evident over the time scale of the fossil record. How, for example, did feathers and other flight equipment evolve during the descent of birds from reptiles? Put more generally, how do the evolutionary novelties that define taxonomic groups above the species level, such as classes and phyla, evolve? In this last section, we look at some of the mechanisms behind macroevolution.





 The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation

A classical species definition known as the biological species concept was first enunciated by evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr in 1942. Mayr's definition addresses the question, What factors divide biological diversity into separate forms that we identify as species?

The biological species concept defines a species as a population or group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed with one another in nature to produce viable, fertile offspring, but who cannot produce viable, fertile offspring with members of other species (FIGURE 24.2). In other words, a biological species is the largest set of populations in which genetic exchange is possible and that is genetically isolated from other such populations. Members of a biological species are united by being reproductively compatible, at least potentially. A businesswoman in Manhattan has little probability of producing offspring with a dairyman in Mongolia, but if the two should get together, they could have viable babies that develop into fertile adults. All humans belong to the same biological species. In contrast, humans and chimpanzees remain distinct biological species even where they share territory, because the two species do not interbreed. Thus, the biological species concept hinges on reproductive isolation, with each species isolated by factors (barriers) that prevent interbreeding, thereby blocking genetic mixing with other species.

 Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers isolate the gene pools of biological species

Any factor that impedes two species from producing viable, fertile hybrids contributes to reproductive isolation. No single barrier may be completely impenetrable to genetic exchange, but many species are genetically sequestered by more than one type of barrier. Here, we are considering only biological barriers to reproduction, which are intrinsic to the organisms. Of course, if two species are geographically segregated, they cannot possibly interbreed, but a geographic barrier is not what biologists mean by reproductive isolation because it is not intrinsic to the organisms themselves. Reproductive isolation prevents populations belonging to different species from interbreeding, even if their ranges overlap.

Clearly, a fly will not mate with a frog or a fern, but what prevents biological species that are very similar--that is, closely related--from interbreeding? The various reproductive barriers that isolate the gene pools of species can be categorized as prezygotic or postzygotic, depending on whether they function before or after the formation of zygotes, or fertilized eggs.

Prezygotic Barriers

Prezygotic barriers impede mating between species or hinder the fertilization of ova if members of different species attempt to mate.

Habitat Isolation.Two species that live in different habitats within the same area may encounter each other rarely, if at all, even though they are not technically geographically isolated. For example, two species of garter snakes in the genus Thamnophis occur in the same areas, but one lives mainly in water and the other is primarily terrestrial. Habitat isolation also affects parasites, which are generally confined to certain plant or animal host species. Two species of parasites living on different hosts will not have a chance to mate.

Behavioral Isolation.Special signals that attract mates, as well as elaborate behavior unique to a species, are probably the most important reproductive barriers among closely related animals. Male fireflies of various species signal to females of their kind by blinking their lights in particular rhythms. The females respond only to signals characteristic of their own species, flashing back and attracting the males. The eastern and western meadowlarks shown in FIGURE 24.2a are almost identical in shape, coloration, and habitat, and their ranges overlap in the central United States. Yet they remain two separate biological species, partly because of the differences in their songs, which enable them to recognize individuals of their own kind. Behavioral isolation often depends on the elaborate courtship rituals of a particular species (FIGURE 24.3).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 24-3. Courtship ritual as a behavioral barrier between species. These blue-footed boobies, inhabitants of the Gal&aacute;pagos, will mate only after a specific ritual of courtship displays. Part of the "script" calls for the male to high-step, a behavior that advertises the bright blue feet characteristic of the species.

Temporal Isolation.Two species that breed during different times of the day, different seasons, or different years cannot mix their gametes. The geographic ranges of the western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) and the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) overlap, but these two very similar species do not interbreed because S. gracilis mates in late summer and S. putorius mates in late winter. Three species of the orchid genus Dendrobium living in the same rain forest do not hybridize because they flower on different days. Pollination of each species is limited to a single day because the flowers open in the morning and wither that evening.

Mechanical Isolation.Closely related species may attempt to mate but fail to consummate the act because they are anatomically incompatible. For example, mechanical barriers contribute to reproductive isolation of flowering plants that are pollinated by insects or other animals. Floral anatomy is often adapted to certain pollinators that transfer pollen only among plants of the same species. In another example of mechanical isolation, if insects of closely related species attempt to mate, the male and female copulatory organs may not fit together and no sperm would be transferred.

Gametic Isolation.Even if the gametes of different species meet, they rarely fuse to form a zygote. For animals whose eggs are fertilized within the female reproductive tract (internal fertilization), the sperm of one species may not be able to survive in the environment of the female reproductive tract of another species. Many aquatic animals release their gametes into the surrounding water, where the eggs are fertilized (external fertilization). Even when two closely related species release their gametes at the same time in the same place, cross-specific fertilization is uncommon. Gamete recognition may be based on the presence of specific molecules on the coats around the egg, which adhere only to complementary molecules on sperm cells of the same species. A similar mechanism of molecular recognition enables a flower to discriminate between pollen of the same species and pollen of different species.

Postzygotic Barriers

If a sperm cell from one species does fertilize an ovum of another species, then postzygotic barriers usually prevent the hybrid zygote from developing into a viable, fertile adult.

Reduced Hybrid Viability.When prezygotic barriers are crossed and hybrid zygotes are formed, genetic incompatibility between the two species may abort development of the hybrid at some embryonic stage. Of the numerous species of frogs belonging to the genus Rana, some live in the same regions and habitats, where they may occasionally hybridize. But the hybrids generally do not complete development, and those that do are frail.

Reduced Hybrid Fertility.Even if two species mate and produce hybrid offspring that are vigorous, reproductive isolation is intact if the hybrids are completely or largely sterile. Since the infertile hybrid cannot backbreed with either parental species, genes cannot flow freely between the species. One cause of this barrier is a failure of meiosis to produce normal gametes in the hybrid if chromosomes of the two parent species differ in number or structure. A familiar case of a sterile hybrid is the mule, a robust cross between a horse and a donkey; horses and donkeys remain distinct species because, except very rarely, mules cannot backbreed with either species (FIGURE 24.4).

Fig 24-4. Hybrid sterility, a postzygotic barrier. Horses and donkeys remain separate species because their hybrid offspring, mules, are sterile.

Hybrid Breakdown.In some cases when species cross-mate, the first-generation hybrids are viable and fertile, but when these hybrids mate with one another or with either parent species, offspring of the next generation are feeble or sterile. For example, different cotton species can produce fertile hybrids, but breakdown occurs in the next generation when offspring of the hybrids die as seeds or grow into weak and defective plants.

FIGURE 24.5 summarizes the reproductive barriers between closely related species.

 The biological species concept hassome major limitations

In its emphasis on reproductive barriers as the boundaries between species, the biological species concept has had an important impact on evolutionary theory and how we think of species as discrete forms of life. However, as a criterion for actually distinguishing species in nature, the biological species concept does not work in all situations and is in fact impractical for demarcating species in most cases. For example, there is no way to check interbreeding in the extinct forms represented by fossils. Biologists classify fossils into species based on differences in morphology. Even most living species are distinguished by comparative morphology because we lack the information about interbreeding necessary to apply the biological species concept as the criterion. The biological species concept also has no utility at all for life-forms that are entirely asexual, such as bacteria. (Many bacteria do transfer genes by conjugation and other processes--see Chapter 18--but there is nothing akin to the sexual union of gametes from two parents.) Biologists assign asexual organisms to species based mainly on structural and biochemical characteristics.





 Evolutionary biologists have proposed several alternative concepts of species

The biological species concept emphasizes a separateness of different species due to reproductive barriers. In contrast, several alternative species concepts emphasize the processes that unite the members of a species. The distinction is analogous to defining a country not by the borders that separate it from other countries but by the set of cultural features that give the country an identity.

The ecological species concept defines a species in terms of its ecological niche, the set of environmental resources a species uses. Put another way, a species' niche depends on its unique adaptations to a particular role in a biological community. (We will examine the concept of ecological niche in more detail in Chapter 53.) For example, a species that is a parasite may be defined in part by its adaptations to a specific host organism. Note that this species concept accommodates asexual species, which the biological species concept does not.

According to a pluralistic species concept, the factors that are most important for the cohesion of individuals as a species vary. In some cases, reproductive isolation may be a key unifying factor for a species. In other cases, adaptation to a specific ecological niche may be the main factor in species cohesion. In still other cases, the integrity of the species may depend on some combination of reproductive isolation and a unique niche.

The biological, ecological, and pluralistic species concepts are all "explanatory" concepts--attempts to explain the very existence of species as discrete units in the diversity of life. None, however, is especially useful in actually identifying various species in nature. For that, taxonomists still depend mainly on morphological characteristics. Thus, although it doesn't really explain why species exist, the morphological species concept, which characterizes each species in terms of a unique set of structural features, remains the way we distinguish most species.

Many evolutionary biologists are also evaluating a genealogical species concept, which defines a species as a set of organisms with a unique genetic history--that is, as one tip on the branching tree of life. The sequencing of nucleic acids and proteins provides data that researchers are now using to define each species in terms of unique genetic markers. Like the morphological species concept, the genealogical one is more concerned with identifying the various species than with a theoretical explanation for their existence as separate forms of life.

Each species concept has utility, depending on the situation and the types of questions we are asking. The biological species concept, in its emphasis on reproductive barriers to gene flow, is particularly useful in thinking about how species originate. Next, we examine the processes that can lead to such speciation.





 Allopatric speciation: Geographic barriers can lead to the origin of species

Conditions for Allopatric Speciation

Several geologic processes can fragment a population into two or more isolated populations. A mountain range may emerge and gradually split a population of organisms that can inhabit only lowlands. A land bridge, such as the Isthmus of Panama, may form and separate the marine life on either side. A large lake may subside until there are several smaller lakes with their populations now isolated. Even without such geologic remodeling, geographic isolation and allopatric speciation can occur if individuals colonize a new, geographically remote area and become isolated from the parent population. An example is the speciation that occurred on the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands following colonization by mainland organisms.

How formidable must a geographic barrier be to keep allopatric populations apart? The answer depends on the ability of the organisms to move about. Birds, mountain lions, and coyotes can cross mountain ranges, rivers, and canyons. Nor do such barriers hinder the windblown pollen of pine trees, and the seeds of many plants may be carried back and forth on animals. In contrast, small rodents may find a deep canyon or a wide river a formidable barrier (FIGURE 24.7).

Fig 24-7. Allopatric speciation of squirrels in the Grand Canyon. Two species of antelope squirrels inhabit opposite rims of the Grand Canyon. On the south rim is Harris's antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus harrisi). Just a few miles away on the north rim is the closely related white-tailed antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilis leucurus). Birds and other organisms that can disperse easily across the canyon have not diverged into different species on opposite rims.

The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is both small and isolated. A small, isolated population is more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially by genetic drift and natural selection. For example, in less than 2 million years, small populations of stray animals and plants from the South American mainland that managed to colonize the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands gave rise to all the new species that now inhabit the islands. But for each small, isolated population that becomes a new species, many more simply perish in their new environment. Life on the frontier is harsh, and most pioneer populations probably become extinct.

A key question about allopatric populations is whether they have become different enough that they can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring if they come back into contact (FIGURE 24.8). In some cases, researchers evaluate whether speciation has occurred by artificially bringing together members of separated populations in a laboratory setting. In other cases, biologists can investigate allopatric speciation where separated populations have come back into contact naturally.

Ring Species: Allopatric Speciation in Progress?

Some species have geographic distributions that provide evolutionary biologists with examples of what seem to be populations at various stages in their gradual divergence from common ancestors. Consider a so-called ring species, which is distributed around some geographic barrier, with the populations that have diverged the most in their evolution eventually meeting where the ring closes. FIGURE 24.9 illustrates populations of a North American salamander, Ensatina eschscholtzii. The species probably expanded southward into California from Oregon. The California population eventually split into a coastal population and an inland one, giving rise to two separate chains of interbreeding populations. One chain extends down the coastal mountains and one extends down the inland mountains (Sierra Nevada range). The dual chains of salamander populations gradually formed a ring around California's central valley (the San Joaquin Valley). Salamanders of the different populations contrast in coloration, and researchers have demonstrated that the coastal and inland populations exhibit more and more genetic differences the farther south the comparison is made.

Fig 24-9. Ensatina eschscholtzii, a ring species. The gap in the ring in southern California indicates that researchers have not yet collected salamanders in that desert location, but genetic analysis indicates a close relationship between the large-blotched salamander and inland populations at the southern end of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

In the northern and middle portions of the ring, the salamander populations interbreed as a single species (as defined by the biological species concept). About halfway down the ring, the coastal and inland gene pools occasionally "leak" across the central valley as members of the two populations interbreed. But near the ring's southern end in San Diego County, no hybridization occurs in some of the locales where the ranges of coastal and inland populations overlap. Based on the criterion of reproductive isolation, it is legitimate to designate the two southern populations as separate species.

Adaptive Radiation on Island Chains

Islands are living laboratories for the study of speciation. Flurries of allopatric speciation have occurred on island chains where organisms that have strayed or become passively dispersed from their parent populations have founded new populations that evolved in isolation (FIGURE 24.10). The many indigenous species of the Gal&aacute;pagos descended from stragglers that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland. For example, consider the Gal&aacute;pagos finches. A single dispersal event may have seeded one island with a small population of the ancestral finch, which gave rise to a new species. Later, a few individuals of this island species may have reached neighboring islands, where geographic isolation permitted additional speciation episodes. After diverging on one of these other islands, a new species could recolonize the island from which its founding population emigrated and coexist there with its parent species or form still another species. Multiple colonizations by species from neighboring islands would eventually lead to the coexistence of several species on each island. The islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough together for occasional dispersion events to occur. Such evolution of many diversely adapted species from a common ancestor is called adaptive radiation (FIGURE 24.11).

Fig 24-11. A model for adaptive radiation on island chains.

The Hawaiian Archipelago is one of the world's great showcases of evolution (see FIGURE 22.16). The volcanic islands are about 3,500 km from the nearest continent. They become progressively younger to the southeast, terminating with the youngest and largest island, Hawaii, which is less than a million years old and still has active volcanoes. Each island was born naked and was gradually populated by species derived from strays that rode the ocean currents and winds either from distant islands and continents or from older islands of the archipelago itself. The physical diversity of each island, including a range of altitudes and extensive differences in rainfall, provides many environmental opportunities for evolutionary divergence by natural selection. Multiple invasions and allopatric speciations have ignited an explosion of adaptive radiation; most of the thousands of species of plants and animals that now inhabit the islands are found nowhere else in the world. In contrast, there are no indigenous species on the Florida Keys. Apparently, those islands are so close to the mainland that founding populations are not sufficiently sequestered for their gene pools to become isolated from the steady stream of immigrants from the parent populations on the mainland.

How Do Reproductive Barriers Evolve?

This is a good time to address two potential misunderstandings about allopatric speciation. First, it is important to understand that geographic isolation, while obviously preventing interbreeding between allopatric populations, does not qualify as reproductive isolation in the biological sense. The reproductive barriers relevant to the biological species concept are intrinsic to the organisms themselves and prevent interbreeding even in the absence of geographic isolation (see FIGURE 24.5 to review reproductive barriers). Second, it is important to realize that speciation is not due to some drive to erect reproductive barriers around a population. In most cases, reproductive barriers are probably coincidental to changes in gene pools due to natural selection and genetic drift as allopatric populations evolve separately. Let's examine a couple of examples.

Example of Evolution of a Prezygotic Barrier. Diane Dodd, of Yale University, designed laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that reproductive barriers between allopatric populations can evolve as a by-product of the populations' adaptive divergence in different environments. She divided a sample of fruit flies (Drosophila pseudoobscura) into several laboratory populations that were then cultured for several generations on different nutrient sources. Some populations were nourished with a starch medium, while others were nourished with a maltose (malt sugar) medium (FIGURE 24.12). Acting over several generations, natural selection favored those individuals that were best suited to the available nutrient; populations reared on starch improved in their efficiency at starch digestion, while the "maltose" populations improved in their efficiency at malt sugar digestion.

Fig 24-12. Evolution of reproductive isolation in lab populations of Drosophila.

After the two types of fly populations diverged in their evolution for several generations, Dodd combined flies from various populations in mate-choice experiments. Female "maltose flies" were more likely to mate with male maltose flies than with male "starch flies," even if the maltose flies came from a different maltose fly population. The female starch flies also seemed to discriminate in favor of other starch flies as mates. This is an example of a prezygotic barrier--in this case, a behavioral obstacle to interbreeding. The reproductive barrier was not absolute--some mating between maltose flies and starch flies did occur--but reproductive isolation was apparently well under way after several generations of evolutionary divergence.

Why would a reproductive barrier between two populations be a consequence of their divergent adaptation to different environments? Specifically, how could adaptation to a certain diet affect mate choice? One hypothesis is based on pleiotropy, where one allele has multiple effects on phenotype--in this case affecting both nutrient digestion and mate choice (see Chapter 14). Mating in fruit flies follows an elaborate courtship ritual that includes a song produced by the buzzing of the wings, a dance with specific "steps," and detection of specific odors emitted from the potential mate's cuticle, the hard covering of insects. Perhaps the same allele(s) that enhances digestion of a certain carbohydrate also affects the chemical composition of the cuticle and determines which of these "bouquet" molecules function in mate recognition. How could you test this hypothesis?

Example of Evolution of a Postzygotic Barrier.Robert Vickery, of the University of Utah, tested the ability of plants from different populations of monkey flower (Mimulus glabratus) to interbreed. (The plant is named for its flower, which resembles a monkey's face.) The species has a very large range that extends throughout the Americas. Vickery imported Mimulus plants from different regions and cross-pollinated them in his greenhouse. He then planted the seeds of the hybrids to see if they developed into fertile plants. Most of the offspring were fertile when the cross was between plants from nearby populations--say, between Wisconsin and Michigan Mimulus. But the proportion of fertile offspring dropped off when Vickery crossed plants from more distant populations. In fact, the offspring of hybrids from crosses between plants from Wisconsin and Mexico were almost all sterile. Note that this is a postzygotic barrier (hybrid breakdown; see FIGURE 24.5).

Again, it is important to dispel the notion that such a reproductive barrier evolves because of some kind of drive toward speciation. In fact, natural selection probably maintains reproductive compatibility between neighboring Mimulus populations because hybridization between these populations occurs often enough in nature that alleles hampering reproductive success of the hybrids would be eliminated from the gene pool. But a Wisconsin monkey flower would never hybridize naturally with one from Mexico, and thus there is no selection pressure keeping the genomes of such distant populations compatible enough for successful interbreeding. It's not that selection favors a reproductive barrier between allopatric populations, but that there is no longer any advantage to the absence of such barriers.

Summary of Allopatric Speciation

In allopatric speciation, a new species forms while geographically isolated from its ancestor. As the isolated population's gene pool evolves by genetic drift and natural selection, reproductive isolation from the ancestral species may evolve as a by-product of the genetic change. Such reproductive barriers prevent interbreeding with the ancestor, even if the populations come back into contact. We have examined four examples of how biologists are dissecting the process of allopatric speciation: the evolutionary divergence of populations of a ring species (the salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii); the adaptive radiation of island species; the origin of a prezygotic barrier to interbreeding in lab populations of the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura; and the origin of a postzygotic barrier between distant populations of the monkey flower Mimulus glabratus. Let's turn next to mechanisms that can produce a new species without geographic isolation from its ancestor.





 Sympatric speciation: A new species can originate in the geographic midst of the parent species

In sympatric speciation, new species arise within the range of parent populations rather than in geographically separate populations (see FIGURE 24.6b). How can reproductive barriers between sympatric populations evolve? Let's examine examples in both the plant and animal kingdoms.

Polyploid Speciation in Plants

Some plant species have their origins in accidents during cell division that result in extra sets of chromosomes, a mutant condition called polyploidy. An autopolyploid (from the Greek autos, self) is an individual that has more than two chromosome sets, all derived from a single species. For example, a failure of meiosis during gamete production can double chromosome number from the diploid count (2n) to a tetraploid number (4n) (FIGURE 24.13). The tetraploid can then fertilize itself (self-pollinate) or mate with other tetraploids. However, the mutants cannot interbreed successfully with diploid plants of the original population; the offspring, which would be triploid (3n), would be sterile because unpaired chromosomes result in abnormal meiosis. In just one generation, a postzygotic barrier has caused reproductive isolation and has interrupted gene flow between a tiny population of tetraploids (maybe only a single plant initially) and the parent diploid population that surrounds it. Sympatric speciation by autopolyploidy was first discovered in the early 1900s by geneticist Hugo de Vries when his experiments produced a new species of evening primrose (FIGURE 24.14, p. 474).

Fig 24-14. Botanist Hugo de Vries and his new primrose species. Working in the early 1900s, de Vries studied variation in evening primroses. In his breeding experiments with Oenothera lamarckiana (lower left), a diploid species of primrose with 14 chromosomes, he produced a new variety with 28 chromosomes. It was a tetraploid, which could not interbreed with its parent species. De Vries named the new primrose species Oenothera gigas, for its large size (upper right).

Another type of polyploid species, much more common than autopolyploids, is called an allopolyploid, referring to the contribution of two different species to a polyploid hybrid. The origin of an allopolyploid begins when two different species interbreed and combine their chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids are usually sterile because the haploid set of chromosomes from one species cannot pair during meiosis with the haploid set from the other species. Though infertile, a hybrid may actually be more vigorous than its parents and propagate itself asexually (which many plants can do). Various mechanisms can then change a sterile hybrid into a fertile polyploid (FIGURE 24.15 on p. 474 illustrates one such mechanism). The polyploid hybrids are fertile with each other but cannot interbreed with either parental species.

Fig 24-15. One mechanism for allopolyploid speciation in plants. A hybrid between two species is normally sterile because its chromosomes are not homologous and cannot pair during meiosis. However, the hybrids may be able to reproduce asexually. This diagram traces one mechanism that can produce fertile hybrids as new polyploid species. The new species has a chromosome number equal to the sum of the chromosomes in the two parent species.

The origin of new polyploid plant species is common enough and rapid enough that scientists have documented several such speciations. For example, two new species of plants called goatsbeards originated in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1900s. The goatsbeard genus, Tragopogon, is native to Europe, but three species were introduced by humans to the Americas in the early 1900s. These species, T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius, are now common weeds in urban wastelands such as abandoned parking lots. In the 1950s, botanists identified two new species of Tragopogon in regions of Idaho and eastern Washington where all three European species are also found. One new species, T. miscellus, is a tetraploid hybrid of T. dubius and T. pratensis; the other new species, T. mirus, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors are T. dubius and T. porrifolius. While the T. mirus population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, additional episodes of hybridization between the ancestral species also add to the T. mirus population. This is an ongoing speciation process we can observe today.

Many of the plants we grow for food are polyploids. Oats, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, and wheat are among the polyploid species important to agriculture. The wheat used for bread, Triticum aestivum, is an allopolyploid that probably originated about 8,000 years ago as a spontaneous hybrid of a cultivated wheat and a wild grass. Plant geneticists now hybridize plants and use chemicals that induce meiotic and mitotic errors to help create new polyploids with special qualities. For example, artificial hybrids combine the high yield of wheat with the ability of rye to resist disease.

Sympatric Speciation in Animals

Although polyploid speciation is less common in animals than in plants, it does occur. However, there are other mechanisms that can lead to sympatric speciation in animals. For example, animals may become reproductively isolated within the geographic range of a parent population if genetic factors cause them to become dependent on resources not used by the parent population. Consider, for example, the wasps that pollinate figs. Each fig species is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which mates and lays its eggs in the figs. A genetic change that caused wasps to select a different fig species would segregate mating individuals of this new phenotype from the parent population. This would set the stage for further evolutionary divergence.

One of Earth's hot spots of animal speciation is Lake Victoria, in East Africa. The lake, which is less than a million years old, is home to almost 200 species of closely related fishes belonging to the cichlid family. The subdivision of populations into groups specialized for exploiting different food sources and other resources in the lake is one process that probably contributed to the adaptive radiation of these fishes. But in at least some cases, nonrandom mating, in which females select males having a certain appearance, was probably a key factor in the sympatric speciation of cichlids. Consider two closely related sympatric species of cichlids that differ mainly in coloration: Pundamilia pundamilia has a blue back, and Pundamilia nyererei has a red back. It is a reasonable hypothesis that a preference for mates of like coloration functions as a behavioral barrier to interbreeding between the two species. In 1998, biologists from Holland's University of Leiden published experiments testing this hypothesis (FIGURE 24.16). In an aquarium with natural light, females of each species mated only with males of their own species. But in an aquarium illuminated with a monochromatic orange lamp, which makes the two cichlid species appear identical in color, females of each species mated indiscriminately with males of both species. The hybrids from the errant P. pundamilia &#160;X&#160; P. nyererei matings were viable and fertile. We can infer that mate choice based on coloration is the main reproductive barrier that normally keeps the gene pools of these two species separate. And we can also infer, since the genetic divergence is small enough that the species can still interbreed when the prezygotic barrier is breached, that speciation occurred relatively recently. Perhaps the ancestral population was polymorphic for coloration and divergence began with mate choice by two subsets of females preferring one or the other color of male. Sexual selection would then reinforce the color difference as females mated preferentially with males having genes for the least mistakable coloration (see Chapter 23 to review sexual selection).

Females of each species mate only with males of their own species. (b) With monochromatic lighting in laboratory experiments, females apparently cannot distinguish males of the two species and mate indiscriminately, producing fertile hybrids.

Summary of Sympatric Speciation

Sympatric speciation requires the emergence of some type of reproductive barrier that isolates the gene pool of a subset of a population without geographic separation from the parent population. In plants, the mechanism that is best understood is hybridization between closely related species coupled with errors during cell division that lead to polyploid individuals that are fertile. In animals, sympatric speciation can result from some subset of a population becoming reproductively isolated because of a switch to a habitat, food source, or other resource not used by the parent population (speciation in fig-eating flies is an example); or it can result from the emergence of a rigid mating preference by females for specific male forms in a polymorphic population (as in our example of cichlid speciation).





 The punctuated equilibrium model has stimulated research on thetempo of speciation

Traditional evolutionary trees that diagram the descent of species from ancestral forms sprout branches that diverge gradually, with species evolving continuously over long spans of time (FIGURE 24.17a, p. 476). Such trees are based on the idea that big changes occur by the accumulation of many small ones. This concept extends the processes of microevolution to the divergence of species. However, paleontologists rarely find gradual transitions of fossil forms. Instead, they often observe species appearing as new forms rather suddenly (in geologic terms) in a layer of rocks, persisting essentially unchanged for their tenure on Earth, and then disappearing from the fossil record as suddenly as they appeared. Darwin was bewildered by the dearth of connecting fossils and wrote: "Although each species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is probable that the periods during which each underwent modification, though many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition."

Fig 24-17. Two models for the tempo of speciation.

We can account for the "sudden" appearances of new forms in the fossil record partly by applying the allopatric model of speciation. In allopatric speciation, a new species arises as a splinter population in a separate place from where the ancestral species lives. If the new species later extends its range into that of the ancestral species, what we see in the fossil record is the geologically sudden appearance of a new species in a locale where there are also fossils of the ancestral species, though maybe in different strata. By then, the ancestor may have been extinct (or competition from the new species could contribute to extinction). Alternatively, the new species could coexist in the same range as the ancestor. Either way, the new species does not appear in the fossil record at the site of its ancestor until it has diverged in form during its period of geographic separation.

Advocates of a model called punctuated equilibrium incorporate ideas about the tempo of speciation in their explanations of what we see in the fossil record. According to this model, species diverge in spurts of relatively rapid change, instead of slowly and gradually (FIGURE 24.17b). In other words, species undergo most of their morphological modification as they first bud from parent species and then change little, even as they give rise to additional species. The term punctuated equilibrium is derived from the idea of long periods of stasis (equilibrium) punctuated by episodes of speciation.

How can speciation in a few thousand generations, which may require several thousand years, be called an abrupt episode? The fossil record indicates that successful species last for a few million years, on average. Suppose that a particular species survives for 5 million years, but most of its morphological changes occurred during the first 50,000 years of its existence. In this case, the evolution of the species-defining characteristics was compressed into just 1%  of the lifetime of the species. On the time scale that can generally be determined in fossil strata, the species will appear suddenly in rocks of a certain age and then linger with little or no change before becoming extinct. During its formative millennia, the species may have accumulated its modifications gradually, but relative to the overall history of the species, its inception was abrupt.

Once it is acknowledged that "sudden" may be many thousands of years on the vast scale of geologic time, the debate over the rate of speciation is muted somewhat. The degree to which a species changes after its origin is another issue. If the species is adapted to an environment that stays the same, then natural selection would counter changes in the gene pool. In this view, stabilizing selection tends to hold a population in a long period of stasis (see Chapter 23).

Some gradualists retort that stasis is an illusion. Many species may continue to change after they come into existence, but in ways that cannot be detected from fossils. By necessity, paleontologists base their theories of descent almost entirely on external anatomy and skeletons. Changes in internal anatomy and physiology may go unnoticed, as would modifications in behavior.





 Most evolutionary novelties are modified versions of older structures

We can extend the Darwinian concept of "descent with modification" to account for the major morphological transformations of macroevolution. In some cases, very complex structures evolved in increments from much simpler versions that had the same basic function. For example, the human eye is a refined optical organ constructed from multiple parts that work together in forming an image and sending that visual information to the brain. Many people find it hard to believe that such complex organs could be products of gradual evolution rather than finished designs created especially for humans. If the eye needs all its parts to work, the argument goes, how could a partial eye be of any use as an evolutionary stage? The fallacy is in the starting assumption that eyes have to be this complicated to be useful to an animal. The most basic versions of eyes are just clusters of photoreceptor cells, pigmented cells sensitive to light. Only slightly more refined are the eyes of the flatworms called planarians, which have their photoreceptor cells lining cup-shaped indentations on the head. These eyecups have no lenses or other equipment for focusing images, but they do enable the animal to distinguish light from dark; planarians move away from light, a behavioral adaptation that probably reduces the risk of being eaten.

Complex eyes of various types evolved independently from simpler ones many times in the animal kingdom. For example, some mollusks (members of the invertebrate phylum Mollusca), including squids and octopuses, have eyes every bit as complex as those of humans and other vertebrates. Among living mollusks, we can find eyes ranging in complexity from clusters of photoreceptors to camera-like eyes with lenses (FIGURE 24.18). Considering the long success of many so-called "primitive" animals with simple eyecups, such as flatworms and certain mollusks, it is clear that eyecups work fine for what these animals have to do to survive and reproduce. In those animals that do have complex eyes, the organs evolved from simpler ones not in one quantum evolutionary jump, but by incremental adaptation of organs that worked and benefited their owners at each stage of this macroevolution.

(b) The slit shell mollusk Pleurotomaria has an eyecup.(c) The Nautilus eye functions like a pinhole camera (an early type of camera lacking a lens). A thick fluid in a cavity helps focus light onto the retina, a layer of photoreceptors. (d) The eye of Murex, a marine snail, has a primitive lens consisting of a mass of crystal-like cells. The cornea is a transparent region of epithelium (outer skin) that protects the eye and helps focus light. (e) The squid Loligo has a complex "camera-Light" type eye with a cornea, lens, and retina.

The evolution of the eye refined organs that retained the basic function of vision. But evolutionary novelty can also arise by the gradual refinement of existing structures for new functions. Such structures that evolve in one context but become co-opted for another function are called exaptations. This concept does not imply that a structure somehow evolves in anticipation of future use. Natural selection cannot predict the future and can only improve a structure in the context of its current utility. The lightweight, honeycombed bones of birds (see FIGURE 1.6b) are homologous to the bones of the earthbound ancestors of birds. However, honeycombed bones could not have evolved in the ancestors as an adaptation for upcoming flights. If light bones predated flight, as is clearly indicated by the fossil record, then they must have had some function on the ground. The probable ancestors of birds were relatively small, agile, bipedal dinosaurs that also would have benefited from a light frame. It is possible that winglike forelimbs and feathers, which increased the surface area of these forelimbs, were also co-opted for flight after functioning in some other capacity, such as social displays--in courtship, for example. The first flights may have been only extended hops in pursuit of prey or escape from a predator. Once flight itself became an advantage, natural selection would have remodeled feathers and wings to better fit their additional function.

Exaptation offers one explanation for how novel features can arise gradually through a series of intermediate stages, each of which has some function in the organism's current context. Harvard zoologist Karel Liem puts it this way: "Evolution is like modifying a machine while it's running."





 "Evo-devo": Genes that control development play a major role in evolution

The interface between evolutionary biology and the study of how organisms develop is called "evo-devo." This interdisciplinary research is beginning to illuminate how slight genetic divergences can become magnified into major morphological differences between species. Genes that program development control the rate, timing, and spatial pattern of changes in an organism's form as it is transfigured from a zygote into an adult.

The shape of an organism depends in part on the relative growth rates of its different parts during development. This proportioning that helps give a body its specific form is called allometric growth (from the Greek allos, other, and metron, measure). FIGURE 24.19a tracks how allometric growth alters human body proportions during development. Change these relative rates of growth even slightly, and you change the adult form substantially. For example, different allometric patterns contribute to the contrasting shapes of human and chimpanzee skulls (FIGURE 24.19b).

Fig 24-19. Allometric growth. Different growth rates for different parts of the body determine body proportions.

Evolution of morphology that arises by a modification in allometric growth is an example of heterochrony, which is evolutionary change in the rate or timing of developmental events. We can see another example of heterochrony in the evolution of salamander feet. Most salamanders are ground-dwelling, but some species live in trees. The feet of these tree-dwelling salamanders are adapted for climbing vertically rather than walking horizontally on the ground, with shorter digits and more webbing than the feet of ground-dwelling salamanders (FIGURE 24.20). The basis for this adaptation was probably selection for mutant alleles of genes controlling the timing of foot development. According to this hypothesis, the foot of the ancestral salamander grew until the products of certain regulatory genes switched off growth, resulting in a foot of a certain size. A mutation in one or more of these regulatory genes could have switched off foot growth sooner, resulting in the stunted feet of tree-dwelling salamanders. In this way, a relatively small amount of genetic change can be amplified into the substantial morphological change that marks macroevolution.

Fig 24-20. Heterochrony and the evolution of salamander feet among closely related species.

Heterochrony can also change the timing of reproductive development relative to development of somatic (nonreproductive) organs. If the rate of reproductive development accelerates compared to somatic development, the sexually mature stage of a species may retain body features that were juvenile structures in an ancestral species. This is called paedomorphosis (from the Greek paedos, child, and morphosis, formation). For example, most salamander species have a larval stage that undergoes metamorphosis to become an adult. But some species grow to adult size and become sexually mature while retaining gills and certain other larval features (FIGURE 24.21). Such an evolutionary alteration of developmental timing can produce animals that appear very different from their ancestors, even though the overall genetic change may be small.

Fig 24-21. Paedomorphosis. Some species retain as adults features that were juvenile in ancestors. This salamander is an axolotl, which grows to full size, becomes sexually mature, and reproduces while retaining certain larval (tadpole) characteristics, including gills.

In short, heterochrony affects the evolution of morphology by altering the rates of development of various body parts or by changing the timing of onset or completion of a particular part's development.

Macroevolution can also result from changes in genes that control the placement and spatial organization of body parts. For example, genes called homeotic genes determine such basic features as where a pair of wings and a pair of legs will develop on a bird or how a plant's flower parts are arranged (see Chapter 21).

The products of one class of homeotic genes called Hox genes provide positional information in an animal embryo. This information about position prompts cells to develop into structures appropriate for a particular location. Changes in Hox genes can have a profound impact on morphology. Consider, for example, the evolution of tetrapods (the terrestrial vertebrates: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) from fishes, which are aquatic vertebrates. One of the major transitions in this vertebrate history was the evolution of the walking legs of tetrapods from the fins of fishes. Unlike the fish fin, the tetrapod limb has digits (fingers and toes in humans) that extend skeletal support to the tip of the limb. During the development of a tetrapod, a Hox gene is expressed at the outer edge of the limb bud, the embryonic structure that develops into a leg. The product of this Hox gene apparently provides positional information about how far outward bones should grow in the limb (FIGURE 24.22). A related Hox gene is expressed during the development of a fish fin, but in a smaller region back from the tip of the fin bud. A mutation in this Hox gene that expanded its region of expression to the tip of the bud probably contributed to the evolution of skeletal extensions that made it possible for limbs to support vertebrates on land. The evolution of vertebrates from invertebrate animals was an even bigger episode in macroevolution, and it, too, was probably associated with changes in Hox genes (see FIGURE 24.23, p. 480).

In producing evolutionary novelties, changes in developmental dynamics, both temporal (heterochrony) and spatial, have undoubtedly played important roles in macroevolution.





 An evolutionary trend does not mean that evolution is goal oriented

The fossil record seems to reveal trends in the evolution of many species and lineages. For instance, some lineages exhibit a trend toward larger or smaller body size. A case in point is the evolution of the modern horse, which is a descendant of a much smaller ancestor named Hyracotherium. About the size of a large dog, Hyracotherium browsed in woodlands some 40 million years ago. In comparison to this ancestor, modern horses (genus Equus) are larger, the number of toes has been reduced from four on each foot to one, and the teeth have become modified for grazing on grasses rather than browsing on shrubs and trees. Do these macroevolutionary changes represent trends, and if so, how do we account for such trends?

Extracting a single evolutionary progression from a fossil record that is likely to be incomplete is misleading; it is like describing a bush as growing toward a single point by tracing the system of branches that leads from the base of the bush to one particular twig. For instance, by selecting certain species from the available fossils, it is possible to arrange a succession of animals intermediate between Hyracotherium and modern horses that shows trends toward increased size, reduced number of toes, and modification of teeth for grazing (yellow line in FIGURE 24.24). We might interpret this series of fossils as an unbranched lineage leading directly from Hyracotherium to modern horses through a continuum of intermediate stages. If we include all fossil horses known today, however, the illusion of coherent, progressive evolution leading directly to modern horses vanishes. The genus Equus is the only surviving twig of an evolutionary tree that is so branched that it is more like a bush. Equus descended through a series of speciation episodes that included several adaptive radiations, not all of which led to large, one-toed, grazing horses. For instance, notice in FIGURE 24.24 that only those lineages derived from Parahippus include grazers; other lineages derived from Miohippus produced browsers.

Fig 24-24. The branched evolution of horses. If we use a yellow highlighter to trace the sequence of fossil horses that are intermediate in form between the modern horse and its Eocene ancestor Hyracotherium, we create the illusion of a progressive trend toward larger size, reduced number of toes, and teeth modified for grazing. In fact, the modern horse is the only surviving twig of an evolutionary bush with many divergent trends.

Branching evolution can produce a macroevolutionary trend even if some new species counter the trend. In a view of macroevolution enunciated by Steven Stanley, of Johns Hopkins University, species are analogous to individuals: Speciation is their birth, extinction is their death, and new species are their offspring. According to this model, an evolutionary trend is produced by species selection, which is analogous to the production of a trend within a population by natural selection. The species that endure the longest and generate the greatest number of new species determine the direction of major evolutionary trends. This concept suggests that differential speciation plays a role in macroevolution similar to the role of differential reproduction in microevolution.

To the extent that speciation rates and species longevity reflect success, the analogy to natural selection is even stronger. But qualities unrelated to the overall success of organisms in specific environments may be equally important in species selection. For example, the ability of a species to disperse to new locations may contribute to its giving rise to a large number of "daughter species." The species selection model has many critics who argue that evolutionary trends more commonly result from the gradual modification of populations in response to environmental change. The value of such debates is that they stimulate research, and many paleontologists and other evolutionary biologists are now focusing on the question of what produces evolutionary trends.

Whatever its cause, the appearance of an evolutionary trend does not0 imply that there is some intrinsic drive toward a preordained state of being. Evolution is a response to interactions between organisms and their current environments. If conditions change, an evolutionary trend may cease or even reverse itself.

In the next chapter, we will continue our study of macroevolution with a more detailed look at the fossil record and some of the effects of significant environmental change on species and speciation.

Evolutionary biology is about both process and history. We have already studied natural selection and other processes that change populations (Chapter 23), and we have examined processes that can lead to the origin of new species (Chapter 24). But evolutionary biology also seeks to reconstruct the history of life on Earth.

This chapter describes how biologists trace phylogeny (from the Greek, phylon, tribe, and genesis, origin), the evolutionary history of a species or group of related species. Reconstructing phylogeny is part of the scope of systematics, the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Systematists also name and classify species. Our study of phylogeny and systematics begins with the fossils left by past life, such as the ancient fish in the photo above. We then examine the techniques through which systematists test and refine their hypotheses about phylogeny and classification. In the process, we see how molecular biology is changing systematics, as it is changing every field of biology.

Fossils, the preserved remnants or impressions left by organisms that lived in the past, are the historical documents of biology. The fossil record is the ordered array in which fossils appear within layers, or strata, of sedimentary rocks that mark the passing of geologic time. Paleontologists collect and interpret fossils (FIGURE 25.1). We begin this section by studying how fossils form and how paleontologists determine their age. We then turn to the contributions and limitations of the fossil record in the study of phylogeny.

 Modern systematics is flourishing with lively debate



So far in this chapter, we have explored phylogeny, or evolutionary history, in light of the fossil record and geologic time, but biologists also use molecular data, comparative anatomy, and other approaches to trace phylogeny. And tracing phylogeny is one of the main goals of systematics, the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Systematics includes taxonomy, which is the naming and classification of species and groups of species. Formal taxonomy began in the 18th century with Linnaeus's book Systema naturae, which translates as "System of Nature," meaning a classification of all known natural life. A century later, Darwin both anticipated the future direction of taxonomy and introduced the new science of systematics when he wrote in The Origin of Species that "our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies." In this section, we examine the connection between phylogeny and classification that is at the center of modern systematics.





 Sedimentary rocks are the richest source of fossils

Sedimentary rocks form from layers of minerals that settle out of water (see FIGURE 22.3). Sand and silt that are weathered and eroded from the land are carried by rivers to seas and swamps, where the particles settle to the bottom. Deposits pile up and compress the older sediments below into rock--sand into sandstone and mud into shale. When aquatic life-forms and terrestrial organisms swept into the seas and swamps die, they settle along with the sediments. A tiny fraction of them are then preserved as fossils. At any particular location, sedimentation is not continuous but occurs in intervals when the sea level changes or lakes and swamps dry up and refill. Even when a region is submerged, the rate of sedimentation and the types of sedimentary particles vary over time. As a result of these different periods of sedimentation, the rock forms in strata (see FIGURE 22.4).

The organic substances of a dead organism buried in sediments usually decay rapidly. However, hard parts that are rich in minerals, such as the shells of many invertebrates and protists and the bones and teeth of vertebrates, may remain as fossils (FIGURE 25.1a and b). Paleontologists have unearthed nearly complete skeletons of dinosaurs and other forms, but more often the finds consist of parts of skulls, bone fragments, or teeth. Many of these relics are hardened even more and preserved by chemical changes; under the right conditions, minerals dissolved in groundwater seep into the tissues of a dead organism and replace its organic material. The plant or animal turns to stone (see FIGURE 25.1c).

Rarer than mineralized fossils are those that retain organic material. They are sometimes discovered as thin films pressed between layers of sandstone or shale. For example, paleontologists have discovered plant leaves millions of years old that are still green with chlorophyll and well enough preserved for their organic composition to be analyzed and the ultrastructure of their cells to be explored with the electron microscope (see FIGURE 25.1d). The most common fossilized plant material is pollen, which has a hard organic case that resists degradation.

The fossils that paleontologists find in many of their digs are not the actual remnants of organisms at all, but rocks that form as replicas of the organisms. These fossils result when a dead organism captured in sediment decays and leaves an empty mold that becomes filled with minerals dissolved in water. The minerals may subsequently crystallize, forming a cast in the shape of the organism (see FIGURE 25.1e).

Trace fossils consist of footprints, animal burrows, or other impressions left in sediments by the activities of animals. These rocks are in essence fossilized behavior; they tell paleontologists something about how the animals that left the trace fossils lived. For example, dinosaur tracks provide clues about the animal's locomotion--its gait (pattern of leg movements), stride length, and speed (see FIGURE 25.1f).

If an organism happens to die in a place where bacteria and fungi cannot decompose the corpse, the entire body, including soft parts, may be preserved as a fossil. For example, the scorpion in FIGURE 25.1g got stuck in a drop of resin from a tree about 30 million years ago. The resin eventually hardened into amber, entombing the animal. There are other mechanisms that preserve whole organisms. Explorers have discovered mammoths, bison, and even prehistoric humans frozen in ice or preserved in acid bogs, where conditions retard decomposition (see FIGURE 25.1h). Such rare discoveries make the news, but biologists rely mainly on more common sedimentary fossils to reconstruct the history of life.





 Paleontologists use a variety of methods to date fossils

Fossils are reliable historical data only if we can determine their ages. Here we examine the methods for de termining where fossils fit on the geologic time scale.

Relative Dating

The trapping of dead organisms in sediments freezes fossils in time. Thus, the fossils in each stratum of sedimentary rock are a local sample of the organisms that existed at the time that sediment was deposited. Because younger sediments are superimposed upon older ones, this book of sedimentary pages tells the relative ages of fossils.

The strata at one location can often be correlated with strata at another location by the presence of similar fossils, known as index fossils. The best index fossils for correlating strata that are far apart are the shells of sea animals that were widespread. At any one location where a roadcut or canyon wall reveals layered rocks, there are likely to be gaps in the sequence. That area may have been above sea level during different periods, and thus no sedimentation occurred; or some of the sedimentary layers that were deposited when the area was submerged may have been scraped away by subsequent periods of erosion.

By studying many different sites, geologists have established a geologic time scale with a consistent sequence of historical periods (TABLE 25.1). These periods are grouped into four eras: the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. Each era represents a distinct age in the history of Earth and its life. For example, the Mesozoic era is sometimes called the "age of reptiles" because of its abundance of reptilian fossils, including dinosaurs. The boundaries between the eras correspond to times of mass extinctions, when many forms of life disappeared and were replaced by diversification of the survivors. Lesser extinctions also mark the boundaries of many of the periods that make up each era. The periods within each era are further subdivided into finer intervals called epochs (only the epochs of the current era, the Cenozoic, appear in TABLE 25.1). The timeline to the left of TABLE 25.1 shows that the geologic eras were not equal in duration. The periods also varied in length. For example, the Jurassic period lasted almost twice as long as the Triassic period. Scientists have not divided geologic time in an arbitrary manner, but have located boundaries in the record of the rocks that correspond to times of great change.

Table 25-1. The Geologic Time Scale





The record of the rocks is a serial that chronicles the relative ages of fossils; it tells us the order in which groups of species present in a sequence of strata evolved. However, the series of sedimentary rocks does not tell us the absolute ages of the embedded fossils. The difference is analogous to peeling the layers of wallpaper from the walls of a very old house that has been inhabited by many owners. You could determine the sequence in which the papers had been applied, but not the year that each layer was added.

Absolute Dating

"Absolute" dating does not mean errorless dating, but only that age is given in years instead of relative terms such as before and after, early and late. Radiometric dating, the measurement of certain radioactive isotopes in fossils or rocks, is the method most often used to determine the ages of rocks and fossils on a scale of absolute time. Fossils contain isotopes of elements that accumulated in the organisms when they were alive. For example, the carbon in a living organism includes both the most common carbon isotope, carbon-12, and a less common radioactive isotope, carbon-14, in the same ratio as is present in the atmosphere. Once an organism dies, it stops accumulating carbon. The radioactive carbon-14 that it contained at the time of death slowly decays and becomes another element, nitrogen-14, causing the proportion of carbon-14 to total carbon content to decline. Each radioactive isotope has a fixed rate of decay. An isotope's half-life, the number of years it takes for 50%  of the original sample to decay, is unaffected by temperature, pressure, and other environmental variables (FIGURE 25.2). Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years, a reliable rate of decay that can be used to date relatively young fossils. Thus, by measuring either the amount of nitrogen-14 in a fossil or the amount of carbon-14 remaining, we can determine the fossil's age.

Fig 25-2. Radiometric dating. The graph plots the decay of "parent" isotopes, usually radioactive isotopes, to form "daughter" isotopes. An example is the clocklike decay of carbon-14 to form nitrogen-14. Each type of radioactive isotope has a set half-life, the time required for 50%  of the isotope to decay. For example, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years; uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years. Paleontologists use such radiometric clocks as one method to date fossils or to infer the ages of fossils by dating surrounding rock.

Paleontologists use radioactive isotopes with longer half-lives to date older fossils. For example, uranium-238, which has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, has been used as a radiometric clock to infer the ages of fossils in rocks of the Cambrian period (see TABLE 25.1). Unlike carbon-14, uranium-238 is not present in living organisms. It occurs in molten lava and the volcanic rock that forms as the lava cools. After the volcanic rock forms, no more uranium-238 is incorporated, and the rock's original stock of the isotope decays slowly into lead-206 atoms. Thus, researchers can use the concentration of lead-206 to date volcanic rocks. And paleontologists can use these measurements to date very old fossils found near the volcanic rocks. For example, if fossils of animals are found in a rock layer sandwiched between two layers of volcanic rock that are 530 and 520 million years old, respectively, we can infer that the animals lived about 525 million years ago.

Methods other than radiometric dating can be used on some fossils. Amino acids exist in two isomers with either left-handed or right-handed symmetry, designated the L and D forms, respectively. Organisms synthesize only L-amino acids, which are incorporated into proteins. After an organism dies, however, its population of L-amino acids is slowly converted, resulting in a mixture of L- and D-amino acids. In a fossil, the ratio of L- and D-amino acids can be measured. Knowing the rate at which this chemical conversion, called racemization, takes place, we can determine how long the organism has been dead. For instance, archaeologists have used this method to date ostrich eggshells found along with fossils of early humans. The humans probably ate the eggs and used the shells for water bowls. Racemization, unlike radioactive decay, is temperature sensitive, meaning that past changes in climate made the racemization clock run faster or slower. But for fossils found in locations where climate apparently has not changed significantly since the fossils formed, the two dating methods agree closely on the age of the fossils.





 The fossil record is a substantial, but incomplete, chronicle of evolutionary history

The discovery of a fossil is the culmination of a sequence of improbable coincidences. First, the organism had to die in the right place at the right time for burial conditions to favor fossilization. Then the rock layer containing the fossil had to escape geologic processes that destroy or severely distort rocks, such as erosion, pressure from superimposed strata, or the melting of rocks that occurs at some locations. If the fossil was preserved, there is only a slight chance that a river carving a canyon or some other process will expose the rock containing the fossil. The chance that someone will find the fossil is even more remote, although, of course, discovery is more probable for people who are purposefully looking for fossils. No wonder the fossil record is incomplete: A substantial fraction of species that have lived probably left no fossils, most fossils that formed have been destroyed, and only a fraction of the existing fossils have been discovered.

The fossil record, far from being a complete sample of organisms of the past, is slanted in favor of species that existed for a long time, were abundant and widespread, and had shells or hard skeletons. Paleontologists, like all historians, must reconstruct the past from incomplete records. Even with its limitations, however, the fossil record is a remarkably detailed document of phylogeny over the vast scale of geologic time. The order of sedimentary strata records the sequence of biological change, and dating methods tell us approximately how long ago the changes occurred. Also recorded in rocks is the chronology of environmental changes associated with evolutionary changes in life. We now turn to some of the major changes in Earth's environments that have caused significant transformations of life.





 Phylogeny has a biogeographic basis in continental drift

Evolution has dimension in space as well as in time. Indeed, it was biogeography, even more than fossils, that first nudged Darwin and Wallace toward an evolutionary view of life. The history of Earth helps explain the current geographic distribution of species. For example, the emergence of volcanic islands such as the Gal&aacute;pagos opens new environments for founders that reach the outposts, and adaptive radiation fills many of the available niches with new species. On a global scale, the drifting of continents is the major geographic factor correlated with the spatial distribution of life and with such evolutionary episodes as mass extinctions and explosive increases in biological diversity.

The continents are not fixed, but drift about Earth's surface like passengers on great plates of crust floating on the hot, underlying mantle (FIGURE 25.3a). Unless two landmasses are embedded in the same plate, their positions relative to each other change. For example, North America and Europe are presently drifting apart at a rate of about 2 cm per year. Many important geologic processes, including mountain building, volcanism, and earthquakes, occur at plate boundaries (FIGURE 25.3b). California's infamous San Andreas Fault is part of a border where two plates slide past each other.

Fig 25-3. Earth's crustal plates and plate tectonics (geologic processes resulting from plate movements).

Plate movements rearrange geography incessantly, but two chapters in the continuing saga of continental drift had an especially strong influence on life. About 250 million years ago, near the end of the Paleozoic era, plate movements brought all the landmasses together into a supercontinent that has been named Pangaea, meaning "all land" (FIGURE 25.4, p. 490). Imagine some of the possible effects on life. Species that had been evolving in isolation came together and competed. When the landmasses coalesced, the total amount of shoreline was reduced, and there is evidence that the ocean basins increased in depth, which lowered sea level and drained the shallow coastal seas. Then, as now, most marine species inhabited shallow waters, and the formation of Pangaea destroyed a considerable amount of that habitat. It was probably a long, traumatic period for terrestrial life as well. The continental interior, which has a drier and more erratic climate than coastal regions, increased in area substantially when the land came together. Changing ocean currents also would have affected land life as well as sea life. The formation of Pangaea surely had a tremendous environmental impact that reshaped biological diversity by causing extinctions and providing new opportunities for taxonomic groups that survived the crisis.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 25-4. The history of continental drift. About 250 million years ago, all of Earth's landmasses were locked together in a supercontinent named Pangaea. About 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to split into northern (Laurasia) and southern (Gondwana) landmasses, which later separated into the modern continents. India collided with Eurasia just 10 million years ago, forming the Himalayas, the tallest and youngest of Earth's major mountain ranges. The continents continue to drift.

The second dramatic chapter in the history of continental drift was written about 180 million years ago, during the Mesozoic era. Pangaea began to break up, causing geographic isolation of colossal proportions. As the continents drifted apart, each became a separate evolutionary arena, and the faunas and floras of the different biogeographic realms diverged.

The pattern of continental mergings and separations is the solution to many biogeographic puzzles. For example, paleontologists have discovered matching fossils of Triassic reptiles in Ghana (West Africa) and Brazil. These two parts of the world, now separated by 3,000 km of ocean, were contiguous during the early Mesozoic era. Continental drift also explains much about the current distribution of organisms, such as why the Australian fauna and flora contrast so sharply with that of the rest of the world. The great diversity of marsupials (pouched mammals), which fill ecological roles in Australia analogous to those filled by eutherian (placental) mammals on other continents, is just one example of Australia's unique collection of species. Marsupials probably evolved first in what is now North America and reached Australia via South America and Antarctica while the continents were still joined. The subsequent breakup of the southern continents set Australia "afloat" like a great ark of marsupials. On Australia, marsupials evolved and diversified, while eutherian mammals evolved and diversified on other continents. Australia has been isolated for 50 million years. Bats, rats, mice, and humans (and their domesticated animals) are the only eutherian mammals that have managed to populate the island continent.





 The history of life is punctuated by mass extinctions

The fossil record reveals an episodic history, with long, relatively quiescent periods punctuated by briefer intervals when the turnover in species composition was much more extensive. These biological upheavals were times of mass extinctions followed by extensive diversification of certain taxonomic groups that escaped extinction. We will emphasize episodes of radiation of biological diversity in the next unit of chapters. Here we examine some examples of mass extinctions.

A species may become extinct because its habitat has been destroyed or because the environment has changed in a direction unfavorable to the species. If ocean temperatures fall by even a few degrees, many species that are otherwise beautifully adapted will perish. Even if physical factors in the environment are stable, biological factors may change; the environment in which a species lives includes the other organisms that live there, and evolutionary change in one species is likely to have some impact on other species in the community. For example, the evolution by some Cambrian animals of hard body parts, such as jaws and shells, may have made some organisms lacking hard parts more vulnerable to predation and thereby more prone to extinction.

Extinction is in fact inevitable in a changing world, and there have been crises in the history of life when global environmental changes have been so rapid and disruptive that a majority of species were swept away. Mass extinctions are known primarily from the decimation of hard-bodied animals that lived in shallow seas, the organisms for which the fossil record is most complete. The fossil record chronicles a number of mass extinctions, with five to seven of them particularly extensive. The two that have received the most attention are the Permian mass extinction, which occurred about 250 million years ago, and the Cretaceous mass extinction of about 65 million years ago.

The Permian mass extinction, which defines the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, claimed about 90%  of the species of marine animals. Terrestrial life also crashed; for example, 8 out of 27 orders of Permian insects did not survive into the Triassic, the next geologic period. This mass extinction occurred in less than 5 million years--possibly much less--an instant in the context of geologic time.

Several factors may have combined to cause radical environmental change during the late Permian. That was about the time the continents merged to form Pangaea, which disturbed many marine and terrestrial habitats and altered climate. Massive volcanic eruptions also occurred in what is now Siberia, constituting the most extreme episode of volcanism of the past half-billion years. Besides spewing lava and ash into the atmosphere, the Siberian volcanoes may have produced enough carbon dioxide to warm the global climate. Reduced temperature differences between the equator and the poles would have slowed the mixing of ocean water, which in turn would have reduced the amounts of oxygen available to marine organisms. An oxygen deficit in the oceans may have played a large role in the Permian extinctions.

The Cretaceous mass extinction of 65 million years ago delineates the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (FIGURE 25.5). That debacle doomed more than half the marine species and exterminated many families of terrestrial plants and animals, including the dinosaurs. The climate became cooler at that time, and shallow seas receded from continental lowlands. Large volcanic eruptions in what is now India may have contributed to the cooling by releasing material into the atmosphere that blocked sunlight. However, many scientists now favor the so-called impact hypothesis, which postulates that the main cause of the Cretaceous extinctions was a collision of an asteroid or large comet with Earth. Separating Mesozoic from Cenozoic sediments is a thin layer of clay enriched in iridium, an element very rare on Earth but common in meteorites and other extraterrestrial debris that occasionally fall to Earth. Walter and Luis Alvarez and their colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, studied the clay and suggested that it is fallout from a huge cloud of debris that billowed into the atmosphere when an asteroid hit Earth. The Alvarezes proposed that the great cloud would have blocked sunlight and severely disturbed climate for several months.

Fig 25-5. Diversity of life and periods of mass extinction. This graph, based on the fossil record of terrestrial and marine organisms, reveals a general increase in the diversity of organisms over time (red line and right vertical axis). Mass extinctions on land and in the oceans interrupted the buildup of diversity during many periods of geologic time (blue line and left vertical axis). In this figure, extinction events are estimated as percentages of taxonomic families that died out relative to the number extant in each period of geologic time. Of the two mass extinction periods labeled in the figure, the Permian mass extinction claimed more than 90%  of species on land and in the seas, whereas the extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous probably wiped out more than half of all species, including the dinosaurs.

The impact hypothesis really has two parts: that such a collision occurred and that the event caused the Cretaceous extinctions. Much evidence in addition to the iridium layer supports the first part of the hypothesis--that a large comet or small asteroid crashed into Earth 65 million years ago. Earth is pocked with enough craters to tell us that many large objects have fallen on the planet in the past. Recent research has focused on the Chicxulub crater, a 65-million-year-old scar located beneath sediments on the Yucat&eacute;n coast of Mexico. About 180 km in diameter, the Chicxulub crater is about the right size to have been caused by an asteroid with a diameter of about 10 km.

Critical evaluation of the impact hypothesis now focuses on the second claim--that the collision caused the Cretaceous extinctions. Advocates of the impact hypothesis argue that the impact was large enough to darken the Earth for years, not months, and that the resulting reduction of photosynthesis would have lasted long enough for food chains to collapse. Some of the minerals in the dust cloud would also have caused severe acid precipitation (see Chapter 3). The crater's horseshoelike shape, along with evidence from sediments deposited during the late Cretaceous, indicates to some scientists that the Chicxulub asteroid struck Earth at a low angle from the southeast (FIGURE 25.6). Such an impact would have sent white-hot debris to the northwest, setting off a firestorm that within minutes would have killed most land plants and animals on the North American continent. This scenario could explain fossil evidence that extinction rates of species in North America were more severe and occurred in a briefer time than elsewhere. Less severe global effects would have developed more slowly after the initial catastrophe, which would explain why extinction rates during the late Cretaceous do not seem to have been uniform around the globe.

Fig 25-6. Trauma for planet Earth and its Cretaceous life. The 65-million-year-old Chicxulub impact crater is located in the Caribbean Sea near the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula of Mexico. The horseshoe shape of the crater and the pattern of debris in sedimentary rocks indicate that an asteroid or comet struck at a low angle from the southeast. This artist's interpretation represents the impact and its immediate effect-- a cloud of hot vapor and debris that could have killed most of the plants and animals in North America within minutes.

Although the debate over the impact hypothesis has muted somewhat, researchers maintain a healthy skepticism about the link between the Chicxulub impact event and the period of mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. The original Alvarez hypothesis triggered a strong research effort, fueled in part by its opponents, who contend that changes in climate due to continental drift, increased volcanism, and other processes on Earth, rather than extraterrestrial causes, could have caused mass extinction 65 million years ago. As some researchers point out, hypotheses about the Cretaceous extinctions may not be mutually exclusive. It is possible that an asteroid impact was the sudden final blow in an environmental assault on late Cretaceous life that included more gradual processes. And such collisions may have played roles in other mass extinctions. For example, in 2001, a research team reported geologic evidence that the Permian extinctions, the greatest dying of all, corresponded in time to an asteroid collision with Earth.

Whatever the causes, mass extinctions affect biological diversity profoundly. But there is a creative side to the destruction. The species that manage to survive these crises, whether by their adaptive qualities or by sheer luck, become the stock for new radiations that fill many of the biological roles vacated or newly created by the extinctions. We will trace several examples of such radiations in Unit Five.





 Taxonomy employs a hierarchical system of classification

The Linnaean system has two main characteristics: a two-part name for each species and a hierarchical classification of species into broader and broader groups of organisms.

The Binomial

Taxonomists assign to each species a two-part latinized name, or binomial. The first part of a binomial is the genus (plural, genera) to which the species belongs. The second part of a binomial, the specific epithet, refers to one species within the genus. An example of a binomial is Panthera pardus, the scientific name for the large cat we commonly call the leopard. Notice that the first letter of the genus is capitalized and that the whole binomial is italicized and latinized. (You can name a bug you discover after a friend, but you must add the appropriate Latin ending.)

Common names--such as cat, bear, finch, and lilac--often work well in informal communication, but they can be ambiguous because there are many species of each of these kinds of organisms. When biologists publish their research, they refer to the organisms they have studied with scientific names (binomials) to avoid ambiguity. Many of the scientific names in use today date back to Linnaeus, who assigned binomials to over 11,000 species of plants and animals. In fact, perhaps in a show of optimism, Linnaeus assigned to humans the scientific name Homo sapiens, which means "wise man."

Hierarchical Classification

In addition to identifying and naming species, a major objective of systematics is to group species into broader taxonomic categories. The first step of such a hierarchical classification is built into the binomial for a species. We group species that are closely related into the same genus. For example the leopard, Panthera pardus, belongs to a genus that also includes the African lion (Panthera leo) and the tiger (Panthera tigris). Grouping species is natural for us--a way for us to structure our view of the world. We lump together several trees we know as oaks and distinguish them from several other species of trees we call maples. Indeed, oaks and maples belong to separate genera. Biology's taxonomic scheme formalizes our tendency to group related objects.

Beyond the grouping of species within genera, taxonomy extends to progressively broader categories of classification. It places related genera in the same family, puts families into orders, orders into classes, classes into phyla (singular, phylum), phyla into kingdoms, and kingdoms into domains. Each taxonomic level is more comprehensive than the previous one. All species of cats are mammals, but not all mammals are cats. The named taxonomic unit at any level is called a taxon (plural, taxa). For example, Pinus is a taxon at the genus level, the generic name for the various species of pine trees. Mammalia, a taxon at the class level, includes all the many orders of mammals. Only the genus name and specific epithet are italicized, and all taxa at the genus level and beyond are capitalized.

FIGURE 25.7 places the leopard in this taxonomic scheme of groups within groups. Classifying a species by kingdom, phylum, and so on, is analogous to sorting mail, first by zip code and then by street, house number, and specific member of the household. The phylogenetic trees that systematists construct reflect the hierarchical classification of taxonomic groups nested within more inclusive groups. FIGURE 25.8 illustrates the connection between phylogeny and classification with a simplified tree that includes the leopard.

Fig 25-7. Hierarchical classification. The taxonomic scheme classifies species into groups belonging to more comprehensive groups. The leopard (Panthera pardus) belongs to the genus Panthera, which also includes the African lion and tiger. These wild felines belong to the cat family (Felidae), along with the genus Felis, which includes the domestic cat and several closely related wild cats, such as the lynx. Family Felidae belongs to the order Carnivora, which also includes the dog family, Canidae, and several other families. Order Carnivora, the carnivores, is grouped with many other orders in the class Mammalia, the mammals. Mammalia is one of several classes belonging to the phylum Chordata in the kingdom Animalia. The domain is an even broader taxonomic level. Domain Eukarya includes Kingdom Animalia and all other eukaryotic organisms.

 Modern phylogenetic systematics is based on cladistic analysis

Classification based on evolutionary history is called phylogenetic systematics. So far, we have assumed that the phylogeny of a group of species is already known, and then we have applied that knowledge to a hierarchical classification of the species (see FIGURE 25.8). But how do we reconstruct evolutionary history to draw phylogenetic trees in the first place? The fossil record helps, of course. Assessing relationships between living species by comparing their anatomy also provides data. And comparing two species' DNA (or proteins) gets to their hereditary relationships at the molecular level. But how do systematists evaluate all this information and apply it to tree building and classification? Today, most systematists practice what is called cladistic analysis, or simply cladistics. We can trace the seeds of this revolution in systematics to a book that German entomologist (insect specialist) Willi Hennig wrote 50 years ago. Let's examine some of the key elements of cladistic analysis.

Clades: Monophyletic Groups

A phylogenetic diagram based on cladistics is called a cladogram. It is a tree constructed from a series of dichotomies, or two-way branch points. Each branch point represents the divergence of two species from a common ancestor. For example, we could represent a branching within the cat family this way: 



 We can also diagram dichotomous branching of taxa more inclusive than species, such as families or orders: 





The "deeper" branch point represents evolutionary divergence from an ancestor common to both the cat and dog families. The sequence of branching symbolizes historical chronology; the last ancestor common to both the cat and dog families lived longer ago than the last ancestor shared by leopards and domestic cats.

Each evolutionary branch in a cladogram is called a clade (from the Greek clados, branch). Notice that clades, like taxonomic levels, can be nested within larger clades. For example, the cat family represents a clade within a larger clade that also includes the dog family. But not all groupings of organisms qualify as clades. A clade consists of an ancestral species and all of its descendants. Such a group of species, be it a genus, family, or some higher taxa, is said to be monophyletic, which means "single tribe."FIGURE 25.9 contrasts a monophyletic group, or clade, with groupings of species that are unacceptable in the practice of cladistics.

Fig 25-9. Monophyletic versus paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups.

Constructing a Cladogram

How do systematists decide on the sequence of branching in a cladogram? Put another way, how can we determine the similarities between species that are relevant for grouping the species as a clade? This can be quite a challenge. The first complication is that not all similarity represents common ancestry.

Sorting Homology from Analogy. Recall from Chapter 22 that likeness attributed to shared ancestry is called homology. The forelimbs of mammals are homologous; that is, the similarity in the intricate skeleton that supports the limbs has a genealogical basis (see FIGURE 22.14).

There is a wild card in this game of making evolutionary connections by evaluating similarity: Not all likeness qualifies as homology. Species from different evolutionary branches may come to resemble one another if they have similar ecological roles and natural selection has shaped analogous adaptations. This is called convergent evolution, and similarity due to convergence is called analogy, not homology (FIGURE 25.10). The wings of bats and those of birds, for example, are analogous flight equipment. The fossil record documents that bat wings and bird wings evolved independently from walking forelimbs of different ancestors. (Note that homology, like taxonomy, can be hierarchical; though the forelimbs of bats and birds are analogous as wings, they are homologous as forelimbs descendant from the basic vertebrate prototype limb.)

Fig 25-10. Convergent evolution and analogous structures. (a) The ocotillo of southwestern North America looks remarkably similar to (b) the allauidia found in Madagascar. The plants are not closely related and owe their resemblance to analogous adaptations that evolved independently in response to similar environmental pressures.

As a general rule, the greater the number of homologous parts between two species, the more closely the species are related, and this should be reflected in their classification. This guideline is simpler in principle than it is in practice. Adaptation can obscure homologies, and convergence can create misleading analogies. As we saw in Chapter 22, comparing the embryonic development of the features in question can often expose homology that is not apparent in the mature structures.

There is another clue to identifying homology and sorting it from analogy: The more complex two similar structures are, the less likely it is they evolved independently. Consider the skulls of a human and a chimpanzee, for example. The skulls are not single bones, but a fusion of many, and the two skulls match almost perfectly, bone for bone. It is highly improbable that such complex structures matching in so many details could have separate origins. Most likely, the genes required to build these skulls were inherited from a common ancestor.

Identifying Shared Derived Characters. Beyond separating homologous from analogous similarity, systematists must sort through the homologies to identify what are called shared derived characters. "Character" here refers to any feature that a particular taxon possesses. The characters that are relevant to phylogeny, of course, are the homologous ones. For example, hair is a character shared by all mammals. But so is a backbone. The presence of a backbone cannot help us distinguish mammals from other vertebrates because nonmammalian vertebrates such as fishes and reptiles also have backbones. In other words, the backbone is a homology that predates the branching of the mammalian clade from the vertebrate tree; it is a shared primitive character, a homology common to a taxon more inclusive than the one we're trying to define. In contrast, hair is a homology found only in the vertebrates called mammals; in comparing mammals to other vertebrates, hair is a shared derived character, meaning an evolutionary novelty unique to a particular clade. The following flowchart summarizes the types of similarities between species: 



 Note that the backbone can also qualify as a shared derived character, but at a deeper branch point that distinguishes all vertebrates from other animals. Among vertebrates, the backbone is a shared primitive character because it evolved in the ancestor common to all vertebrates. Thus, the sequence of branching in a cladogram represents the sequence in which evolutionary novelties, or shared derived characters, evolved.

Performing Outgroup Comparison. As a key step in cladistic analysis, systematists use a method called outgroup comparison to differentiate shared characters that are derived from those that are primitive. Let's work with the simplified case of ordering five vertebrates--a leopard, a turtle, a salamander, a tuna, and a creature called a lamprey--into a cladogram. As a basis of comparison, we need to designate an outgroup, which is a species or group of species that is closely related to the species we are studying, but known to be less closely related than any study-group members are to each other (based on evidence from paleontology, analysis of embryonic development, and molecular biology, for example). A good choice of an outgroup in our example is an animal called a lancelet. The five vertebrates we are studying make up the ingroup, and we can begin building our cladogram by comparing this ingroup with the outgroup.

Outgroup comparison is based on the assumption that homologies present in both the outgroup and the ingroup must be primitive characters that were already present in the ancestor common to both groups. In our study case, an example of such a character is a structure called a notochord, a flexible rod running the length of the animal. (In vertebrates, the notochord is present in embryos, but the only vestiges of the structure in adults of many vertebrates are the rubbery disks between the vertebrae of the backbone.) The species making up the ingroup display a mixture of shared primitive and shared derived characters. The outgroup comparison enables us to focus on just those characters that were derived at the various branch points of vertebrate evolution. FIGURE 25.11a tabulates examples of these characters. Note that all the vertebrates in the ingroup have backbones; thus, this is a shared primitive character that was present in the ancestral vertebrate, though not in the outgroup. Now note that the presence of jaws is a character absent in lampreys but present in other members of the ingroup. Thus, this character helps us identify the earliest branch point in the vertebrate clade. FIGURE 25.11b illustrates how the data in our table of homologies translate into a cladogram.

Summary of Cladistic Analysis

A cladogram represents the chronological sequence of branching during the evolutionary history of a set of organisms. Systematists infer this branching sequence by analyzing homologies, identifying the shared derived characters unique to each clade. In FIGURE 25.11b, for example, we can infer from cladistic analysis that the turtle-leopard clade includes a common ancestor that is more recent than the ancestor of the salamander-turtle-leopard clade.

Do not confuse this chronology of phylogenetic branching with the vintages of the organisms we are comparing. For example, the cladogram in FIGURE 25.11b does not indicate that all turtles evolved more recently than all salamanders, but only that their common ancestor preceded the ancestor of the turtle-leopard clade. A particular species of turtle may be a very old member of that clade, while the salamander species used in the cladistic analysis may be a relatively recent member of an older clade. This is analogous to an early building in a relatively new city being older than a new building in a more ancient city. Note also that the chronology represented in a cladogram is relative (earlier versus later) rather than absolute (so many millions of years ago). Many of the evolutionary trees you will see in the next unit of chapters and elsewhere in this book are based on a combination of cladistic analysis and the use of fossil evidence and other data to place the phylogenetic branch points in the context of geologic time. (See FIGURE 29.1 for an example.)

Systematists can use the cladograms they construct to place species in the taxonomic hierarchy of groups within groups, reflecting the nesting of clades within more comprehensive clades. FIGURE 25.12, page 498, applies this principle to a group of mammals.

Fig 25-12. Cladistics and taxonomy. We can use the pattern of clades nested within clades to order species into a hierarchy of higher taxa. In this cladogram of mammals, a reptile (turtle) serves as the outgroup. The crossbars preceding branch points along the cladogram are labeled with examples of derived characters that evolved in the ancestor of each clade.

Some systematists now argue that the hierarchical system of classification is antiquated because it is so disruptive to rearrange taxa when a cladogram is revised based on new evidence. These systematists propose replacing the Linnaean system with a strictly cladistic classification called phylocode. Advocates of this alternative taxonomy simply name clades without the hierarchical tags, such as class, order, and family. For example, two clades we can extract from FIGURE 25.11b might be named clade Vertebrata and clade Amniota (the vertebrates with amniotic, or shelled, eggs). So far, most biologists still prefer a hierarchical system of taxonomic levels as a more useful way of organizing the diversity of life.

Each diagram of phylogeny, be it a cladogram or an evolutionary tree that incorporates a time scale, represents a hypothesis or a set of hypotheses about how the organisms in the tree are related. New evidence can compel systematists to revise their trees. And such reassessment has accelerated with the application of molecular methods for comparing species and tracing phylogeny.





 Systematists can infer phylogeny from molecular data

When tracing phylogeny and classifying organisms, it is useful to compare macromolecules as well as anatomical characters. If homology reflects common ancestry, then comparing the genes and gene products (proteins) of organisms gets right to the heart of their evolutionary relationships. Sequences of nucleotides in DNA are inherited, and they program corresponding sequences of amino acids in proteins. At the molecular level, the evolutionary divergence of species parallels the accumulation of differences in their genomes. The more recently two species have branched from a common ancestor, the more similar their DNA and amino acid sequences should be. Today, both the amino acid sequences for many proteins and the nucleotide sequences for a rapidly expanding archive of DNA from diverse species are in databases available via the Internet. This has catalyzed a boom in systematics, as researchers use the databases to trace phylogeny by comparing the hereditary information of different species.

Molecular systematics makes it possible to assess phylogenetic relationships that cannot be measured by comparative anatomy and other nonmolecular methods. One application is comparison of species too closely related to display much divergence in morphology. At the other extreme, molecular systematics makes it possible to trace evolutionary relationships of species that are so different that there is little morphological homology; for example, it would be impossible to tell from morphology that fungi are more closely related to animals than they are to plants. Thus, molecular biology helps extend phylogenetic systematics to the extremes of evolutionary relationships, to the major branches and the finest twigs of the tree of life.

Phylogenetic Data from DNA Sequences

Systematists use a variety of methods to compare the proteins and nucleic acids of species, but most research is now based on comparison of nucleotide sequences in DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide position along a stretch of DNA represents an inherited character in the form of one of the four DNA bases: A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cytosine), or T (thymine). Thus, homologous regions of DNA from two species that are 1,000 nucleotides long provide 1,000 points of comparison. And a systematist may compare several DNA regions to assess the relationship between two species. Automated DNA sequencers enable researchers to collect an enormous amount of data, and computers make it possible to analyze the extensive quantity of genetic information. This DNA sequence analysis provides a quantitative tool for constructing cladograms with branch points defined by mutations in DNA sequence that mark each clade--the shared derived characters of molecular systematics.

The rates of change in DNA sequences over evolutionary time vary from one part of the genome to another. The DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) changes relatively slowly, so comparisons of DNA sequences in these genes (or their products, rRNA) is useful for investigating relationships between taxa that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago. For example, systematists have focused on rRNA genes to help sort out the phylogeny of the animal phyla. In contrast, the DNA in mitochondria (mtDNA) evolves relatively rapidly. Thus, some systematists compare mtDNA sequences to assess the phylogeny of species that are relatively closely related or even populations of the same species. For example, one research team used mtDNA sequences to trace the relationships between different groups of Native Americans. Their results corroborate evidence that the Pima of Arizona, the Maya of Mexico, and the Yanomami of Venezuela are closely related, probably descending from the first of three waves of immigrants to cross the Bering Land Bridge from Asia to the Americas during the glaciation of the late Pleistocene epoch.

Aligning the DNA Sequences

DNA comparisons pose technical challenges. The first step in analyzing the genetic data is to align homologous DNA sequences from the two species we are comparing. If the two species have diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently, the sequences of homologous regions of DNA will probably be identical in length. Of course, along this homologous sequence, the two species may differ in which base is present at one or a few sites. In contrast, less closely related species may have homologous DNA sequences that differ not only in the bases at certain sites but also in their total length. This is because of an accumulation over evolutionary time of mutations such as insertions and deletions that alter the lengths of genes (see Chapter 17). Suppose, for example, that two DNA sequences were very similar, but a deletion mutation eliminated the first base of the sequence in one of the species. This would shift the remaining sequence forward a notch, and a point-by-point comparison of the two sequences would then distort what in fact is a very good match. FIGURE 25.13 illustrates a simplified example of how systematists use computer programs to align homologous DNA segments that differ in length.

Fig 25-13. Aligning segments of DNA. This simplified example illustrates how insertion and deletion mutations can alter the length of DNA segments and make point-by-point comparison between two species challenging. Systematists use computer programs that search for similar sequences along the DNA segments from the two species. The programs then reestablish alignment by inserting gaps in one DNA segment to compensate for mutations that altered sequence length. This now makes it possible to compare sequences in homologous regions along the DNA segments. (In this example, the homologous sequences are identical.)





 The principle of parsimony helps systematists reconstruct phylogeny

We can use DNA sequence data to learn more about general systematic theory. After sequence alignment and the point-by-point comparisons of base sequences in homologous DNA from a set of species, systematists may convert the data to phylogenetic trees. In making the sequence comparisons, each base change--say, a point mutation that changes a G to an A--counts as one evolutionary event. Challenged with many such base changes throughout a set of species, a systematist has quite a phylogenetic puzzle to solve. If there are only a few species in the set, then the number of ways to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the DNA sequence data is not too large (FIGURE 25.14, p. 500). But let's say a systematist is trying to construct a phylogeny for 50 species. About 3 &#160;X&#160; 1076 trees are possible for a 50-species problem! Even a supercomputer would take too long to search for the tree that best fits the DNA data. But for more manageable data sets, systematists can screen the tree variations by using a principle called parsimony.

Fig 25-14. Simplified version of a four-species problem in phylogenetics. Here are just three of the many possible trees we can draw for the phylogeny of four closely related species of birds.

Applied to science, the principle of parsimony states that a theory about nature should be the simplest explanation that is consistent with the facts. In other words, "keep it simple." The parsimony principle is sometimes called "Occam's Razor," in honor of William of Occam, a 14th-century English philosopher who is held to have advocated this minimalist approach to problem solving. (The "razor" refers to the shaving off of unneeded complications.) Six centuries later, the philosopher Bertrand Russell reinforced the principle of parsimony with these words: "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer."

Systematists apply the principle of parsimony to construct phylogenetic trees that represent the smallest number of evolutionary changes. In the case of cladograms based on morphological characters, the most parsimonious tree is the one that requires the fewest evolutionary events in the form of shared derived characters. FIGURE 25.15 (pp. 500-501) walks you through the construction of the most parsimonious tree based on DNA sequence data for the relatively simple case of the four-species problem introduced in FIGURE 25.14. For species sets much larger, we would need a computer to serve as an electronic razor to shave away all the possible trees that are unnecessarily complicated in our quest for parsimony.

 Phylogenetic trees are hypotheses

Considering how most of us struggle to understand biological complexity, especially in molecular biology, it is certainly not intuitive that parsimony should be our guide. Given a choice of many possible phylogenetic trees that we could draw based on DNA sequence data, why should we prefer the one with the fewest number of evolutionary changes as our best hypothesis for the relationships among a set of species? The rationale is that for any of a species' characters, whether molecular or morphological, hereditary fidelity is more common than change. At the molecular level, point mutations do occasionally change a base within a DNA sequence. But exact transmission of the sequence from generation to generation is thousands of times more common than change. The same rationale applies to morphology. For example, humans and apes share a number of skeletal novelties not found in other primates (the mammalian order that includes monkeys, apes, and humans). We could construct a primate phylogeny that places humans and apes on relatively distant clades. However, such a cladogram would assume the unnecessarily complicated scenario that a whole set of skeletal changes evolved twice in separate ancestors instead of just once in an ancestor common to apes and humans. The most parsimonious cladogram of primates, whether based on morphological or molecular data, places humans and apes as very close relatives.

This is a good time to reinforce the point that any phylogenetic diagram is a hypothesis. Given a choice of possible trees we can draw for a set of species or higher taxa, the best hypothesis is the one that is the best fit for all the available data. In the absence of conflicting information, the most parsimonious tree is the logical choice among alternative hypotheses. But sometimes there may be compelling evidence that the best hypothesis is a phylogeny that is not the most parsimonious. Perhaps the particular morphological or molecular character we are using to sort taxa actually did evolve multiple times. For example, both birds and mammals have hearts with four chambers (two atria and two ventricles; see Chapter 42). And we know from the fossil record that both birds and mammals evolved from reptiles. The parsimonious assumption for the four-chambered heart would be that it evolved once and was present in a reptilian ancestor common to birds and mammals (FIGURE 25.16a). But abundant evidence indicates that birds and mammals evolved from different reptilian ancestors. Thus, the four-chambered heart evolved at least twice in vertebrate history. This fact is inconsistent with the tree in FIGURE 25.16a, but consistent with the tree in FIGURE 25.16b.

Fig 25-16. Parsimony and the analogy-versus-homology pitfall. The tree in (a) places a bird and a mammal on a clade that excludes the lizard. The tree in (b) recognizes a lizard-bird clade. If we made the mistake of interpreting the four-chambered hearts of birds and mammals as homologous instead of analogous, we might opt for the tree in (a) as our most parsimonious hypothesis. In fact, an abundance of evidence supports the hypothesis that birds and lizards are closer relatives than birds and mammals.

In this example of vertebrate hearts, the problem is not so much with the principle of parsimony as it is with the analogy-homology issue; the four-chambered hearts of birds and mammals are analogous, not homologous. A matching change of bases in DNA sequences in two species can also occur independently; parsimony only suggests that such double changes in molecular evolution are less likely than inheritance of a single change from a common ancestor. The practice of parsimony in molecular systematics is more reliable if a phylo genetic tree is based on a large database of DNA sequence comparisons for the set of species in the tree. Similarly, occasionally misjudging an analogous similarity in morphology as a shared derived homology is less likely to distort a phylogenetic tree if each clade in the tree is defined by several derived characters. And the strongest phylogenetic hypotheses of all are those supported by both the molecular and morphological evidence, and, if it exists, by the fossil evidence.





 Molecular clocks may keep track of evolutionary time

The timing of evolutionary history in TABLE 25.1 is based mainly on the fossil record. In the past few decades, however, molecular biology has provided an independent method for placing the origin of taxonomic groups in time. Called molecular clocks, these new timing methods are based on the observation that at least some regions of genomes evolve at constant rates. If certain homologous DNA sequences or their protein products are compared for taxa that are known to have diverged from common ancestors during certain periods in the past, the number of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions is proportional to the time that has elapsed since the lineages branched. For example, the homologous proteins of bats and dolphins are much more alike than are those of sharks and tuna. This is consistent with the fossil evidence that sharks and tuna have been on separate evolutionary paths much longer than bats and dolphins. In this case, molecular divergence has kept better track of the time than have changes in morphology.

Using Molecular Clocks to Measure Absolute Time

It's one thing to use molecular clocks to help assess the relative chronology of branching in phylogeny--that sharks and tuna diverged earlier than bats and dolphins did, for example. But how accurate are molecular clocks for keeping absolute time? No genes mark time with precise tick-tock accuracy in their rates of base sequence changes. In fact, some regions of genomes evolve in fits and starts that are not at all clocklike. And even those genes that make good molecular clocks are accurate only in the statistical sense of a fairly smooth average rate of change; over time, there may still be chance deviations above and below that average rate.

For a gene having a reliable average rate of evolution, the molecular clock can be calibrated in actual time. This is done by graphing the number of amino acid or nucleotide differences against the times for a series of evolutionary branch points known from the fossil record. The graph line representing the evolution rate of the molecular clock can then be used to estimate how long ago certain evolutionary episodes that cannot be discerned from the fossil record occurred--the origin of a species or some higher taxa, for example.

Some biologists remain skeptical about the accuracy of molecular clocks. The regularity of some genes as molecular clocks implies that much of the change in DNA sequences is due to genetic drift and that the changes are mostly neutral--neither adaptive nor detrimental. Molecular evolution due to natural selection favoring certain DNA changes over others would probably be too irregular to mark time accurately. Thus, the skepticism of some scientists about molecular clocks partly reflects a more general debate about the extent to which neutral genetic variation can account for DNA diversity. Biologists who doubt some of the evolutionary conclusions based on molecular clocks are also critical of extrapolation to time spans beyond what has been calibrated to the fossil record. For example, molecular clocks that have been calibrated to fossil history extending back a few hundred million years have on occasion been used to attach time to evolutionary divergence that occurred a billion or more years ago. If molecular clocks are used judiciously, however, they will continue to help evolutionary biologists reconstruct the past.

Using a Molecular Clock to Date the Origin of HIV

In the year 2000, a research team at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico used a molecular clock to date the origin of HIV infections in humans. The pathogen HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. The virus descended from related viruses that infect chimpanzees and another primate called the sooty mangabey (the viruses do not cause any AIDS-like diseases in these nonhuman hosts). When did the virus jump from its simian hosts to first infect humans? The question does not have a simple answer because the virus has spread to humans more than once. These multiple origins of HIV are reflected in the various major strains (genetic types) of the virus that cause AIDS in humans. The most widespread strain in the global AIDS epidemic is HIV-1 M. Because HIV evolves very rapidly, samples of the virus differ even when taken from patients who were infected with HIV-1 M just a few years apart. To pinpoint the time of the earliest HIV-1 M infection, the Los Alamos researchers calibrated a molecular clock by comparing DNA sequences in a specific HIV gene obtained from patients sampled at different times in the history of the epidemic. The data enabled the scientists to project backward to the 1930s as the probable time of the first HIV-1 M invasion of humans (FIGURE 25.17, p. 504).

The numerous dots in the upper right-hand corner of this graph are based on DNA sequences for a specific HIV gene in blood samples collected from patients at different known times. The scale on the y axis is a measure of the number of base changes in the gene serving as the molecular clock. Note that during the span of time that the HIV samples were collected from the patients in this data set, between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, the gene evolved at a relatively consistent rate. If we project that rate backward in time, we intersect the time axis (x axis) of the graph during the 1930s. The team that published this research concluded that the HIV-1 M strain first infected humans in the 1930s.





 Modern systematics is flourishing with lively debate

Systematics is thriving today at the interface of modern evolutionary biology and current taxonomic theory. Biologists have been accumulating phenotypic information, mainly morphological, about diverse species, living and extinct, for centuries. The development of cladistics provided more objective methods for comparing morphology and incorporating the data into phylogenetic hypotheses, or cladograms. Molecular systematics added a powerful new tool in comparative biology, extending the analysis of phylogenetic relationships down to the level of DNA.

Cladistic analysis and molecular systematics, complemented by a revival of interest in paleontology and comparative biology in the past few decades, are stimulating a reassessment of phylogeny that is bringing us closer to understanding the history of life on Earth. In many cases, independent approaches, such as paleontology and DNA sequencing, converge in supporting a particular phylogenetic hypothesis. For example, the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and molecular comparisons all concur that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to lizards and snakes, a conclusion that probably would have surprised Linnaeus and Darwin (FIGURE 25.18).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 25-18. Modern systematics is shaking some phylogenetic trees. In our traditional vertebrate taxonomy, crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and other reptiles are classified in the class Reptilia, while birds are placed in a separate class (Aves). But most vertebrate systematists now agree that crocodiles are actually more closely related to birds than they are to lizards and snakes. Thus, the class Reptilia, in its traditional form, is paraphyletic, not monophyletic (see FIGURE 25.9).

In other cases, molecular data are at odds with other evidence, such as the fossil record. One such debate centers on the origin of the major groups (orders) of mammals. The oldest fossils of mammals date back 220 million years, into the Triassic period (see TABLE 25.1). However, fossils documenting the origin of most modern mammalian orders are much younger, dating to the early Tertiary period, about 60 million years ago, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. In apparent contradiction of the fossil evidence, molecular clocks push the origin of the major mammalian orders back closer to 100 million years ago. Many researchers place more trust in the fossil evidence and express doubts about whether the molecular clocks are reliable. The counterargument is that the paleontologists have not yet documented an earlier origin for most mammalian orders because the fossil record is incomplete. Between these two extremes is a phylogenetic fuse hypothesis: Perhaps the modern mammalian orders originated about 100 million years ago, but did not proliferate extensively enough to be noticeable in the fossil record until after the extinction of the dinosaurs almost 40 million years later (FIGURE 25.19). Additional research may help to resolve the debate about mammalian history.

Fig 25-19. When did most major mammalian orders originate? These simplified trees include just four orders of mammals. (a) According to the fossil record, the orders are tens of millions of years younger than the age inferred from (b) molecular clocks. (c) A possible reconciliation is the "phylogenetic fuse" hypothesis of an earlier origin followed by a later diversification within the orders. According to this hypothesis, the "explosion," symbolized in the diagram by the thicker lines, made the animals abundant and widespread enough to show up in the fossil record.

Note again that the cladistic approach focuses only on the sequence of phylogenetic branching in evolution, not on the degree of evolutionary divergence between branches. To appreciate this distinction, return to FIGURE 25.18. A strict practitioner of cladistics would argue that a taxonomic separation of crocodiles and birds in the vertebrate classes Reptilia and Aves, respectively, is obsolete. Other evolutionary biologists counter that a useful taxonomy should reflect both features of phylogenetic trees: the sequence of branching and the extent of divergence between branches. In the case of birds, many biologists still prefer to assign them to a class separate from all reptiles because the evolutionary adaptations of birds associated with flight have been so extensive. We will examine many such debates about classification in the next unit of chapters, which surveys the diversity of life in an evolutionary context.

In this unit, we have seen how the Darwinian theme of descent with modification has shaped all of biology. We have also seen that evolutionary theory itself has evolved as new methods, new data, and new ideas have continued to refine our view of life. Vigorous debate is vital to that progress and is a healthy sign that evolutionary biology is a robust science.

Life is a continuum extending from the earliest organisms through various phylogenetic branches to the great variety of forms alive today. In Unit Five, we will survey the diversity of life today and trace the evolution of this diversity over 3.8 billion years of history.

One of this book's ten themes is the interaction between organisms and their environments (see Chapter 1). We will see examples throughout this unit in the connections between biological history and geologic history. Geologic events that alter environments change the course of biological evolution. The formation and subsequent breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, for instance, had a tremendous impact on the diversity of life (see Chapter 25). Conversely, life has changed the planet it inhabits. For example, the evolution of photosynthetic organisms that release oxygen into the air had a dramatic impact on Earth's atmosphere. (This early photosynthetic life included prokaryotes similar to those in the dense mats that resemble stepping stones in the painting of early Earth on this page.) Much more recently, the emergence of Homo sapiens has changed the land, water, and air on a scale and at a rate unprecedented for a single species. The histories of Earth and its life are inseparable.

These chapters also emphasize key junctures in evolution that have punctuated the history of biological diversity. Geologic history and biological history have been episodic, marked by what were in essence revolutions that opened many new ways of life.

Historical study of any sort is an inexact discipline that depends on the preservation, reliability, and interpretation of past records. The fossil record of past life is generally less and less complete the farther into the past we delve. Fortunately, each organism alive today carries traces of its evolutionary history in its molecules, metabolism, and anatomy. As we saw in Unit Four, such traces are clues to the past that augment the fossil record. Still, the evolutionary episodes of greatest antiquity are generally the most obscure.

This chapter begins with an overview of life's history. We then take a closer look at the origin of life. That discussion is the most speculative in the entire unit, for no fossil record of that seminal episode exists. The last section of the chapter introduces the main branches of life as a prelude to the survey of biological diversity in Chapters 27-34

 Debate about the origin of life abounds



The question of how life began is more specifically about the genesis of prokaryotes. Sometime between about 4.0 billion years ago, when Earth's crust began to solidify, and 3.5 billion years ago, when the planet was inhabited by bacteria advanced enough to build stromatolites, the first organisms came into being. What was their origin? We will never know for sure, of course, how life on Earth began. But science seeks natural causes for natural phenomena, and that is the approach that must guide scientific inquiry about the origin of life





THE MAJOR LINEAGES OF LIFE

 

 The five-kingdom system reflected increased knowledge of life's diversity



 

 Arranging the diversity of life into the highest taxa is a work in progress



In Chapter 25, we looked at systematics as the study of biological diversity in an evolutionary context. Now that we have gone back in time to the very origin of life on Earth, systematics is once again relevant as we attempt to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the immense diversity of forms that arose from those early organisms.





 Life on Earth originated between 3.5 and 4.0 billion years ago

Life began remarkably early in Earth's history, and those first organisms were ancestral to the great diversity of life we observe today. The organisms most familiar to us are macroscopic and multicellular -- mainly plants and animals. However, for the first three-quarters of evolutionary history, Earth's only organisms were microscopic and mostly unicellular.

The planet Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. However, it is unlikely that life could have survived on Earth for the first few hundred million years, because the planet was bombarded by huge rock bodies left over from the formation of the solar system. The impacts were colossal; one of them may have dislodged a chunk of Earth that became the moon. During this period of bombardment, the pounding generated enough heat to vaporize all the available water and prevent seas from forming. Most geologists now agree that this bombardment phase ended about 3.9 billion years ago.

The oldest known rocks on Earth's surface, located at a site called Isua, in Greenland, are 3.8 billion years old. Although there are some chemical clues in these rocks that life may have existed at the time, no one has yet found fossils of microorganisms in rocks so old. The oldest fossils of organisms that biologists have found so far are embedded in rocks from western Australia that are 3.5 billion years old. These microfossils resemble certain bacteria that still exist today (FIGURE 26.3). For bacteria so complex to have evolved by 3.5 billion years ago, it is a reasonable hypothesis that life originated much earlier, perhaps as early as 3.9 billion years ago, when Earth began to cool to a temperature at which liquid water could exist. We do know that prokaryotic life was already flourishing when Earth was still relatively young.

Fig 26-3. Early and modern prokaryotes. Fossils in rocks older than about 500 million years escaped notice until about 40 years ago, partly because they are microscopic.





 Prokaryotes dominated evolutionary history from 3.5 to 2.0 billion years ago

One might guess from the relatively simple structure of the prokaryotic cell, compared with the eukaryotic cell, that the earliest organisms were prokaryotes. The fossil record supports that presumption. There is a rich fossil history of prokaryotic life, without solid evidence of eukaryotes, spanning 1.5 billion years, from about 3.5 to 2.0 billion years ago. Relatively early in that prokaryotic world, two main evolutionary branches, the bacteria and the archaea, diverged. Diverse species of these two main prokaryotic groups continue to thrive in various environments today.

Many of the oldest fossils of prokaryotes are found in stromatolites, fossilized mats similar to layered microbial mats that certain groups of prokaryotes still form today in salt marshes and warm lagoons (FIGURE 26.4). Researchers have also discovered fossils of prokaryotes in Australian sediments that formed around hydrothermal vents about 3.2 billion years ago. Hydrothermal vents are hot volcanic outlets in the deep-sea floor. Prokaryotes that inhabit such vents today are very different in their metabolism from prokaryotes making up algal mats such as those in FIGURE 26.4b. We'll explore the metabolically diverse prokaryotes in detail in Chapter 27. For now, the important point is that considerable metabolic diversity among prokaryotes living in various environments had already evolved over 3 billion years ago.

Fig 26-4. Bacterial mats and stromatolites.





 Oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere about 2.7 billion years ago

Photosynthesis probably evolved very early in prokaryotic history, but in metabolic versions that did not split water and liberate oxygen (see Chapter 10). We'll see examples of such nonoxygenic photosynthesis among modern prokaryotes in Chapter 27. The only photosynthetic prokaryotes that generate O2 are called cyanobacteria. Plentiful and diverse today, they probably evolved over 2.7 billion years ago.

Most atmospheric oxygen is of biological origin, from the water-splitting step of photosynthesis. When this oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved, the free O2 from the cyanobacteria probably dissolved in the surrounding water until the seas and lakes became saturated with the oxygen. Additional O2 would then react with dissolved iron and precipitate as iron oxide. These marine sediments were the source of banded iron formations, red layers of rock rich in the iron oxide that is a valuable source of iron ore today (FIGURE 26.5). Once all the dissolved iron had precipitated, additional O2 finally began to "gas out" of the seas and lakes to accumulate in the atmosphere. This change left its mark in the rusting of terrestrial rocks rich in iron that began oxidizing about 2.7 billion years ago. This chronology implies that cyanobacteria may have originated as early as 3.5 billion years ago, when the microbial mats that left stromatolites began forming.

Fig 26-5. Banded iron formations are evidence of the vintage of oxygenic photosynthesis. These bands of iron oxide at Jasper Knob in Michigan are about 2 billion years old.

The accumulation of atmospheric O2 was gradual from about 2.7 to 2.2 billion years ago, but then shot up relatively rapidly to more than 10%  of its present level. This oxygen revolution had an enormous impact on life. The "corrosive" O2, which attacks chemical bonds, doomed many prokaryotic groups. Some species survived in habitats that remained anaerobic, where we find their descendants still living today as obligate anaerobes (see p. 533). Among other survivors, a diversity of adaptations to the changing atmosphere evolved, including cellular respiration, which uses oxygen to help harvest energy stored in organic molecules.

The early rise in atmospheric O2 was associated with the photosynthesis of early cyanobacteria. But what caused the accelerated rise in O2 a few hundred million years later? One hypothesis is that it followed the evolution of eukaryotic algae containing chloroplasts.





 Eukaryotic life began by 2.1 billion years ago

Eukaryotic cells are generally larger and much more complex than prokaryotic cells (see Chapter 7). In Chapter 28, we'll examine evidence that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotes living within larger prokaryotic cells. The mitochondria of our cells and those of all other eukaryotes are descendants of some of those "endosymbionts" (symbiotic cells living within larger host cells). And so are the chloroplasts of plants and algae.

The oldest putative fossils of eukaryotes are 2.2-billion-year-old corkscrew-shaped organisms that look like relatively simple single-celled algae. The oldest fossils that are large enough to be eukaryotic to the satisfaction of most researchers are only about 2.1 billion years old. However, some researchers postulate a much earlier eukaryotic origin based on certain chemical traces dating back 2.7 billion years. This range of vintages places the earliest eukaryotes during a time when the oxygen revolution was changing Earth's environments dramatically. Chloroplasts may be part of the explanation for this temporal correlation. And another eukaryotic organelle, the mitochondrion, turned the accumulating O2 to metabolic advantage through the process of cellular respiration.





 Multicellular eukaryotes evolved by 1.2 billion years ago

The origin of the more complex cells set the stage for a diversification of eukaryotic life. A great range of unicellular forms evolved, giving rise to a diversity of protists, and their single-celled descendants, that continue to flourish today. But multicellular forms also evolved. Their descendants include a variety of multicellular algae, plants, fungi, and animals. A multicellular organism, such as an animal, generally develops from a single cell--the fertilized egg, or zygote, in the case of sexual reproduction (see FIGURE 13.4). Cell division and cell differentiation help transform the single cell to a multicellular adult with many types of specialized cells.

Molecular clocks date the common ancestor of multicellular eukaryotes back to 1.5 billion years ago. However, the oldest known fossils of multicellular eukaryotes are of relatively small algae that lived about 1.2 billion years ago (FIGURE 26.6). Larger organisms, including animals such as jellies ("jellyfishes") and worms, do not appear in the fossil record until several hundred million years later, in the late Precambrian era about 600 million years ago (see FIGURE 26.1). Chinese paleontologists recently described a particularly rich fossil site 570 million years old containing a diversity of algae and animals, including some beautifully preserved embryos (FIGURE 26.7).

Geologists have recently reported evidence of a severe ice age enduring from 750 to 570 million years ago that may help to explain why multicellular eukaryotes were relatively limited in diversity and distribution until the very late Precambrian. This snowball Earth hypothesis is based partly on geologic clues that glaciers covered the planet's landmasses from pole to pole. The seas also would have been iced over. Thus, most life would have been confined to areas near deep-sea vents and hot springs or to those sparse locales where enough ice melted for sunlight to penetrate the surface waters of the seas. According to this hypothesis, the fossil record for the first major diversification of multicellular eukaryotes corresponds in time to the thawing of snowball Earth. A second radiation of eukaryotic forms produced most of the major groups of animals during the early Cambrian period, the first period of the Paleozoic era.





 Animal diversity exploded during the early Cambrian period

Although the history of animal life dates back to the late Precambrian era, a much greater diversity of animals evolved just after the dawn of the Paleozoic era 543 million years ago. Cnidarians (the phylum that includes jellies) and poriferans (sponges) were already present in the late Precambrian. However, most of the major groups (phyla) of animals make their first fossil appearances during the relatively short span of the Cambrian period's first 20 million years (FIGURE 26.8). In Chapter 32, we'll evaluate a few hypothetical explanations for the so-called Cambrian explosion.

 Plants, fungi, and animals colonized the land about 500 million years ago

The colonization of land was one of the pivotal milestones in the history of life. There is fossil evidence that cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic prokaryotes coated damp terrestrial surfaces well over a billion years ago. However, macroscopic life in the form of plants, fungi, and animals did not colonize land until about 500 million years ago, during the early Paleozoic era. This gradual evolutionary venture out of ancestral aquatic environments was associated with adaptations that helped prevent dehydration and that made it possible to reproduce on land. For example, plants, which evolved from green algae, have a waterproof coating of wax on their leaves that slows the loss of water.

Plants colonized land in the company of fungi. Even today, the roots of most plants are associated with fungi that aid in the absorption of water and minerals from the soil. The fungi, in turn, obtain their organic nutrients from the plant. Such symbiotic associations of plants and fungi are evident in some of the oldest fossilized roots, dating this relationship back to the early spread of life onto land. You will learn more about the evolution of plants and fungi in Chapters 29-31.

Plants transformed the landscape, creating new opportunities for all life, including herbivorous (plant-eating) animals and their predators. Although many animal groups are represented in terrestrial environments, the most widespread and diverse land animals are certain arthropods (in the form of insects and spiders) and certain vertebrates (in the form of amphibians such as frogs and salamanders, reptiles such as lizards and snakes, birds, and mammals). The terrestrial vertebrates are called tetrapods, a reference to the four walking limbs that distinguish them from the various aquatic vertebrates we call fishes. An excellent fossil record documents the descent of amphibians from fishes. Reptiles evolved from amphibians, and both birds and mammals evolved from reptiles. Most of the groups (orders) of modern mammals were established by about 50-60 million years ago, including the primates, the order that includes apes and humans. The human lineage diverged from other primates only about 5 million years ago--the most recent second in a clock of life's history rescaled to represent an hour. But our history, like that of every other species in the rich diversity of life, actually begins with the first organisms to live on the primordial Earth over 3.5 billion years ago.





 The first cells may have originated by chemical evolution on a young Earth:an overview

Most biologists favor the hypothesis that life on Earth developed from nonliving materials that became ordered into molecular aggregates that were eventually capable of self-replication and metabolism.

Resolving the Biogenesis Paradox

From the time of the ancient Greeks until well into the 19th century, it was common "knowledge" that life could arise from nonliving matter. This idea of life emerging from inanimate material is called spontaneous generation. Experiments with flies and other organisms in the late Renaissance period convinced scientists to reject the notion of spontaneous generation for macroscopic life. However, the idea persisted well into the 19th century as an explanation for the rapid growth of microorganisms in spoiled foods. Then, in 1862, Louis Pasteur's famous experiments with broth completed the overturn of spontaneous generation, even for microorganisms (FIGURE 26.9). As far as we know, all life today arises only by the reproduction of preexisting life. This "life-from-life" principle is called biogenesis.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 26-9. Pasteur and biogenesis of microorganisms. In the early 1860s, Louis Pasteur (inset) conducted a series of experiments to test whether microorganisms emerge by spontaneous generation or by reproduction of existing microorganisms (biogenesis). His research contributed to the germ theory of disease, which connected infections to the spread of microorganisms and led to improvements in hospital hygiene and public sanitation. The legacy of these famous experiments is also manifest in the term pasteurization. Pasteurized milk, for example, has been heated to destroy potentially harmful microorganisms and then sealed to maintain the sterility.

But what about the first organisms? If they arose by biogenesis, then they couldn't have been the first organisms. Although there is no evidence that spontaneous generation occurs today, conditions on the early Earth were very different. For instance, there was relatively little atmospheric oxygen to tear apart complex molecules. And such energy sources as lightning, volcanic activity, and ultraviolet sunlight were all more intense than what we experience today. The resolution to the biogenesis paradox is that life did not begin on a planet anything like the modern Earth, but on a young Earth that was a very different world.

A Four-Stage Hypothesis for the Origin of Life

Most biologists now think that it is at least a credible hypothesis that chemical and physical processes in Earth's primordial environment eventually produced very simple cells through a sequence of stages. There is much debate about the nature of those stages.

According to one hypothetical scenario, the first organisms were products of chemical evolution in four stages: (1) the abiotic (nonliving) synthesis of small organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides; (2) the joining of these small molecules (monomers) into polymers, including proteins and nucleic acids; (3) the origin of self-replicating molecules that eventually made inheritance possible; and (4) the packaging of all these molecules into "protobionts," droplets with membranes that maintained an internal chemistry different from the surroundings. This is all speculative, of course, but what makes it science is that the hypothesis leads to predictions that can be tested in the laboratory. Let's take a closer look at some of the evidence for each of these four stages.





 Abiotic synthesis of organic monomers is a testable hypothesis

In the 1920s, A. I. Oparin, of Russia, and J. B. S. Haldane, of Great Britain, independently postulated that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors present in the early atmosphere and seas. This cannot happen in the modern world, Oparin and Haldane reasoned, because the present atmosphere is rich in oxygen produced by photosynthetic life. The oxidizing atmosphere of today is not conducive to the spontaneous synthesis of complex molecules because the oxygen attacks chemical bonds, extracting electrons. Before oxygen-producing photosynthesis, Earth had a much less oxidizing atmosphere, derived mainly from volcanic vapors. Such a reducing (electron-adding) atmosphere would have enhanced the joining of simple molecules to form more complex ones. Even with a reducing atmosphere, making organic molecules would require considerable energy, which was probably provided by lightning and the intense UV radiation that penetrated the primitive atmosphere. The modern atmosphere has a layer of ozone produced from oxygen, and this ozone shield screens out most UV radiation. There is also evidence that young suns emit more UV radiation than older suns. Oparin and Haldane envisioned an ancient world with the chemical conditions and energy resources needed for the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules.

In 1953, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey tested the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis by creating, in the laboratory, conditions comparable to those that scientists had postulated for the early Earth. Their apparatus produced a variety of amino acids and other organic compounds found in living organisms today (FIGURE 26.10; also see FIGURE 4.1).

Fig 26-10. The Miller-Urey experiment. A warmed flask of water simulated the primeval sea. The "atmosphere" consisted of H2O, H2, CH4, and NH3. Sparks were discharged in the synthetic atmosphere to mimic lightning. A condenser cooled the atmosphere, raining water and any dissolved compounds back to the miniature sea. As material circulated through the apparatus, the solution in the flask changed from clear to murky brown. After one week, Miller and Urey analyzed the contents of the solution and found a variety of organic compounds, including some of the amino acids that make up the proteins of organisms.

The atmosphere in the Miller-Urey model was made up of H2O, H2, CH4 (methane), and NH3 (ammonia), the gases that researchers in the 1950s believed prevailed in the ancient world. This atmosphere was probably more strongly reducing than the actual atmosphere of early Earth. Modern volcanoes emit CO, CO2, N2, and water vapor, and it is likely that these gases were abundant in the ancient atmosphere. Hydrogen gas was probably not a major component, and traces of O2 may even have been present, formed from reactions among other gases as they baked under the powerful UV radiation. Many laboratories have repeated the Miller experiment using a variety of recipes for the atmosphere. Abiotic synthesis of organic compounds occurred in these modified models, although yields were generally smaller than in the original experiment.

The Miller-Urey experiments still stimulate debate on the origin of Earth's early stockpile of organic ingredients. Today, one line of research focuses on where chemicals needed for organic syntheses came from and where the reactions most likely occurred. Some scientists now doubt that the early atmosphere played a significant role in early chemical reactions. Instead, submerged volcanoes and deep-sea vents--gaps in Earth's crust where hot water and minerals gush into deep oceans--may have provided the essential resources. Evidence is also building that life could have begun in a much simpler chemical environment than formerly thought. For instance, the first cells may have used inorganic sulfur and iron compounds as energy sources to make their own ATP instead of taking it up from their surroundings.

It is also plausible that some organic compounds reached Earth from space. In 2000, Indian scientists reported computer models showing how molecules such as adenine, an ingredient of DNA, could form by reactions of cyanide in the clouds of gas between stars. These simulations would explain why some meteorites that have crashed to Earth contain organic molecules. But whether the primordial Earth was stocked with organic monomers made here or elsewhere, the key point is that the molecular ingredients of life were probably present very early.





 Laboratory simulations of early-Earth conditions have produced organic polymers

The hypothesis of an abiotic origin of life makes another prediction that can be tested in the laboratory. If the hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to link organic monomers to form polymers such as proteins and nucleic acids without the help of enzymes and other cellular equipment. Researchers have observed such polymerization after dripping solutions of organic monomers onto hot sand, clay, or rock. The heat vaporizes the water in the solutions and concentrates the monomers on the underlying substance. Some of the monomers then spontaneously bond together to form polymers, including polypeptides, the chains of amino acids that make up proteins. On the early Earth, raindrops or waves may have splashed dilute solutions of organic monomers onto fresh lava or other hot rocks and then rinsed polypeptides and other polymers back into the sea. Alternatively, deep-sea vents, where gases and superheated water with dissolved minerals escape from Earth's interior, may have been locales for the abiotic synthesis of both organic monomers and polymers.





 RNA may have been the first genetic material

Life is defined partly by the process of inheritance, which is based on self-replicating molecules. Today's cells store their genetic information as DNA. They transcribe the information into RNA and then translate RNA messages into specific enzymes and other proteins (see Chapter 17). This mechanism of information flow probably emerged gradually through a series of refinements to much simpler processes. In fact, many researchers now favor the hypothesis that the first hereditary material was not DNA, but RNA, which may also have functioned as the first enzymes. (This helps resolve the "chicken and egg" paradox of which came first, genes or enzymes.) According to this hypothesis, the molecular biology of today was preceded by an "RNA world."

Molecular Replication in an RNA World

Several scientists have tested the hypothesis of RNA self-replication. Short polymers of ribonucleotides have been produced abiotically in laboratory experiments. If such RNA is added to a solution containing monomers for making more RNA, sequences about five to ten nucleotides long are copied from the template according to the base-pairing rules (FIGURE 26.11). If zinc is added as a catalyst, sequences up to 40 nucleotides long are copied with less than 1%  error.

Fig 26-11. Abiotic replication of RNA.

In the 1980s, Thomas Cech revolutionized thinking about the evolution of life when he discovered that RNA molecules are important catalysts in modern cells. This finding disproved the long-held view that only proteins (enzymes) serve as biological catalysts. Cech and other researchers found that modern cells use RNA catalysts, called ribozymes, to remove introns from RNA (see Chapter 17). Ribozymes also help catalyze the synthesis of new RNA, notably rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. Thus, RNA is autocatalytic, and in the prebiotic world, before there were enzymes (proteins) or DNA, RNA molecules may have been fully capable of ribozyme-catalyzed replication.

Natural Selection in an RNA World

Natural selection on the molecular level has been observed operating on RNA populations in the laboratory. Unlike double-stranded DNA, which takes the form of a uniform helix, single-stranded RNA molecules assume a variety of specific three-dimensional shapes mandated by their nucleotide sequences. The molecule thus has both a genotype (its nucleotide sequence) and a phenotype (its conformation, which interacts with surrounding molecules in specific ways). In a particular environment, RNA molecules of certain base sequences are more stable and replicate faster and with fewer errors than other sequences. Beginning with a diversity of RNA molecules that must compete for monomers to replicate, the sequence best suited to the temperature, salt concentration, and other features of the surrounding solution and having the greatest autocatalytic activity will prevail. Its descendants will not be a single RNA species but will be a family of closely related sequences because of copying errors. Selection screens mutations in the original sequence, and occasionally a copying error results in a molecule that folds into a shape that is even more stable or more adept at self-replication than the ancestral sequence. Similar selection events may have occurred in the prebiotic RNA world.

The rudiments of RNA-directed protein synthesis may have been the weak binding of specific amino acids to bases along RNA molecules, which functioned as simple templates holding a few amino acids together long enough for them to be linked. (Indeed, this is one function of rRNA in modern ribosomes.) If RNA happened to synthesize a short polypeptide that in turn behaved as an enzyme helping the RNA molecule to replicate, then the early chemical dynamics included molecular cooperation as well as competition. These first steps toward the replication and translation of genetic information may have been taken by molecular evolution even before RNA and polypeptides became packaged within membranes.





 Protobionts can form by self-assembly

The properties of life emerge from an interaction of molecules organized into higher levels of order. Living cells may have been preceded by protobionts, aggregates of abiotically produced molecules. Protobionts are not capable of precise reproduction, but they maintain an internal chemical environment different from their surroundings and exhibit some of the properties associated with life, including metabolism and excitability.

Laboratory experiments demonstrate that protobionts could have formed spontaneously from abiotically produced organic compounds. For example, droplets called liposomes form when the organic ingredients include certain lipids. These lipids organize into a molecular bilayer at the surface of the droplet, much like the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. Because the membrane is selectively permeable, the liposomes undergo osmotic swelling or shrinking when placed in solutions of different salt concentrations. Some of these protobionts also store energy in the form of a membrane potential, a voltage across the surface. The protobionts can discharge the voltage in nervelike fashion; such excitability is characteristic of all life (which is not to say that liposomes are alive, but only that they display some of the properties of life). Liposomes behave dynamically, sometimes growing by engulfing smaller liposomes and then splitting, other times "giving birth" to smaller liposomes (FIGURE 26.12a). If enzymes are included among the ingredients, they are incorporated into the droplets. The protobionts are then able to absorb substrates from their surroundings and release the products of the reactions catalyzed by the enzymes (FIGURE 26.12b).

Fig 26-12. Laboratory versions of protobionts.

Unlike some laboratory models, protobionts that formed in the ancient seas would not have possessed refined enzymes, which are made in cells according to inherited instructions. Some molecules produced abiotically, however, do have weak catalytic capacities, and there could well have been protobionts that had a rudimentary metabolism that allowed them to modify substances they took in across their membranes.





 Natural selection could refine protobionts containing hereditary information

The packaging of primitive RNA genes and their polypeptide products within a membrane would have been a significant milestone in the early history of life. Once this occurred, protobionts could have evolved as units, and molecular cooperation could be refined because components that interacted in ways favorable to the success of the protobiont as a whole were concentrated together in a microscopic volume rather than being spread throughout the surroundings (FIGURE 26.13). Suppose, for example, that an RNA molecule ordered amino acids into a primitive enzyme that extracted energy from inorganic sulfur compounds taken up from the surroundings. This energy could be used for other reactions within the protobiont, including replication of RNA. Natural selection could favor such a gene only if its product were kept close by, rather than being shared with competing RNA sequences in its environment. The most successful protobionts would grow and split, distributing copies of their genes to offspring. Even if only one such protobiont arose initially by the abiotic processes that have been described, its descendants would vary because of mutations, errors in the copying of RNA.

Evolution in the true Darwinian sense--differential reproductive success of varied individuals--presumably accumulated many refinements to primitive metabolism and inheritance. One trend apparently led to DNA becoming the hereditary material. Initially, RNA could have provided the template on which DNA nucleotides were assembled. But DNA is a much more stable repository for genetic information than RNA, and once DNA appeared, RNA molecules would have begun to take on their modern roles as intermediates in the translation of genetic programs. The "RNA world" gave way to a "DNA world."





 Debate about the origin of life abounds

Laboratory simulations cannot prove that the kind of chemical evolution that has been described here actually created life on the primitive Earth, but only that some of the key steps could have happened. The origin of life remains a matter of speculation, and there are alternative views of how several key processes occurred.

Some researchers question whether abiotic synthesis of organic monomers on Earth was necessary as a first step in the origin of life. As we discussed earlier, it is possible that at least some organic compounds reached the early Earth from space on meteorites and comets.

Where life began is another issue. Until recently, most researchers favored shallow water or moist sediments as the most likely sites for life's origin. Some scientists now question this view, arguing that Earth's surface was very inhospitable during the period when life probably began. Perhaps life began on the less exposed seafloor. The discovery of deep-sea vents in the late 1970s raised the possibility that earlier vents supplied the energy and chemical precursors for the origin of protobionts (FIGURE 26.14). Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that the ancestors of modern prokaryotes thrived in very hot conditions and may have lived on inorganic sulfur compounds that are common in deep-sea vent environments. Laboratory studies by G&uuml;nter Wachtershuser and colleagues also point to the environments of deep-sea vents and volcanoes as abiotic sources of some of the organic compounds, such as acetyl coenzyme A, that cells use in energy metabolism (see FIGURE 9.11). Sulfides of iron and nickel, common in volcanic and deep-sea vent areas, catalyze the formation of acetic acid and precursors of acetyl coenzyme from CO and H2S. Wachtershuser considers it likely that life arose in an environment where these reactions were common and then adopted them as the earliest form of metabolism.

Fig 26-14. A window to early life? In this porthole view from the deep-sea research submarine Alvin, you can see a water-testing wand mounted to a robotic arm. This 2000 expedition to the Sea of Cort&eacute;s sampled the environments around deep-sea hydrothermal vents at depths of greater than a mile. The column of hot effluent seen rising from this vent included hydrogen sulfide and iron sulfide, which react to produce pyrite (fool's gold) and H2 gas. Prokaryotes that live around the vents use the H2 as an energy source. Although we may consider such environments extreme by modern-Earth criteria, many researchers favor the hypothesis that life began in such places.

On a broader scale, the hypothesis that life is not restricted to Earth is becoming more accessible to scientific testing. Photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft of the ice-covered surface of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, have led to hypotheses that liquid water lies beneath the surface and may support prokaryotic life. The surface of Mars is a cold, dry, lifeless desert, but billions of years ago it was probably relatively warm and may have held liquid water and had a CO2-rich atmosphere. It is possible that prebiotic chemistry, similar to that on early Earth, also occurred on Mars before the planet became less hospitable. Scientists anticipate that exploration in the next decade will provide clues about whether microbial life on Mars once existed. Did life evolve there and then die out, or was prebiotic chemistry snuffed out by planetary changes before any life forms developed? Many scientists also see Mars as an ideal place to test hypotheses about Earth's prebiotic chemistry.

Debate about the origin of terrestrial and extraterrestrial life abounds, and we have sampled only a few of the issues. Whatever took place in the prebiotic world, the leap from an aggregate of molecules that reproduces to even the simplest prokaryotic cell is immense, and change must have occurred in many smaller evolutionary steps. The point at which we stop calling membrane-enclosed compartments that metabolize and replicate their genetic programs protobionts and begin calling them living cells is as fuzzy as our definitions of life. We do know that prokaryotes were already flourishing at least 3.5 billion years ago and that all the lineages of life arose from those ancient prokaryotes.





 The five-kingdom system reflected increased knowledge of life's diversity

Systematists have traditionally considered the kingdom to be the highest--the most inclusive--taxonomic category. Many of us grew up with the notion that there are only two kingdoms of life--plants and animals--because we live in a macroscopic, terrestrial realm where we rarely see organisms that do not fit neatly into a plant-animal dichotomy. The two-kingdom scheme also had a long tradition in formal taxonomy; Linnaeus divided all known forms of life between the plant and animal kingdoms.

Even with the discovery of the diverse microbial world, the two-kingdom system persisted. Bacteria were placed in the plant kingdom, their rigid cell walls cited as justification. Eukaryotic unicellular organisms with chloroplasts were also considered plants. Fungi, too, fell under the plant banner, partly because they are sedentary, even though no fungi are photosynthetic and they have little in common structurally with green plants. In the two-kingdom system, unicellular creatures that move and ingest food--protozoa--were called animals. Microbes such as Euglena that move but are photosynthetic were claimed by both botanists and zoologists and showed up in the taxonomies of plant and animal kingdoms alike. Schemes with additional kingdoms were proposed, but none became popular with the majority of biologists until Robert H. Whittaker, of Cornell University, argued effectively for a five-kingdom system in 1969. Whittaker designated these five kingdoms as Monera, Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia (FIGURE 26.15).

Fig 26-15. Whittaker's five-kingdom system.

The five-kingdom system recognized the two fundamentally different types of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, and set the prokaryotes apart from all eukaryotes by placing them in their own kingdom, Monera.

Whittaker distinguished three kingdoms of multicellular eukaryotes--Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia--partly on the criterion of nutrition. Plants are autotrophic in nutritional mode, making their food by photosynthesis. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms that are absorptive in nutritional mode. Most fungi are decomposers that live embedded in their food source, secreting digestive enzymes and absorbing the small organic molecules that are the products of digestion. Most animals live by ingesting food and digesting it within specialized cavities.

We are left with the kingdom Protista. In Whittaker's five-kingdom system, Protista consisted of all eukaryotes that did not fit the definition of plants, fungi, or animals. Most protists are unicellular forms. However, the boundaries of Whittaker's kingdom Protista were expanded to include some multicellular organisms, such as seaweeds, because of their relationships to certain unicellular protists. With such refinements, the five-kingdom system prevailed in biology for over 20 years.





 Arranging the diversity of life into the highest taxa is a work in progress

Like any classification scheme, the five-kingdom system is not a natural fact but a human construct. It is one attempt to order the diversity of life into a scheme that is useful and, hopefully, phylogenetically reasonable. During the past three decades, systematists applying cladistic analysis, including the construction of cladograms based on molecular data (see Chapter 25), have been pointing out problems with the traditional five-kingdom scheme.

One challenge to the five-kingdom system is the evidence that there are two distinct lineages of prokaryotes. These new data led to a three-domain system (FIGURE 26.16a and b). The three domains, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, are essentially superkingdoms, a taxonomic level even higher than the kingdom level. Note that the three-domain system makes the kingdom Monera obsolete, since it would have members in two different domains. In fact, many microbiologists now divide each of the two prokaryotic domains into multiple kingdoms based on cladistic analysis of molecular data (see FIGURE 26.16c).

Fig 26-16. Our changing view of biological diversity.

The second major challenge to the five-kingdom system is being mounted by systematists who are sorting out the phylogeny of the diverse eukaryotes formerly collected in the kingdom Protista. Molecular systematics and cladistics have revealed that Protista is not a monophyletic grouping (see Chapter 25 to review cladistics). The specialists who study these organisms now split most of them into five or more newly designated kingdoms, but have also assigned certain groups that used to be included in Protista to Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia (see FIGURE 26.16c).

Clearly, taxonomy at the highest levels is a work in progress. It may seem ironic that systematists are generally more confident in their groupings of species into lower taxa such as genera and families than they are about the evolutionary relationships among the major groups of organisms. But this makes sense when you consider our own family genealogies. It's easier to sort out our relationships to siblings and cousins than it is to identify more distant relatives, such as third or fourth cousins, by tracing our genealogies back to ancestors who lived long ago. Similarly, tracing phylogeny at the kingdom level takes us back to the evolutionary branching that occurred in Precambrian seas a billion or more years ago.

There will be much more research before there is anything close to a new consensus for how the three domains of life are related and how many kingdoms in each domain of life are required to have a classification that reflects evolutionary history. And even then, new data will undoubtedly lead to further taxonomic remodeling. As we survey the diversity of life in the chapters that follow, keep in mind that phylogenetic trees and taxonomic groupings are hypotheses that fit the best available data. It is this continuing scrutiny of testable hypotheses that validates evolutionary biology as a natural science.

The history of prokaryotic life is a success story spanning more than 3.5 billion years. Prokaryotes were the earliest organisms, and they lived and evolved all alone on Earth for 1.5 billion years. They have continued to adapt and flourish on an evolving Earth, and in turn they have helped to change the Earth. In this chapter, you will become more familiar with prokaryotes by studying their structure and function, their origins and evolution, their diversity, and their ecological significance.

Most prokaryotes are unicellular. However, some species tend to aggregate transiently in groups of two or more cells. Others have the form of true colonies, which are permanent aggregates of identical cells. And in some species of prokaryotes, there is even a division of labor between two or more specialized types of cells.

There is a diversity of cell shapes among prokaryotes, the three most common being spheres (cocci), rods (bacilli), and helices (including the bacteria known as spirilla and spirochetes). An important step in identifying prokaryotes is determining their shape by microscopic examination (FIGURE 27.3).

Fig 27-3. The most common shapes of prokaryotes. (a) Cocci (singular, coccus), or spherical prokaryotes, occur singly, in pairs (diplo cocci), in chains of many cells (streptococci, shown here), and in clusters resembling bunches of grapes (staphylococci). (b) Rod-shaped prokaryotes, or bacilli (singular, bacillus), are usually solitary, but in some forms the rods are arranged in chains. (c) Helical prokaryotes include the spirilla and the corkscrew-shaped spirochetes. (All colorized SEMs.)

Most prokaryotes have diameters in the range of 1-5 &uuml;m, compared to 10-100 &uuml;m for the majority of eukaryotic cells. There are, however notable exceptions; the largest prokaryote discovered so far measures about 0.75 mm in diameter, dwarfing most eukaryotic cells (FIGURE 27.4).

The two smaller cells above the bright one are dead. Researchers who discovered the giant prokaryote in 1997 named it Thiomargarita namibiensis, which means "sulfur pearl of Namibia." It uses sulfur compounds in its metabolism and inhabits coastal sediments in the African country of Namibia.

Metabolic diversity is greater among prokaryotes than among all eukaryotes combined. Every type of nutrition observed in eukaryotes is represented among prokaryotes, along with some nutritional modes unique to prokaryotes.

In this section, we'll take a closer look at the distinction between archaea and bacteria and then examine a few of the major groups within these two domains of prokaryotic organisms.





THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OF PROKARYOTES

 

 Prokaryotes are indispensable links in the recycling of chemical elements in ecosystems



 

 Many prokaryotes are symbiotic



 

 Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases



 

 Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology



One of the themes of this unit is changing life on a changing planet--the relationship between geologic history and evolving biological forms. Organisms as pervasive, abundant, and diverse as the prokaryotes have had a tremendous impact on Earth and all its inhabitants.





 They're (almost) everywhere! An overview of prokaryotic life

Today, prokaryotes still dominate the biosphere. Their collective biological mass (biomass) outweighs all eukaryotes combined by at least tenfold. More prokaryotes inhabit a handful of fertile soil or the mouth or skin of a human than the total number of people who have ever lived. In the colorized scanning electron micrograph on this page, the tiny orange rods are bacteria on the point of a pin. (You can see from this micrograph why a pin prick can cause an infection, and why it's important to flame the tip of a needle to kill bacteria before using the needle to remove a splinter.)

Prokaryotes are found wherever there is life. They also thrive in habitats too cold, too hot, too salty, too acidic, or too alkaline for any eukaryote (FIGURE 27.1). In 1999, biologists even discovered prokaryotes growing on the walls of a gold mine 2 miles below Earth's surface.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-1. "Heat-loving" prokaryotes. The vivid reds, oranges, and yellows that paint these rocks are colonies of prokaryotes that thrive in the extremely hot water (up to 104&#176;C) that flows from this Nevada geyser. Ranchers accidentally tapped the geyser when they were drilling for water in 1916.

Though individual prokaryotes are relatively small organisms, they are giants in their collective impact on Earth and its life. We hear most about a minority of species that cause serious illness. During the 14th century, Black Death--bubonic plague, a bacterial disease--spread across Europe, killing an estimated 25%  of the human population. Tuberculosis, cholera, many sexually transmissible diseases, and certain types of food poisoning are other human diseases caused by bacteria.

However, prokaryotic life is no rogues' gallery. Far more common than harmful bacteria are those that are benign or beneficial. Bacteria in our intestines provide us with important vitamins, and others living in our mouth prevent harmful fungi from growing there. Prokaryotes also cycle carbon and other vital chemical elements back and forth between organic matter and the soil and atmosphere. For example, there are prokaryotes that decompose dead organisms. Found in soil and at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and oceans, these decomposers return chemical elements to the environment in the form of inorganic compounds that can be used by plants, which in turn feed animals. If prokaryotic decomposers were to disappear, the chemical cycles that sustain life would break down. All forms of eukaryotic life would also be doomed. In contrast, prokaryotic life would undoubtedly persist in the absence of eukaryotes, as it once did for 1.5 billion years.

Prokaryotes often live in close associations with other prokaryotes and with eukaryotes in what are called symbiotic relationships. In the most historically important case of such symbiosis, mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes that became residents within larger host cells. Thus, animals, plants, fungi, and protists evolved from symbiotic associations of ancestral cells. (We will examine this theory of eukaryotic origins further in Chapter 28.)

Modern prokaryotes are diverse in structure and metabolism. About 5,000 species of prokaryotes are known, and estimates of actual prokaryotic diversity range from about 400,000 to 4 million species. As Harvard University biologist E.O. Wilson puts it, a true sense of biodiversity requires a "downward adjustment of scale."





 Bacteria and archaea are the two main branches of prokaryote evolution

In the traditional five-kingdom system of classification, prokaryotes make up the kingdom Monera, and the four eukaryotic kingdoms are Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia (see FIGURE 26.15). This scheme emphasizes the structural differences between the cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In the past two decades, however, systematists have determined that a single kingdom incorporating all prokaryotes is not consistent with evolutionary history. By comparing ribosomal RNA and the completely sequenced genomes of several extant (living today) species, researchers have identified two major branches of prokaryote evolution. The names for these two groups are bacteria and archaea. The term archaea refers to the antiquity of the group's origin from the earliest cells (from the Greek archaio, ancient). Many species of archaea inhabit extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt ponds. Few, if any, other modern organisms can survive in these environments, which may resemble habitats on the early Earth. Archaea differ from bacteria in many key structural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics, differences that will be highlighted later in this chapter.

When researchers led by Carl Woese, of the University of Illinois, first recognized the distinction between bacteria and archaea, they proposed a six-kingdom system: two prokaryotic kingdoms along with the four eukaryotic kingdoms. Because bacteria and archaea diverged so early in the history of life and are so fundamentally different, Woese and many other systematists now favor organizing the diversity of life into three domains, a taxonomic level above kingdom (FIGURE 27.2). In this view, prokaryotes account for two of the domains: domain Bacteria and domain Archaea.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-2. The three domains of life. This phylogenetic tree represents the hypothesis that the two major prokaryotic groups diverged very early and that Archaea is more closely related to Eukarya than to Bacteria. In Chapter 28, we'll see how new data are stimulating some remodeling of this hypothesis.

Taxonomic issues aside, bacteria and archaea are both structurally organized at the prokaryotic level, which is the rationale for combining them in this chapter. The distinction between bacteria and archaea will become more apparent after we examine some of the structural, genetic, and metabolic adaptations that contribute to the pervasiveness of prokaryotes on Earth.





 Nearly all prokaryotes have a cell wall external to the plasma membrane

Present in nearly all prokaryotes, the cell wall maintains the shape of the cell, affords physical protection, and prevents the cell from bursting in a hypotonic environment (see Chapter 8). Like other walled cells, however, prokaryotes plasmolyze (shrink away from their wall) and may die in a hypertonic medium, which is why heavily salted meat can be kept so long without being spoiled by prokaryotes. The cell walls of prokaryotes differ in molecular composition and construction from those of plants, fungi, and protists.

The presence of a cell wall is one reason prokaryotes were grouped with plants in the old two-kingdom system. Instead of cellulose, the staple of plant walls, most bacterial walls contain a unique material called peptidoglycan, which consists of polymers of modified sugars cross-linked by short polypeptides that vary from species to species (the walls of archaea lack peptidoglycan). The effect is a single molecular network enclosing and protecting the entire cell. External to this fabric are other substances that also differ from species to species.

One of the most valuable tools for identifying specific bacteria is the Gram stain, which can be used to separate many species into two groups based on differences in their cell walls. Gram-positive bacteria have simpler walls, with a relatively large amount of peptidoglycan. The walls of gram-negative bacteria have less peptidoglycan and are structurally more complex. An outer membrane on the gram-negative cell wall contains lipopolysaccharides, carbohydrates bonded to lipids (FIGURE 27.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-5. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Gram-staining, named for Hans Christian Gram, a Danish physician who developed the technique in the late 1800s, dis tinguishes between two different kinds of bacterial cell walls. Bacteria are stained with a violet dye and iodine, rinsed in alcohol, and then stained again with a red dye. The structure of the cell wall determines the staining response. (The colors in the diagrams do not represent the stains.)

Among pathogenic, or disease-causing, bacteria, gram-negative species are generally more threatening than gram-positive species. The lipopolysaccharides on the walls of gram-negative bacteria are often toxic, and the outer membrane helps protect the pathogens against the defenses of their hosts. Furthermore, gram-negative bacteria are commonly more resistant than gram-positive species to antibiotics because the outer membrane impedes entry of the drugs.

Many antibiotics, including penicillins, inhibit the synthesis of cross-links in peptidoglycan and prevent the formation of a functional wall, particularly in gram-positive species. These drugs are like selective bullets that cripple many species of infectious bacteria without adversely affecting humans and other eukaryotes, which do not make peptidoglycan.

Many prokaryotes secrete sticky substances that form still another protective layer called a capsule outside the cell wall. Capsules enable the organisms to adhere to their substratum and provide additional protection, including increased resistance of pathogenic prokaryotes to host defenses. Gelatinous capsules glue together the cells of many prokaryotes that live as colonies.

Another way some prokaryotes adhere to one another or to some substratum is by means of surface appendages called pili (singular, pilus; FIGURE 27.6, p. 530). For example, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhea, uses pili to fasten itself to mucous membranes of its host. Some pili are specialized for holding prokaryotes together long enough for the cells to transfer DNA during conjugation (see Chapter 18).

Fig 27-6. Pili. These appendages enable some prokaryotes to attach to surfaces or to other prokaryotes (colorized TEM). Some pili function during conjugation, holding partners together while DNA is transferred (see FIGURE 18.14).





 Many prokaryotes are motile

About half of all prokaryotes are capable of directional movement. Some species exceed speeds of 50 &uuml;m/sec, or about 100 times their body length per second.

Flagellar action is the most common mechanism of movement among prokaryotes. Flagella may be scattered over the entire cell surface or concentrated at one or both ends of the cell. The flagella of prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ in both structure and function. (To review eukaryotic flagella, see Chapter 7.) Prokaryotic flagella are one-tenth the width of eukaryotic flagella and are not covered by an extension of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 27.7).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-7. Form and function of prokaryotic flagella. Chains of a globular protein, flagellin, are wound in a tight spiral to form a semirigid, helical filament. The filament is attached to another protein that forms a curved hook, which is inserted into a basal apparatus. Composed of about 35 different proteins, the basal apparatus includes a system of rings in the layers of the cell wall (TEM). (The structures shown in this figure are characteristic of gram-negative bacteria.) The basal apparatus--the flagellar motor--rotates the filament, which propels the cell. The motor is powered by the diffusion of protons (H+) into the cell after they have been pumped outward by ATP-powered proton pumps embedded in the plasma membrane.

A second motility mechanism characterizes a group of helix-shaped bacteria called spirochetes. Two or more helical filaments just under the outer sheath of the cell wall are much like prokaryotic flagella in structure. Each has a basal motor attached at one end of the cell. When the filaments rotate, the flexible cell moves like a corkscrew.

In a third mechanism of motility, some prokaryotes that form filamentous chains of cells secrete slimy threads that anchor to the substratum. As the cells continue to secrete jets of slime, the filamentous prokaryote glides along at the growing end of the threads.

In a relatively uniform environment, flagellated prokaryotes may wander randomly. In a heterogeneous environment, however, many prokaryotes are capable of taxis, movement toward or away from a stimulus (from the Greek taxis, to arrange). With chemotaxis, for example, prokaryotes respond to chemical stimuli, perhaps moving toward food or oxygen (a positive chemotaxis) or away from some toxic substance (a negative chemotaxis). Several kinds of receptor molecules that detect specific substances are located on the surfaces of chemotactic prokaryotes. Motile prokaryotes that are photosynthetic generally display a positive phototaxis, a behavior that keeps them in the light. Some prokaryotes even contain a row of tiny magnetic particles that allow the cells to orient in Earth's magnetic field. These particles may help cells distinguish up from down and cause the prokaryotes to migrate toward the nutrient-rich sediments at the bottoms of ponds and shallow seas.





 The cellular and genomic organization of prokaryotes is fundamentally different from that of eukaryotes

Recall that prokaryotes are named for their lack of true nuclei enclosed by membranes (see FIGURE 7.4). The cells of prokaryotes lack the extensive compartmentalization by internal membranes characteristic of eukaryotes. However, various prokaryotes do have a variety of specialized membranes that perform many of their metabolic functions. These membranes are usually infolded regions of the plasma membrane (FIGURE 27.8).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-8. Specialized membranes of prokaryotes. (a) These infoldings of the plasma membrane, reminiscent of the cristae of mitochondria, function in cellular respiration of some aerobic pro karyotes (TEM). (b) Photosynthetic prokaryotes called cyanobacteria have thylakoid membranes, much like those in chloroplasts (TEM).

Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes also have smaller, simpler genomes. On average, prokaryotes have only about one-thousandth as much DNA as a eukaryotic cell. In most prokaryotes, the DNA is concentrated as a snarl of fibers in a nucleoid region that stains less densely than the surrounding cytoplasm in electron micrographs. The mass of fibers is actually the prokaryotic chromosome, one double-stranded DNA molecule in the form of a ring. The DNA has relatively little protein associated with it. The term genophore is sometimes used for the bacterial chromosome to distinguish it from eukaryotic chromosomes, which have a very different structure. The genome of eukaryotes consists of linear DNA molecules packaged along with proteins into multiple chromosomes.

In addition to its one major chromosome, the prokaryotic cell may also have much smaller rings of DNA called plasmids, most consisting of only a few genes. In most environments, prokaryotes can survive without their plasmids because all essential functions are programmed by the chromosome. However, plasmids endow the cell with genes for resistance to antibiotics, for the metabolism of unusual nutrients not present in the normal environment, and for other special contingencies. Plasmids replicate independently of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between partners when prokaryotes conjugate (see FIGURE 18.15).

Although the general processes for DNA replication and the translation of genetic messages into proteins are alike for eukaryotes and prokaryotes, some of the details differ. For example, the prokaryotic ribosome is slightly smaller than the eukaryotic version and differs in its protein and RNA content. The disparity is great enough that selective antibiotics, including tetracycline and chloramphenicol, bind to the ribosomes and block protein synthesis in many prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes.





 Populations of prokaryotes grow and adapt rapidly

Prokaryotes reproduce only asexually by the mode of cell division called binary fission, synthesizing DNA almost continuously (see FIGURE 12.10). A single prokaryotic cell in a favorable environment will give rise by repeated divisions to a colony of offspring (FIGURE 27.9). Note that neither mitosis nor meiosis occurs among prokaryotes; this is another fundamental difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 27-9. Prokaryote colonies in culture. Microbiologists grow laboratory cultures of prokaryotes in liquid or solid media of known composition. The media, in containers such as petri dishes or test tubes, are sterilized to ensure that no unwanted microbes will grow. Then a sample of prokaryotes, sometimes just a single cell, is introduced, and the containers are incubated at an appropriate temperature. When the prokaryotes are grown on solid media, colonies are usually large enough to be visible to the unaided eye after a day or two. The size, shape, texture, and color of a colony provide clues to the identity of the prokaryotes, as do the nutrients and physical conditions required for their growth.

Although prokaryotes are never sexual in the eukaryotic manner of the meiosis-fertilization cycle, they do have three mechanisms that transfer genes between individuals (see Chapter 18). In transformation, a prokaryotic cell takes up genes from the surrounding environment, allowing for considerable genetic transfer between pro ka ryotes, even across species lines. Conjugation is the direct transfer of genes from one prokaryote to another. And in transduction, viruses transfer genes between prokaryotes. These processes, however, involve the unilateral passage of a variable amount of DNA--nothing like the meiotic sex of eukaryotes, in which two parents each contribute homologous genomes to a zygote. Mutation is the major source of genetic variation in prokaryotes. Because generation times are measured in minutes or hours, a favorable mutation can be rapidly propagated to a large number of offspring. This enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change, as natural selection screens new mutations and novel genomes resulting from gene transfer.

The word growth as applied to prokaryotes refers more to the multiplication of cells and an increase in population size than to the enlargement of individual cells. The conditions for optimal growth--temperature, pH, salt concentrations, nutrient sources, and so on--vary according to species. Refrigeration retards food spoilage because most micro or gan isms grow only very slowly at such low temperatures.

In an environment with unlimited resources, the growth of prokaryotes is effectively geometric: One cell divides to form 2, which divide again to produce a total of 4 cells, then 8, 16, and so on, the number of cells in a colony doubling with each generation. Many prokaryotes have generation times in the range of 1-3 hours, but some species can double every 20 minutes in an optimal environment. If the latter growth rate were sustained, a single cell would give rise to a colony outweighing Earth in just three days! Obviously, prokaryotic growth both in the laboratory and in nature is usually checked at some point, when the cells exhaust some nutrient or the colony poisons itself with an accumulation of metabolic wastes. Still, prokaryotes manage to reach astounding population densities--a hundred billion prokaryotes per milliliter of fluid in the human colon, for example.

The ability of some prokaryotes to withstand harsh conditions is also impressive. Some bacteria form resistant cells called endospores (FIGURE 27.10). The original cell replicates its chromosome, and one copy becomes surrounded by a durable wall. The outer cell disintegrates, leaving the highly resistant endospore. Boiling water is not hot enough to kill most endospores in a relatively short length of time. Home canners and the food-canning industry, therefore, must take extra precautions to kill endospores of dangerous bacteria. To sterilize media, glassware, and utensils in the laboratory, microbiologists use an appliance called an autoclave, a pressure cooker that kills even endospores by heating to a temperature of 120&#176;C. In less hostile environments, endospores may remain dormant for centuries or more. If placed in a hospitable environment, they will hydrate and revive to the vegetative (colony-producing) state. For example, in 2000, researchers revived a bacterial spore that had apparently been encased for 250 million years in a salt formation within New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns.

Fig 27-10. An anthrax endospore. This prokaryote is Bacillus anthracis, the notorious bacterium that produces the deadly disease called anthrax in cattle, sheep, and humans (TEM). The outer cell produced the specialized inner cell, called an endospore. The endospore has a thick, protective coat. Its cytoplasm is dehydrated, and the cell does not metabolize. Under harsh conditions, the outer cell may disintegrate, but the endospore survives all sorts of trauma, including lack of water and nutrients, extreme heat or cold, and most poisons. When the environment becomes more hospitable, the endospore absorbs water and resumes growth. In late 2001, one or more bio terrorists disseminated anthrax spores through the U.S. postal system.

In most natural environments, prokaryotes must compete for space and nutrients. Many microorganisms (including certain species of prokaryotes, protists, and fungi) release antibiotics, chemicals that inhibit the growth of other microorganisms. Humans have discovered some of these compounds and use them to combat pathogenic bacteria.





 Prokaryotes can be grouped into four categories according to how they obtain energy and carbon

Nutrition refers here to how an organism obtains two resources from the environment: energy and a carbon source to build the organic molecules of cells. Species that use light energy are called phototrophs. Chemotrophs obtain their energy from chemicals taken from the environment. If an organism needs only the inorganic compound CO2 as a carbon source, it is called an autotroph. Heterotrophs require at least one organic nutrient--glucose, for instance--as a source of carbon for making other organic compounds. We can combine the phototroph-versus-chemotroph (energy source) and autotroph-versus-heterotroph (carbon source) criteria to group prokaryotes according to four major modes of nutrition:

Photoautotrophs are photosynthetic organisms that harness light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Among the diverse groups of photoautotrophic prokaryotes are the cyanobacteria. All photosynthetic eukaryotes--plants and algae--also fit into this nutritional category.

Chemoautotrophs need only CO2 as a carbon source, but instead of using light for energy, these prokaryotes obtain energy by oxidizing inorganic substances. Chemical energy is extracted from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), ferrous ions (Fe2+), or some other chemical, depending on the species. This mode of nutrition is unique to certain prokaryotes. Some of the species that extract energy by oxidizing minerals in stone are "eating away" at some of the world's greatest statues.

Photoheterotrophs can use light to generate ATP but must obtain their carbon in organic form. This mode of nutrition is restricted to certain prokaryotes.

Chemoheterotrophs must consume organic molecules for both energy and carbon. This nutritional mode is found widely among prokaryotes, protists, fungi, animals, and even some parasitic plants.

TABLE 27.1 reviews the four major modes of nutrition.

The majority of known prokaryotes are chemoheterotrophs. This category includes saprobes, decomposers that absorb their nutrients from dead organic matter, and parasites, which absorb their nutrients from the body fluids of living hosts.

The specific organic nutrients needed for growth vary extensively among chemoheterotrophic prokaryotes. Some species are very exacting in their requirements; for example, bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus will grow well only in a medium containing all 20 amino acids, several vitamins, and other organic compounds. Among species less particular in their nutritional needs, E. coli can grow on a medium containing glucose as the only organic ingredient, and the organism's metabolism is so versatile that many other compounds can substitute for glucose as the sole organic nutrient.

There is such a diversity of chemoheterotrophs that almost any organic molecule can serve as food for at least some species. For example, some bacteria are capable of metabolizing petroleum; they are used to clean up oil spills. Those few classes of synthetic organic compounds (including some kinds of plastics) that cannot be broken down by any chemohetero trophs are said to be nonbiodegradable.

Nitrogen Metabolism

Nitrogen metabolism is another area of nutritional diversity among prokaryotes. Nitrogen is an essential component of proteins and nucleic acids. While animals, plants, and other eukaryotes are limited in the forms of nitrogen they can use, diverse prokaryotes are able to metabolize most nitrogenous compounds.

Key steps in the cycling of nitrogen through ecosystems are performed only by prokaryotes. (For an overview of the nitrogen cycle, see FIGURE 54.18.) Some chemoautotrophic bacteria in the soil, such as Nitrosomonas, convert ammonium (NH4+) to nitrite (NO2-). Other bacteria, such as a few species of Pseudomonas, "denitrify" soil nitrite or nitrate (NO3-), a metabolism that returns nitrogen gas (N2) to the atmosphere. And diverse species of prokaryotes, including some cyanobacteria, are able to use atmospheric nitrogen directly as a source of nitrogen. In this process, called nitrogen fixation, prokaryotes convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonium (NH4+). Nitrogen fixation, unique to certain prokaryotes, is the only biological mechanism that makes atmospheric nitrogen available to organisms for incorporation into organic compounds. In terms of nutrition, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are the most self-sufficient of all organisms. These photo autotrophs require only light energy, CO2, N2, water, and some minerals in order to grow (FIGURE 27.11).

Fig 27-11. One of the most independent organisms on Earth. A photoautotroph that can use atmospheric nitrogen (N2) as its nitrogen source, Anabaena is an example of the metabolic virtuosity of cyanobacteria. The specialized cells with the enzymes for nitrogen fixation are called heterocysts (LM).

Metabolic Relationships to Oxygen

Another metabolic variation among prokaryotes is in the effect that oxygen has on growth (see Chapter 9). Obligate aerobes use O2 for cellular respiration and cannot grow without it. Facultative anaerobes will use O2 if it is present but can also grow by fermentation in an anaerobic environment. Obligate anaerobes are poisoned by O2. Some obligate anaerobes live exclusively by fermentation; other species extract chemical energy by anaerobic respiration, in which inorganic molecules other than O2 accept electrons at the "downhill" end of electron transport chains.

Now that we have surveyed variation in nutrition and metabolism among prokaryotes, let's trace the evolutionary roots of this metabolic diversity.





 Photosynthesis evolved early in prokaryotic life

All forms of nutrition and nearly all metabolic pathways evolved among prokaryotes before there were any eukaryotes. As early prokaryotes evolved, they were met with constantly changing physical and biological environments. In response to these changes, new metabolic capabilities evolved that in turn changed the environment faced by the next community of prokaryotes. All the major metabolic capabilities seen among prokaryotes (and hence among eukaryotes) probably evolved in the first billion years of life. And during this expansion of metabolic diver sity, photosynthesis evolved relatively early--a hypothesis supported by molecular systematics, comparisons of energy me tabolism among extant prokaryotes, and geologic evidence.

The energy metabolism of even the simplest photoauto trophs is relatively complex. Thus, it seems reasonable to postulate that the very first prokaryotes were heterotrophs that obtained their energy and carbon skeletons from the pool of organic molecules available in the "primordial soup" of early Earth (see Chapter 26). Glycolysis, which can extract energy from organic fuels to generate ATP in anaerobic environments, was probably one of the first metabolic pathways. That would account for the existence of glycolysis in almost every group of modern organisms. As heterotrophs depleted the supply of organic nutrients in the environment, natu ral selection would have favored any prokaryotes that could harness the energy of sunlight to drive the synthesis of ATP and generate reducing power to synthesize organic compounds from CO2.

What evidence is there for an early evolution of photosynthesis? First, photosynthetic groups are scattered among diverse branches of prokaryote phylogeny. It is possible that photosynthesis evolved independently many times in various prokaryotic lineages (FIGURE 27.12a). This seems unlikely, however, since the molecular machinery required for photosynthesis is very complex. Applying the principle of parsimony we dis cussed in Chapter 25, the most reasonable hypothesis is that photosynthesis originated once in an ancestor common to the diverse prokaryotic groups where we find photosynthesis today. The heterotrophic groups that are closely related to photosynthetic ones could represent a loss of photosynthetic ability during evolution (FIGURE 27.12b). This would explain molecular data suggesting that in nutritionally diverse taxa of prokaryotes, the autotrophic species are generally older lineages than the heterotrophic ones. Although the very first organisms may have been heterotrophs from which autotrophs evolved, the diversity of heterotrophs we observe today probably descended secondarily from photosynthetic ancestors.

Fig 27-12. Contrasting hypotheses for the taxonomic distribution of photosynthesis among prokaryotes.

Further evidence for an early origin of photosynthesis is the antiquity of cyanobacteria. These are the only autotrophic prokaryotes that release O2 by splitting water during their light reactions. The geologic evidence for accumulation of atmospheric oxygen beginning at least 2.7 billion years ago suggests that cyanobacteria were already a major part of the biosphere by then. And fossils of prokaryotes that look very much like modern cyanobacteria have been found in stromatolites as old as 3.5 billion years, pushing the possible origin of oxygenic photosynthesis back considerably further.

Oxygenic photosynthesis is especially complex because it requires two cooperative photosystems (see FIGURE 10.12). Some groups of modern prokaryotes perform a simpler mode of photosynthesis, using a single photosystem to extract electrons from compounds such as H2S instead of splitting water. But certain components of the photosynthetic machinery are common to such nonoxygenic photosynthesis and the oxygenic version in cyanobacteria. A logical inference is that cyanobacteria evolved from ancestors with simpler, nonoxygenic photosynthesis. This would push the origin of photosynthesis back very close to our earliest fossil evidence of life.

The evolution of cyanobacteria changed the Earth in a radical way, gradually transforming its atmosphere from a reducing one to an oxidizing one. In Chapter 25, we discussed how the oxygen revolution posed an environmental crisis for life, which originated in a mostly anaerobic world. The most elegant adaptation to the changing atmosphere was the evolution of cellular respiration, which uses the oxidizing power of O2 to increase the efficiency of fuel consumption. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are actually closely related, both using electron transport chains to generate proton gradients that power ATP synthase machines (see FIGURE 10.15). Given the early origin of photosynthesis, it is likely that cellular respiration evolved by modification of the photosynthetic equipment for a new function.

Now that we have applied this book's theme of evolution to the origin of metabolic diversity in prokaryotes, let's survey the diverse groups of archaea and bacteria that continue to have enormous impact on Earth and its life.





 Molecular systematics is leading to a phylogenetic classification of prokaryotes

A classification of prokaryotic life that reflects evolutionary history was impossible until the development of molecular systematics. Neither the fossil record nor comparative morphology are of much help in working out details of prokaryotic phylogeny. The major lineages diverged during the very early history of life and left a limited fossil record. And because prokaryotes are so structurally simple compared to macroscopic, eukaryotic organisms, comparing the structure of modern prokaryotic species does not turn up much in the way of derived characters that are useful in cladistic analysis (see Chapter 25).

The breakthrough came when Carl Woese and his colleagues, mentioned earlier, began to cluster contemporary prokaryotes into taxonomic groups based on comparisons of nucleic acid sequences. The molecular material that turned out to be particularly useful is the RNA found in the smaller of the two subunits of ribosomes. Because all cells have ribosomes, Woese reasoned that the gene for the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) has a history extending from the very first prokaryotes to the entire diversity of modern life. Each group of organisms has signature sequences, regions of its SSU-rRNA that have unique nucleotide sequences acquired by an accumulation of mutations in the ancestor of that taxonomic group. Thus, Woese found a way to define the very deepest branchings in the tree of life. FIGURE 27.13 (p. 536) diagrams the phylogeny of some of the major groups of prokaryotes as sorted by molecular systematics.

Fig 27-13. Some major groups of prokaryotes. This tentative phylogeny, like all such trees, is a hypothesis about evolutionary history. This simplified tree--consisting only of those prokaryotic groups that are discussed in this chapter--is based on molecular systematics, particularly comparisons of SSU-rRNA signature sequences. The groups shown here might be considered kingdoms within domains Bacteria and Archaea. However, many systematists prefer to wait for more data before assigning the groups to ranked taxonomic categories, such as kingdoms and phyla. This tree includes a "universal ancestor" common to all life, but we'll see evidence in Chapter 28 that the deepest branchings of life may have emerged not from a single ancestor but from an ancestral community of gene-swapping prokaryotes.

Before molecular systematics, prokaryotic taxonomy was based on such phenotypic characters as nutritional mode and gram-positive versus gram-negative staining behavior (see FIGURE 27.5). Such criteria remain useful for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in the clinical labs of hospitals. The telltale signs of a particular bacterial species cultured from a patient's blood or other body fluid may be its shape as viewed with a microscope, its response to the Gram stain, whether or not the pathogen is motile, and what nutrients are required to grow the bacteria on a culture medium. For the most part, however, these clinically useful phenotypes are a poor guide to phylogeny. We have seen, for example, how the various nutritional modes are scattered around the phylogenetic tree of prokaryotes. However, a few of the traditional phenotype-based groups do persist in a phylogenetic classification based on molecular methods. For instance, note in FIGURE 27.13 that the cyanobacteria and the spirochetes cluster into two distinct lineages in the prokaryotic phylogeny. And although the gram-positive bacteria are very diverse, they all cluster into a single major prokaryotic branch. However, the gram-negative bacteria are scattered throughout several lineages; there are even some species that are gram-negative in staining behavior but are now included in the taxon called "gram-positive," so named because most of its members are gram-positive.

Researchers have now sequenced the complete ge nomes of several prokaryotes, producing an enormous database that has supported most of the taxonomic conclusions based on SSU-rRNA comparison but has also produced some surprises. For example, in Chapter 28 we'll discuss how rampant gene swapping within early communities of prokaryotes left a record in the genomes of all modern organisms, including humans.





 Researchers are identifying a great diversity of archaea in extreme environments and in the oceans

Note again in FIGURE 27.13 the very early divergence into two main prokaryotic lineages that are now designated the domains Archaea and Bacteria. TABLE 27.2 (p. 537) summarizes some differences between these two main prokaryotic groups. The table includes the third domain of life, Eukarya, to reinforce the point made earlier that the archaea have at least as much in common with eukaryotes as they do with bacteria. However, the archaea also have many unique characteristics, which we would expect of a taxon that has followed a separate evolutionary path for so long.

However, much of the research so far on the archaea has focused not on their phylogeny, but on their ecology--on the ability of many archaea to live where no other life can. We can think of these creatures as extremophiles,"lovers" of extreme environments, such as the hot-water geyser shown in FIGURE 27.1. In addition to phylogenetic classification, it is useful to classify the extremeophiles into three groups based on environmental criteria: methanogens, extreme halophiles, and extreme thermophiles.

The methanogens are named for the unique way they obtain energy by using CO2 to oxidize H2, producing methane (CH4) as a waste product. Methanogens, among the strictest of anaerobes, are poisoned by oxygen. They live in swamps and marshes where other microbes have consumed all the oxygen; the methane that bubbles out at these sites is known as marsh gas. Methanogens are also important decomposers used in sewage treatment. Some farmers have experimented with the use of these microbes to convert garbage and dung to methane, a valuable fuel. Other species of methanogens inhabit the anaerobic environment within the guts of animals, playing an important role in the nutrition of cattle, termites, and other herbivores that subsist mainly on a diet of cellulose. This gas production does not normally bloat cows because the animals belch out large volumes of the methane. On a global scale, methanogens produce enough methane to play a major role in the greenhouse effect, an atmospheric phenomenon you will learn about in Chapter 54.

The extreme halophiles (from the Greek halo, salt, and philos, lover) live in such saline places as the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Some species merely tolerate salinity, whereas others actually require an environment ten times saltier than seawater to grow (FIGURE 27.14). Colonies of halophiles form a purple-red scum that owes its color to bacteriorhodopsin, a photosynthetic pigment very similar to the visual pigments in the retinas of our eyes.

Fig 27-14. Extreme halophiles. The colors of these seawater evaporating ponds at the edge of San Francisco Bay result from a dense growth of extreme halophiles that thrive in the ponds when the water reaches a salinity of 15-20% . (Before evaporation, the salinity of seawater is about 3% .) The ponds are used for commercial salt production; the salt-loving archaea are harmless.

As their name implies, the extreme thermophiles thrive in hot environments. The optimal conditions for most of these archaea are temperatures of 60-80&#176;C. Sulfolobus inhabits hot sulfur springs in Yellowstone National Park, obtaining its energy by oxidizing sulfur. Another sulfur-metabolizing thermophile lives in the 105&#176;C water near deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

Some researchers postulate that the very earliest prokaryotes to evolve were extreme thermophiles that inhabited hot environments similar to deep-sea vents. This would make it more historically accurate to consider most forms of life, including humans, as "cold adapted," rather than viewing the thermophilic archaea, which have continued to inhabit hot environments, as "extreme."

Until recently, researchers thought that archaea were prevalent organisms mainly in extreme environments where other life-forms were essentially absent. However, in the past decade, scientists have discovered that an abundance of marine archaea live among other forms of life in the more moderate habitats of the oceans.

To return to the phylogenetic classification in FIGURE 27.13, all the methanogens and halophiles fit into Euryarchaeota. (The word root "eury" means "broad," a reference here to the variety and habitat range of these prokaryotes.) This archaean group also includes some thermophiles, though most of the thermophilic species belong to Crenarchaeota. (The word root "cren" means "spring," as in hydrothermal vents.) Each of these two taxa also includes some of the newly discovered marine archaea.

Because bacteria have been the prokaryotic subjects of most research throughout the history of microbiology, much more is known about them than about the archaea. Now that the evolutionary and ecological importance of the archaea have come into focus, we can expect research on this domain to turn up many more surprises about the history of life and the roles of microbes in ecosystems.





 Most known prokaryotes are bacteria

The term bacteria was once synonymous with "prokaryotes," but molecular systematics changed that when it became clear that prokaryotic life is represented by two distinct domains. It's a bit confusing that the name Bacteria was reassigned as the title of just one prokaryotic domain, Archaea being the other. True, most of the known prokaryotes are bacteria, but the archaea may catch up now that there is so much interest in describing their diversity.

Every major mode of nutrition and metabolism is represented among the thousands of known species of bacteria. And as mentioned earlier, multiple nutritional types may be represented within a particular taxonomic group of bacteria. If you return to FIGURE 27.13, you'll see five major bacterial groups identified (we've omitted several other groups). As with the two main groups of archaea, the major bacterial taxa are now accorded kingdom status by some prokaryotic systematists. We've organized our description of these monophyletic groups (clades) into TABLE 27.3 (pp. 538-539).

Table 27-3. Five of the Major Clades of Bacteria

Group/DescriptionExampleProteobacteriaThis large and diverse clade of gram-negative bacteria includes photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, and hetero trophs. Proteobacteria include both anaerobic and aerobic species. Molecular systematists recognize five subgroups of proteo bacterial species.Alpha ProteobacteriaMany of the species in this group are closely associated with eukaryotic hosts, either as mutual symbionts or as parasites. For example, Rhizobium species live in nodules within the roots of legumes (plants of the pea/bean family), where the bacteria convert atmospheric N2 to compounds the host plant can use to make proteins. Species of the genus Agrobacterium are pathogens that cause tumors to form in plants; genetic engineers use these bacteria to carry foreign DNA into the genomes of crop plants (see FIGURE 20.19). The rickettsias, tiny even by bacterial standards, are pathogens that live within the cells of animals, causing such diseases as Rocky Mountain spotted fever in humans. Mitochondria, the sites of cellular respiration in eukaryotic cells, evolved from an aerobic alphas that inhabited a larger host cell, a phenomenon called endosymbiosis, which we will examine in detail in Chapter 28.



Rhizobium; the arrows point to the bacteria inside root cells of a legume (TEM)Beta ProteobacteriaThis nutritionally diverse group includes Nitrosomonas, soil bacteria that play an important role in nitrogen recycling within ecosystems by oxidizing ammonium (NH4+), producing nitrite (NO2-) as a waste product.Gamma ProteobacteriaAmong the photosynthetic members of this group are sulfur bacteria such as Chromatium, which split H2S as a source of electrons to make organic molecules. The yellow globules in the Chromatium cells in the photo are sulfur wastes from photosynthesis. Among the heterotrophic gammas are some pathogens, including Legionella, named for the discovery that it causes Legionnaires' disease. Other gammas are enterics (bacteria that inhabit animal intestines), including Salmonella, one of the microbes that causes food poisoning; Vibrio cholerae, the pathogen that causes cholera; and the famous Escherichia coli, a species from the human intestine. The presence of E. coli in the water supply is a sign of contamination with feces. You may remember E. coli as one of the most important research organisms in molecular biology and DNA tech nology (see Chapters 16 and 20).



Chromatium; the yellow globules are sulfur wastes from H2S-splitting photosynthesis (LM)Delta ProteobacteriaOne group of deltas, the myxobacteria, form the most elaborate colonies of all prokaryotes. The cells secrete a slimy substratum on which they glide through soil (myxa is Greek for "mucus"). When the soil dries out or food becomes scarce, the cells congregate and erect a bulbous "fruiting" body, which may be brightly colored and as large as a millimeter in diameter. The fruiting body releases resistant spores that become active and found new colonies in favorable environments. Another delta group, the bdellovibrios, are predators that attack other bacteria. A bdellovibrio charges its prey at a speed of 100 &uuml;m per second, which, relatively speaking, is like a human running about 600 km per hour, half the speed of sound! Then the predator turns into a bacterial drill, boring into its prey by spinning at 100 revolutions per second.

Helicobacter pylori, which causes stomach ulcers (colorized TEM)ChlamydiasThese parasites can survive only within the cells of animals, depending on their hosts for resources as basic as ATP. The gram-negative walls of chlamydias are unusual among bacteria in that they lack peptidoglycan. One species, Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most common cause of blindness in the world and also causes nongonococcal urethritis, the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.



Chlamydias (arrows) living inside an animal cell (colorized TEM)SpirochetesSome of these helical heterotrophs are 0.25 mm long, though too thin to be visible without a microscope. Rotation of internal flagellum-like filaments produces a corkscrewlike movement. Many spirochetes are free- living, but the group also includes some notorious pathogens: Treponema pallidum causes the STD syphilis, and Borrelia burgdorferi is the pathogen of Lyme disease.



Leptospira, a spirochete (colorized TEM)Gram-Positive BacteriaAll gram-positive bacteria cluster in this clade, but the group also includes some closely related gram-negative species. This branch of bacteria rivals the proteobacteria in diversity.One gram-positive subgroup, the actinomycetes, forms colonies with branched chains of cells (the mycetes part of the name means "fungus," for which these bacteria were once mistaken). Two actinomycetes of medical importance are the species that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. But most actinomycetes are free-living species that help decompose the organic litter in soil; their secretions are partly responsible for the "earthy" odor of rich soil. Soil-dwelling species of the genus Streptomyces are cultured by pharmaceutical companies as a source of many antibiotics, including streptomycin.In addition to the colonial actinomycetes, the gram-positive group also includes a diversity of solitary species. There are spore formers such as Bacillus and Clostridium. Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis (see FIGURE 27.10). Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin that causes the potentially fatal disease botulism. The various species of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are also gram-positive bacteria.The most structurally unusual members of the gram-positive clade are the mycoplasmas, which are the only bacteria lacking cell walls and which are the smallest of all known cells, with diameters as tiny as 0.1 &uuml;m, only about five times the diameter of a ribosome. Many mycoplasmas are soil bacteria, but there are also pathogens, including a species that causes "walking pneumonia" in humans.

Hundreds of mycoplasmas cover this human fibroblast cell (colorized SEM)CyanobacteriaThese photoautotrophs are the only prokaryotes with plantlike, oxygenic photosynthesis. (In fact, chloroplasts evolved from a cyanobacterium that lived as an endosymbiont within a larger host cell; see Chapter 28). Both solitary and colonial cyanobacteria are abundant wherever there is water, providing an enormous amount of food for freshwater and marine ecosystems. Some filamentous colonies have cells specialized for nitrogen fixation, the metabolic process that converts atmospheric N2 to compounds that can be incorporated into proteins and other organic molecules (see FIGURE 27.11).



Cyanobacteria: Scytonema (LM)



 Prokaryotes are indispensable links in the recycling of chemical elements in ecosystems

Not too long ago, in geologic terms, the atoms of the organic molecules in our bodies were parts of the inorganic compounds of soil, air, and water, as they will be again. Ongoing life depends on the recycling of chemical elements between the biological and physical components of ecosystems. Prokaryotes play essential roles in these chemical cycles (to be discussed in detail in Chapter 54). If it were not for such decomposers, carbon, nitrogen, and other elements essential to life would become locked in the organic molecules of corpses and waste products.

Prokaryotes also mediate the return of elements from the nonliving components of the environment (air, inorganic soil, and water) to the pool of organic compounds. Autotrophic prokaryotes make organic compounds from CO2, supporting food chains through which organic nutrients pass from the prokaryotes to prokaryote eaters, then on to secondary consumers.

Because of their many unique metabolic capabilities, prokaryotes are the only organisms able to metabolize inorganic molecules containing elements such as iron, sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Cyanobacteria not only synthesize food and restore oxygen to the atmosphere, but also fix nitrogen, stocking the soil and water with nitrogenous compounds that other organisms can use to make proteins. And when plants and the animals that eat them die, soil prokaryotes return the nitrogen to the atmosphere. All life on Earth depends on prokaryotes and their unparalleled metabolic diversity.





 Many prokaryotes are symbiotic

Prokaryotes rarely function singly in the environment. More often they interact in groups, which often include other species of prokaryotes or eukaryotes with complementary metabolisms.

Symbiosis (from the Greek word for "living together") is the term used to describe ecological relationships between organisms of different species that are in direct contact. If one of the symbiotic organisms is much larger than the other, the larger is called the host. There are three categories of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. In mutualism, both symbiotic organisms benefit (FIGURE 27.15). In commensalism, one organism receives benefits while neither harming nor helping the other in any significant way. In parasitism, one symbiotic organism, called a parasite in this case, benefits at the expense of the host.

Fig 27-15. Mutualism: bacterial "headlights." The lighted oval under the eye of this deep-sea fish is an organ harboring symbiotic bacteria that are bioluminescent. A chemical reaction powered by ATP emits the light. The fish uses its headlamps to lure light-seeking prey and to signal potential mates.

Prokaryotes are represented in all three categories of symbiosis with eukaryotes. For example, plants of the legume family (peas, beans, alfalfa, and others) have lumps on their roots called nodules, which are home to mutualistic prokaryotes that fix nitrogen used by the host (see Rhizobium in TABLE 27.3). The plant reciprocates by providing the pro karyotes with a steady supply of sugar and other organic nutrients. Bacteria inhabiting the inner and outer surfaces of the human body consist mostly of commensal species, but some species are mutualistic symbionts. For instance, fermenting bacteria living in the vagina produce acids that maintain a pH between 4.0 and 4.5, suppressing the growth of yeast and other potentially harmful microorganisms. Among parasitic bacteria are those classified as pathogens because they cause disease in their hosts.





 Pathogenic prokaryotes cause many human diseases

Most of us are well most of the time because our defenses check the growth of pathogens to which we are exposed. Occasionally, the balance shifts in favor of a pathogen, and we become ill. To be pathogenic, a parasite must invade the host, resist internal defenses long enough to begin growing, then harm the host in some way. Pathogenic prokaryotes cause about half of all human diseases (FIGURE 27.16).

Fig 27-16. A very harmful "germ." The yellow rods are Haemophilus influenzae bacteria on skin cells lining the interior of a human nose (colorized SEM). These pathogens are transmitted through the air. H. influenzae, not to be confused with influenza (flu) viruses, causes pneumonia and other lung infections that kill about 4 million people worldwide per year. Most victims are children in developing countries, where malnutrition lowers resistance to all pathogens.

Some pathogens are opportunistic, meaning they are normal residents of a host but can cause illness when the host's defenses are weakened by such factors as poor nutrition or a recent bout with the flu. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae (a gram-positive bacter ium) lives in the throats of most healthy people, but this opportunist can multiply and cause pneumonia when the host's defenses are down.

Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and other scientists began linking disease to pathogenic microbes in the late 1800s. The first to actually connect certain diseases to specific bacteria was Robert Koch, a German physician who identified the bacteria responsible for anthrax and tuberculosis. His methods established four criteria, now called Koch's postulates, that are still the guidelines for medical microbiology. To establish that a specific pathogen is the cause of a disease, the researcher must (1) find the same pathogen in each diseased individual investigated, (2) isolate the pathogen from a diseased subject and grow the microbe in a pure culture, (3) induce the disease in experimental animals by transferring the pathogen from the culture, and (4) isolate the same pathogen from the experimental animals after the disease develops. The postulates work for most pathogens, but exceptions do occur. For example, no one has yet cultured the spirochete Treponema pallidum on artificial media, but circumstantial evidence leaves no doubt that this organism causes syphilis.

How do pathogenic prokaryotes produce symptoms of disease? Some species, such as the gram-positive actinomycete that causes tuberculosis, disrupt the health of the host by invading tissues. More commonly, pathogens cause illness by producing poisons called exotoxins and endotoxins.

Exotoxins are proteins secreted by prokaryotes. Exotoxins can produce disease symptoms even without the prokaryotes being present. For example, when the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum (see TABLE 27.3) grows anaerobically in improperly canned foods, one of the by-products of its fermentation is an exotoxin that causes the potentially fatal disease botulism. Some exotoxins are among the most potent poisons known; just 1 g of botulism toxin would be sufficient to kill a million people. Another exotoxin-producing species is the enteric proteobacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, a dangerous disease characterized by severe diarrhea. Resulting from the consumption of water contaminated with human feces, cholera is often epidemic during wars and famines. Even E. coli can be an exotoxin-releasing culprit. Some cases of traveler's diarrhea result from toxins released by strains of E. coli obtained from another person via contaminated food or water.

In contrast to exotoxins, endotoxins are components of the outer membranes of certain gram-negative bacteria. Examples of endotoxin-producing bacteria include nearly all members of the genus Salmonella, which are not normally present in healthy animals. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever, and several other species of Salmonella, some of which are commonly found in poultry, cause food poisoning.

Since the discovery in the 19th century that "germs" cause disease, improved sanitation has significantly reduced infant mortality and extended life expectancy in developed countries. Antibiotics have also saved many lives and reduced disease incidence. More than half of our antibiotics (including streptomycin, neomycin, erythromycin, aureomycin, and tetracycline) come from soil bacteria of the genus Streptomyces (an actinomycete; see TABLE 27.3). In nature, these compounds prevent encroachment by competing microbes.

Bacterial diseases are a continuing threat. Their general decline over the past century is probably due more to public health policies and education than to "wonder drugs." A case in point is Lyme disease, currently the most widespread pest-carried disease in the United States. The disease is caused by a spirochete bacterium carried by ticks that live on deer and field mice (FIGURE 27.17). Lyme disease usually starts as a red rash shaped like a bull's-eye around a tick bite. Antibiotics can cure the disease if administered within about a month after exposure. If untreated, Lyme disease can cause debilitating arthritis, heart disease, and nervous disorders. A vaccine is now available, but it does not give full protection. The best defense is public education about avoiding tick bites and seeking treatment if a rash develops. When walking through brush, it is advisable to use insect repellent and wear light-colored clothing to reduce contact with ticks.

Today, the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria is a serious health threat aggravated by imprudent and excessive antibiotic use.

Although declared illegal by the United Nations, the selective culturing and stockpiling of deadly bacterial disease agents for use as biological weapons remains a threat to world peace.





 Humans use prokaryotes in research and technology

Humans have learned many ways of exploiting the diverse metabolic capabilities of prokaryotes, both for scientific research and for practical purposes. Much of what we know about metabolism and molecular biology has been learned in laboratories using prokaryotes as relatively simple model systems. In fact, E. coli, the prokaryotic "white rat" of so many research labs, is the best understood of all organisms. And we are just beginning to explore the great potential prokaryotes have for helping us solve some of our environmental problems.

The use of organisms to remove pollutants from water, air, and soil is called bioremediation. The most familiar example of bioremediation is the use of prokaryotic decomposers to treat our sewage. Raw sewage is first passed through a series of screens and shredders, and solid matter is allowed to settle out from the liquid waste. This solid matter, called sludge, is then gradually added to a culture of anaerobic prokaryotes, including both bacteria and archaea. The microbes decompose the organic matter in the sludge, converting it to material that can be used as landfill or fertilizer after chemical sterilization. Liquid wastes are treated separately from the sludge (FIGURE 27.18). In other examples of bioremediation, soil bacteria called pseudomonads (proteobacteria) are used to decompose petroleum compounds on beaches and other sites of oil spills and to decompose a variety of synthetic compounds, such as pesticides (FIGURE 27.19). Genetic engineers are improving the bioremediation powers of certain prokaryotes.

Fig 27-18. Putting prokaryotes to work in sewage treatment facilities. This is a trickling filter system, one type of mechanism for treating liquid wastes after sludge is removed. The long horizontal pipes rotate slowly, spraying liquid wastes through the air onto a thick bed of rocks. Bacteria and fungi growing on the rocks remove much of the organic material dissolved in the waste. Outflow from the rock bed is sterilized and then released, usually into a river or ocean.

Fig 27-19. Bioremediation for an oil spill. A worker is spraying fertilizers on an oil-soaked beach in Alaska. The fertilizers stimulate growth of indigenous bacteria that can initiate the breakdown of the oil--in some cases, speeding the natural process of breakdown some fivefold. This technique is the fastest and least expensive way yet devised to clean up oil spills on beaches.

Humans also put bacteria to work as metabolic "factories" for commercial products. The chemical industry grows immense cultures of bacteria that produce acetone, butanol, and several other products. Pharmaceutical companies culture bacteria that make vitamins and antibiotics. Bacteria containing magnetic particles may soon become a commercial source for manufacturing magnetic tapes and other recording devices. The food industry uses bacteria to convert milk to yogurt and various kinds of cheese. And DNA technology has opened a new era in the commercial use of prokaryotes (see Chapter 20).

In this chapter, we have surveyed the prokaryotes and traced their history. On an ancient Earth inhabited only by prokaryotes, all the diverse forms of nutrition and metabolism evolved. Most subsequent evolutionary breakthroughs were structural rather than metabolic. The most significant development was the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic ancestors, which we will explore in the next chapter.

"No more pleasant sight has met my eye than this of so many thousands of living creatures in one small drop of water," wrote Anton van Leeuwenhoek after his discovery of the microbial world more than three centuries ago. It is a world every biology student rediscovers by peering through a microscope into a droplet of pond water filled with diverse creatures we call protists (see the photograph on this page).

Protists are eukaryotic, and thus even the simplest protists are much more complex than the prokaryotes. The first eukaryotes to evolve from prokaryotic ancestors were unicellular. The primal eukaryotes were not only the predecessors of the great variety of modern protists but were also ancestral to all other eukaryotes--plants, fungi, and animals. Two of the most significant chapters in the history of life--the origin of the eukaryotic cell and the subsequent emergence of multicellular eukaryotes--unfolded during the evolution of protists.

This chapter traces the origins of eukaryotic cells, examines the diversity, evolution, and ecology of protists, and considers the evolutionary origins of multicellular organization.





INTRODUCTION TO THE PROTISTS

 

 Systematists have split protists into many kingdoms



 

 Protists are the most diverse of all eukaryotes



In Chapter 26, we discussed eukaryotic fossils that are 2.1 billion years old and "chemical signatures" characteristic of eukaryotes dating back 2.7 billion years. For about 2 billion years before there were animals, fungi, and plants, the early eukaryotes gave rise to a great diversity of the mostly microscopic organisms we know by the informal name "protists."

Even a very small protist such as Euglena, shown in FIGURE 28.3, is far more complex in structure than any prokaryote. During the genesis of protists, the cellular structures and processes unique to eukaryotic cells arose: a membrane-enclosed nucleus, the endomembrane system, mitochondria, chloroplasts, the cytoskeleton, 9 + 2 flagella, multiple chromosomes consisting of linear DNA molecules compactly arranged with proteins, and life cycles that include mitosis, meiosis, and sex. Among the most fundamental questions in biology is how the complex eukaryotic cell evolved from much simpler prokaryotic cells.

 Systematists have split protists into many kingdoms

Molecular systematics and cladistics are combining to chip away at the traditional five-kingdom system of classification (see FIGURE 26.15). A single prokaryotic kingdom, Monera, is incompatible with the new three-domain system that divides the prokaryotes into two superkingdoms, or domains: the domain Bacteria and the domain Archaea (see Chapter 27). Within the third domain, Eukarya, we find all of the eukaryotes, which were divided in the five-kingdom system into four kingdoms: Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. The plant, fungus, and animal kingdoms are surviving the taxonomic remodeling so far, though their boundaries have expanded somewhat to include certain groups formerly classified as protists. However, the kingdom Protista has been crumbled beyond repair by the methods of modern systematics.

A protist kingdom was always a bit of a problem, even when the five-kingdom system was in its prime. Protista was defined partly by its members' structure--containing mostly unicellular eukaryotes--and partly by its role as a receptacle for all those eukaryotes that do not fit our definitions of plants, fungi, or animals. While most organisms classified as protists are single-celled and microscopic, the kingdom also included some relatively simple multicellular forms and even some relatively complex giants, such as seaweeds. Thus, organisms as diverse as amoebas and kelp (brown seaweeds) were classified in the same kingdom (FIGURE 28.1). The main thing they had in common was that they were not animals, fungi, or true plants (as we'll define them in the next chapter). The kingdom Protista was convenient, but it has not stood up to phylogenetic scrutiny. Certain protists are far less closely related to each other than plants are to animals. And certain protists are more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists. To use the terminology of cladistics, the kingdom Protista was paraphyletic (FIGURE 28.2; also see FIGURE 25.9).

Fig 28-1. Too diverse for one kingdom: a small sample of protists. Though systematists have split the five-kingdom system's Protista into many kingdoms, "protist" is still a convenient informal term for the great diversity of eukaryotes that are not plants, fungi, or animals.

Fig 28-2. The kingdom Protista problem. In this simplified tree of eukaryotes, the diverse lineages that were once combined in the kingdom Protista are highlighted by the yellow background. It was a paraphyletic taxon (see FIGURE 25.9).

As biologists learned more about various groups of protists, the inclusion of such diverse lineages within a single kingdom became phylogenetically untenable. Systematists have split what was once the kingdom Protista into as many as 20 kingdoms. However, most biologists use "protist" as an informal term for this great diversity of eukaryotic kingdoms.





 Protists are the most diverse of all eukaryotes

Given the taxonomic fragmentation of the protists into multiple kingdoms, you shouldn't be surprised that protists are so diverse that few general characteristics can be cited without exceptions. In fact, protists vary in structure and function more than any other group of organisms. Most of the approximately 60,000 known species of extant protists are unicellular, but there are also some colonial and multicellular species (see FIGURE 28.1). Because most protists are unicellular, they are justifiably considered the simplest eukaryotic organisms. But at the cellular level, many protists are exceedingly complex--the most elaborate of all cells. We should expect this of organisms that must carry out within the boundaries of a single cell all the basic functions performed by the specialized cells that make up the bodies of plants and animals. Each unicellular protist is not at all analogous to a single cell from a human or other multicellular organism, but is itself an organism as complete as any whole plant or animal.

Nutrition

Protists are the most nutritionally diverse of all eukaryotes. Most protists are aerobic in their metabolism, using mitochondria for cellular respiration (a few lack mitochondria and either live in anaerobic environments or contain mutualistic respiring bacteria). Some protists are photoautotrophs, containing chloroplasts; some are heterotrophs, absorbing organic molecules or ingesting larger food particles; and still others, called mixotrophs, combine photosynthesis and heterotrophic nutrition (an example is Euglena, shown in FIGURE 28.3).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 28-3. Euglena: an example of a single-celled protist. This protist, one of the most common inhabitants of murky pond water, is mixotrophic: In light, its chloroplasts are photosynthetic; if placed in the dark, the organism can live as a heterotroph by absorbing organic nutrients from the environment. Some related species lack chloroplasts and ingest food by phagocytosis.

The different modes of nutrition are scattered throughout the various phylogenetic lineages of protists. For example, there are photosynthetic species in many different protistan groups. And the same group may include photosynthetic species, heterotrophic species, and mixotrophs. Thus, nutrition is not a reliable taxonomic characteristic. However, nutrition is useful in an ecological context to help us understand the adaptations of protists and the roles they play in biological communities. In this ecological context, we can divide protists into three categories: ingestive (animal-like) protists, or protozoa (singular, protozoan); absorptive (funguslike) protists (these have no other general name); and photosynthetic (plantlike) protists, or algae (singular, alga). The term alga refers to relatively simple aquatic photoautotrophs, including some organisms that some biologists include in the plant kingdom. Though commonly used, the terms protozoa and algae have no basis in phylogeny and no significance in taxonomy.

Motility

Most protists are motile, usually having flagella or cilia at some time in their life cycles. It is important to understand that prokaryotic and eukaryotic versions of flagella are not homologous structures. Prokaryotic flagella are attached to the cell surface (see FIGURE 27.7). In contrast, eukaryotic flagella and cilia are extensions of the cytoplasm, with bundles of microtubules covered by the plasma membrane (see FIGURE 7.24). Eukaryotic cilia and flagella have the same basic ultrastructure (the 9 + 2 arrangement of microtubules), but cilia are shorter and more numerous.

Life Cycles

Reproduction and life cycles are highly varied among protists. Mitosis occurs in almost all protists, but there are many variations in the process unknown in other eukaryotes. Some protists are exclusively asexual; others can also reproduce sexually or at least employ the sexual processes of meiosis and syngamy (the union of two gametes), thereby shuffling genes between two individuals that then go on to reproduce asexually. In Chapter 13, you learned about three basic types of sexual life cycles that differ in the timing of meiosis and syngamy (see FIGURE 13.5). All three types are represented among protists, along with some variations that do not quite fit any of the three basic life cycle patterns. However, the haploid stage is the main vegetative (feeding and growing) stage of most protists, with the only diploid cell being the zygote.

At some point in the life cycle of many protists, resistant cells called cysts are formed that can survive harsh conditions. Microfossils resembling the ruptured cysts of some algae are among the oldest remnants of eukaryotic life in the Precambrian era.

Protistan Habitats

Most protists are aquatic organisms. They are found almost anywhere there is water, including damp soil, leaf litter, and other terrestrial habitats that are sufficiently moist. In oceans, ponds, and lakes, many protists are bottom dwellers that attach themselves to rocks and other anchorages or creep through the sand and silt. Protists are also important constituents of plankton (from the Greek planktos, wandering), the communities of organisms, mostly microscopic, that drift passively or swim weakly near the water surface. Phytoplankton (planktonic eukaryotic algae, along with the prokaryotic cyanobacteria) are the bases of most marine and freshwater food webs. Accounting for at least half the photosynthetic production of organic material globally, phytoplankton supports an enormous abundance and diversity of heterotrophic protists, prokaryotes, and animals.

In addition to free-living protists are the many symbionts that inhabit the body fluids, tissues, or cells of hosts. These symbiotic relationships span the continuum from mutualism to parasitism. Some parasitic protists are important pathogens of animals, including many, like the agent of malaria, that cause potentially fatal diseases in humans.

In this introduction to the protists, we have previewed the enormous diversity of these organisms. The one characteristic they do share is that their cells are eukaryotic, as are those of plants, animals, and fungi. Before taking a closer look at the diversity of protists, let's consider the origin of the domain Eukarya from prokaryotic ancestors.





 Endomembranes contributed to larger, more complex cells

The small size and relatively simple construction of a prokaryote confer many advantages but also impose limits on the number of different metabolic activities that can be handled at one time. The relatively small size of the prokaryotic genome limits the number of genes coding for the enzymes that control these activities. This is not to say that prokaryotes are less successful than eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have been evolving and adapting since the dawn of life, and they are the most widespread organisms even today.

In at least some prokaryotic groups, increasing complexity--higher levels of organization with emergent properties--evolved. One trend was the evolution of multicellular prokaryotes, such as some filamentous cyanobacteria, where different cell types are specialized for different functions (see FIGURE 27.8). A second trend was the evolution of complex communities of prokaryotes, where each species benefited from the metabolic specialties of other species. A third trend was the compartmentalization of different functions within single cells, an evolutionary solution that contributed to the origin of eukaryotes.

How did compartmental organization of the eukaryotic cell evolve from the simpler prokaryotic condition? In one process, the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells--the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and related structures--may have evolved from specialized infoldings of the prokaryotic plasma membrane (FIGURE 28.4). Another process, called endosymbiosis, probably led to mitochondria, plastids, and perhaps some of the other features of eukaryotic cells.

Fig 28-4. A model of the origin of eukaryotes.





 Mitochondria and plastids evolved from endosymbiotic bacteria

The hypothesis we just referred to for the origin of the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells fits the traditional Darwinian concept of gradual refinement of existing structures through natural selection. It seems like a reasonable guess that eukaryotes evolved from a single prokaryotic ancestor that gradually accumulated greater structural complexity. But the evidence is now overwhelming that the eukaryotic cell originated from a symbiotic coalition of multiple prokaryotic ancestors, not just one. We'll examine how this merger of organisms gave rise to two key eukaryotic organelles: mitochondria and plastids (the general term for the class of eukaryotic organelles that includes chloroplasts, as well as other types of plastids, both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic).

An idea originated by the early 20th century Russian biologist C. Mereschkovsky and developed extensively by Lynn Margulis, of the University of Massachusetts, the theory of serial endosymbiosis proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were formerly small prokaryotes living within larger cells. The term endosymbiont is used for the cell that lives within another cell, called the host cell. The proposed ancestors of mitochondria were aerobic heterotrophic prokaryotes that became endosymbionts. The proposed ancestors of chloroplasts were photosynthetic prokaryotes that became endosymbionts.

The prokaryotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts probably gained entry to the host cell as undigested prey or internal parasites (see FIGURE 28.4). Such a mechanism suggests an earlier evolution of an endomembrane system and a cytoskeleton that made it possible for the larger cell to engulf the smaller prokaryotes and package them within vesicles. By whatever means the relationships began, it is not hard to imagine the symbiosis eventually becoming mutually beneficial. A heterotrophic host could use nutrients released from photosynthetic endosymbionts. And in a world that was becoming increasingly aerobic, a cell that was itself an anaerobe would have benefited from aerobic endosymbionts that turned the oxygen to advantage. In the process of becoming more interdependent, the host and endosymbionts would have become a single organism, its parts inseparable. All eukaryotes, whether heterotrophic or autotrophic, have mitochondria or genetic remnants of these organelles. However, not all eukaryotes have chloroplasts. Thus, the hypothesis of serial endosymbiosis (a sequence of endosymbiotic events) supposes that mitochondria evolved before chloroplasts.

The evidence supporting an endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria includes the existence of endosymbiotic relationships in the modern world. Another line of evidence is the similarity between bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotes. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria are the appropriate size to be descendants of bacteria. The inner membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria, derived from the membranes of endosymbiotic prokaryotes, according to the endosymbiotic theory, do indeed have several enzymes and transport systems that resemble those found on the plasma membranes of modern prokaryotes. Mitochondria and chloroplasts replicate by a splitting process reminiscent of binary fission in bacteria. Each chloroplast and mitochondrian contains a genome consisting of a single circular DNA molecule not associated with histones or other proteins, as in most prokaryotes. The organelles contain the transfer RNAs, ribosomes, and other equipment needed to transcribe and translate their DNA into proteins. In terms of size, biochemical characteristics, and sensitivity to certain antibiotics, the ribosomes of chloroplasts are more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes than they are to the ribosomes outside the chloroplast in the cytosol of the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondrial ribosomes vary extensively from one group of eukaryotes to another, but they are generally more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes than to their counterparts in the eukaryotic cytoplasm.

A comprehensive theory for the origin of the eukaryotic cell must also account for the evolution of the cytoskeleton, including the 9 + 2 microtubule apparatus of eukaryotic flagella and cilia (see Chapter 7). Some researchers have speculated that eukaryotic flagella and cilia evolved from symbiotic bacteria (see discussion of spirochetes in TABLE 27.3), but the evidence for this is not strong.

Related to the evolution of the eukaryotic flagellum is the origin of mitosis and meiosis, processes unique to eukaryotes that also employ microtubules. Mitosis made it possible to reproduce the large genomes of the eukaryotic nucleus, and the closely related mechanics of meiosis became an essential process in eukaryotic sex. The question of cytoskeleton origin clearly demonstrates how much more researchers have to learn about the genesis of eukaryotic life.





 The eukaryotic cell is a chimera of prokaryotic ancestors

The chimera of Greek mythology was a monster that was part goat, part lion, and part serpent. The eukaryotic cell is a chimera of prokaryotic parts, its mitochondria derived from one type of bacteria, its plastids from another, and its nuclear genome from at least one other prokaryote, the cell that hosted the endosymbiotic ancestors of the organelles. Once a consensus for the endosymbiotic theory developed from an accumulation of evidence, many researchers turned their attention to a search for the closest living prokaryotic relatives of the chimeric eukaryotic cell.

The Ancestors of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

Systematists assessing relationships between organisms as different as modern prokaryotes and eukaryotes must compare molecules, for there are no morphological homologies connecting species so diverse (see Chapter 25). Molecular systematists working on the origin of eukaryotes first focused on the nucleotide sequence of the RNA in the smaller of the two ribosomal subunits. The gene for this small ribosomal subunit RNA (SSU-rRNA, for short) is present in all organisms, making it a good choice for studying the deepest branching in evolutionary history (see Chapter 27). By comparing sequences of SSU-rRNA from various prokaryotes and mitochondria, researchers have determined that the closest prokaryote relatives of mitochondria are the alpha proteobacteria (see TABLE 27.3). The sequences of SSU-rRNA from the plastids of various photosynthetic eukaryotes cluster with the prokaryotes called cyanobacteria. This corroborates other evidence of a relationship between cyanobacteria and plastids, namely that cyanobacteria are the only autotrophic prokaryotes with the water-splitting, oxygenic version of photosynthesis that characterizes chloroplasts and other plastids (see Chapter 27).

Of course, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria have continued to evolve as diverse prokaryotic groups since eukaryotic life began over 2 billion years ago. But somewhere, sometime, in that murky past, cyanobacteria share an ancestor common with the plastids of plants and eukaryotic algae. And proteobacteria share a common ancestor with the mitochondria of all eukaryotes; our own cells depend on the descendants of these bacteria for their ATP supply.

Gene Transfer to the Nucleus

While it is true that plastids and mitochondria contain DNA and the equipment for building proteins, they are not genetically self-sufficient. Some of the proteins within mitochondria and plastids are indeed encoded by the organelles' own DNA. However, the genes for other proteins in the organelles reside in the eukaryotic cell's nucleus. And still other proteins in the organelles are molecular chimeras of polypeptides made in the organelles and polypeptides imported from the cytoplasm, where they are translated from messenger RNA transcribed in the nucleus. An example is the mitochondrial ATP synthase, the protein complex that generates ATP during cellular respiration (see Chapter 9).

If mitochondria and plastids are descendants of bacteria that had their own genomes, then how do we explain the modern collaboration between the genomes of the organelles and nucleus? A reasonable hypothesis is that the endosymbionts transferred some of their DNA to the host cell's genome during the evolutionary transition from a symbiotic community of prokaryotes to an integrated eukaryotic organism. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that the transfer of DNA between modern prokaryotic species is common--by transformation, for example, when a prokaryote takes up DNA from its surroundings and incorporates it into its own genome (see Chapter 18). It is fair to say that the eukaryotic cell, though chimeric in origin, now has only one genome, mostly nuclear, but complemented by DNA that has remained in the mitochondria and plastids.





 Secondary endosymbiosis increased the diversity of algae

We mentioned in our overview of protists that taxonomic groups with plastids--plants and different kinds of algae--are scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes. The diverse algae display various types of plastids that differ in their ultrastructure, as revealed by electron microscopes. For example, the chloroplasts of plants and a protistan group called green algae have envelopes consisting of two membranes (see FIGURE 7.18). In contrast, some algal groups have plastid envelopes with three or four membranes. For example, the plastids of Euglena (see FIGURE 28.3) have a three-membrane envelope. We also mentioned that some algae are closely related to heterotrophic species. For instance, Euglena belongs to a group of protists that also includes flagellated, heterotrophic forms lacking plastids.

How can we explain the diversity of plastids and the phylogenetic discontinuity of photosynthesis among protists? Support is building for the hypothesis that plastids were acquired independently several times during the early evolution of eukaryotes. The plastids of some algal groups, those with envelopes having more than two membranes, were acquired by secondary endosymbiosis. It was by primary endosymbiosis that certain eukaryotes first acquired the ancestors of plastids by engulfing cyanobacteria. Secondary endosymbiosis occurred after a heterotrophic protist engulfed an alga containing plastids--one eukaryote taking in another eukaryote. In FIGURE 28.5 you see these two modes of plastid acquisition, primary and secondary. How does secondary endosymbiosis explain the observation that some algae have plastids with more than two outer membranes? Each endosymbiotic event adds a membrane derived from the vacuole membrane of the host cell that engulfed the endosymbiont.

Fig 28-5. Secondary endosymbiosis and the origin of algal diversity. Algal species ABC in this diagram contains plastids derived from endosymbionts that were eukaryotic algae that in turn contained plastids derived from cyanobacteria.

In most cases of secondary plastid acquisition, the endosymbiont gradually lost most of its parts, except, of course, its plastid, which became a plastid within the host cell. In some algae, however, the secondary endosymbionts retained other remnants of their independent past. Consider, for example, a group of flagellated protists called cryptomonad algae. The plastids of these algae contain a structure called a nucleomorph, a vestige of the nucleus of the eukaryotic ancestor of the plastid. There is also a trace of the endosymbiont's cytoplasm, complete with ribosomes. In fact, the cryptomonad plastid contains two distinct populations of ribosomes: ribosomes of the eukaryotic type derived from those of the algal endosymbiont's cytoplasm, and ribosomes of the bacterial type derived from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont of the secondary endosymbiont. Thus, a cryptomonad is like a box containing a box containing a box. The main nucleus and cytoplasm are derived from the prokaryotic host cell that engulfed the prokaryotic ancestor of mitochondria. The eukaryotic descendant of that cell was a heterotroph that later became photosynthetic by taking in a eukaryotic alga. But that secondary endosymbiont itself acquired its plastid earlier in its evolutionary history by taking in a cyanobacterium. Thus, we can trace the ultimate origin of all plastids to cyanobacteria. But some algae acquired that photosynthetic equipment secondhand (or even thirdhand, in the case of algae containing endosymbionts of endosymbionts of endosymbionts).

Through all of this discussion of the chimeric origin of eukaryotes, we have ignored the ancestry of the host cell that got it all started by engulfing the ancestor of mitochondria. We'll see in the next subsection that the search for that ancestor turned up some surprises that are changing the way biologists think about the tree of life.





 Research on the relationships between the three domains is changing ideas about the deepest branching in the tree of life

Note how the chimeric origin of the eukaryotic cell contrasts with the classical Darwinian view of lineal descent through a "vertical" series of ancestors. The eukaryotic cell evolved by "horizontal" fusions of species from different phylogenetic lineages. If the history of life is represented by an evolutionary tree, then the origin of eukaryotes would be depicted by cross-branches connecting the main branches of the tree. Trees, of course, aren't like that. Our metaphor of an evolutionary tree, still useful for thinking about diversification within certain lineages such as the plant and animal kingdoms, starts to break down when it comes to the origin of eukaryotes and other very early evolutionary episodes. And now, researchers who are dissecting the chimeric makeup of the nuclear genome of eukaryotes may actually uproot the tree of life even more by changing our view of how eukaryotes are related to the two prokaryotic domains, Bacteria and Archaea. The key question is, What was the identity of the host cell that engulfed the ancestors of mitochondria during the origin of eukaryotes?

FIGURE 28.6 reviews the conventional model of how the three domains are related (also see FIGURE 27.2). This tree reflects molecular evidence that archaea are more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to prokaryotes. For example, archaea and eukaryotes have quite similar proteins functioning in the information-processing steps of transcription and translation (see Chapter 27). As such phylogenetic evidence accumulated, the case strengthened for the hypothesis that the host cell in the endosymbiotic origin of eukaryotes was derived from an early archaean.

Fig 28-6. Traditional hypothesis for how the three domains of life are related. Tracing the domains back in time, the two prokaryotic branches converge on "LUCA," the last universal common ancestor. The hypothetical tree also depicts the origin of eukaryotes from an archaean-derived host cell with bacterial endosymbionts.

The hypothesis diagrammed in FIGURE 28.6 predicts that the only DNA of bacterial origin we should find in the nucleus of eukaryotes are genes that were transferred there from the endosymbionts that gave rise to mitochondria and plastids. The rest of the genome should be uniquely eukaryotic or derived from archaeal DNA via the host cell of the endosymbiotic scenario. Thus, systematists were surprised to find that the nuclear genome of eukaryotes includes many DNA sequences of bacterial origin that have nothing to do with the functions of mitochondria or plastids. The traditional diagram for the deepest branching of the tree of life also predicts that bacterial genes migrated only to the eukaryotic lineage, not to the branch giving rise to modern archaea. Another surprise: Modern archaea have many genes of bacterial origin. All three domains--Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya--seem to have genomes that are chimeric mixes of DNA that was transferred across the boundaries of the domains.

Many researchers who are turning up these surprising relationships among the domains' genomes suggest replacing the classical tree shown in FIGURE 28.6 with a weblike phylogeny like the one in FIGURE 28.7. The key departure from the traditional tree is the absence of a single ancestor common to the three domains (the "root" or "trunk" in the metaphor of an evolutionary tree). Instead, this new model has the three domains arising from an ancestral community of primitive cells that swapped DNA promiscuously. This would explain the chimeric nature of genomes in modern representatives of all three domains. Such gene transfer across species lines still occurs among prokaryotes (see Chapter 18). This doesn't seem to be the case for modern eukaryotes. The chimeric makeup of the eukaryotic cell is a vestige of gene transfers and endosymbiotic events that occurred in prokaryotic communities over 2 billion years ago.

Fig 28-7. An alternative hypothesis for how the three domains of life are related. Based on evidence of extensive gene transfer between prokaryotic lineages today and throughout the past, this hypothesis replaces "LUCA" with an ancestral community of primitive cells that swapped genes. The diversity of organisms that evolved from that community consolidated into three main phylo genetic branches, the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. In the case of the endosymbiosis that gave rise to the mitochondria and chloroplasts, whole organisms of different evolutionary branches fused. However, most of the horizontal strands fusing with the vertical branches in this phylogeny symbolize the transfer of genes, not whole organisms, between different lineages.





 The origin of eukaryotes catalyzed a second great wave of diversification

An orchestra can play a greater variety of musical compositions than a violin soloist can. Put simply, increased complexity makes more variations possible. The origin of the eukaryotic cell catalyzed the evolution of much more structural diversity than was possible for the simpler prokaryotic cells. This built on the first great adaptive radiation, the metabolic diversification of the prokaryotes. A third wave of diversification followed the origin of multicellular bodies in several eukaryotic lineages (a topic we will consider near the end of this chapter).

FIGURE 28.8 (p. 554) is a hypothetical phylogeny for some of the major groups of eukaryotes. The diversity ranges from a great variety of unicellular forms to such macroscopic, multicellular groups as brown algae (a seaweed group), plants, fungi, and animals.

Fig 28-8. A tentative phylogeny of eukaryotes. The eukaryotes that are labeled on the branches are grouped into larger clades that are named in the boxes at the top of the tree. The kingdoms Fungi, Animalia, and Plantae have survived from the five-kingdom system of classification, although their boundaries have changed somewhat. Most of the major groups that used to be included in the kingdom Protista are color-coded yellow. Most protistan systematists now assign kingdom status to each of these groups. In fact, the trend is to split some of the more diverse groups, such as Alveolata and Stramenopila, into multiple kingdoms. Thus, we will make no attempt to predict the outcome of future research by ranking the protistan clades into kingdoms and phyla. As we survey the diversity of protists, each group will be introduced with a miniature version of this diagram so that you can place the group into the overall phylogeny of eukaryotes. However, our diagram omits several protistan groups that are not discussed in this chapter. And the tree even omits some protists that are discussed, such as the forams, because their phylogeny is still uncertain.

The clustering of eukaryotic forms into the clades of FIGURE 28.8 is based on comparisons of cell structure, life cycles, and molecules (nucleic acid and protein sequences). The molecular data include SSU-rRNA sequences and amino acid sequences for a few of the proteins of the cytoskeleton--proteins unique to eukaryotes. The protein comparisons have enabled systematists to resolve some classification issues that were not clear from SSU-rRNA data and cell structure.

FIGURE 28.8 brings up the "kingdoms problem" again. If plants, fungi, and animals are designated as kingdoms in this phylogenetic classification of eukaryotes, then each of the other major clades of eukaryotic life probably deserves kingdom status as well. This taxonomic trend was mentioned earlier when we discussed the splitting of the old kingdom Protista into many kingdoms. However, as protistan systematics is still so unsettled, FIGURE 28.8 simply names major clades without committing to a ranking of groups into kingdoms and phyla; any attempt here to specify the number of kingdoms and their names would just make the tree obsolete before this book's ink had time to dry! In fact, some of the best-known protists, such as the single-celled amoebas, are not even included in this tentative phylogeny because it is still so uncertain where they fit into the overall eukaryotic tree.

As tentative as our eukaryotic tree is, we'll use it to organize the survey of protistan diversity that follows.





 Diplomonadida and Parabasala: Diplomonads and parabasalids lack mitochondria

A few protistan groups lack mitochondria. Two of these groups are the diplomonads and the parabasalids. According to what is called the "archaezoa hypothesis," these protists are the modern forms of ancient eukaryotic lineages that evolved before the acquisition of the endosymbiotic bacteria that gave rise to mitochondria. Most protistan systematists have recently rejected that hypothesis based on the discovery of mitochondrial genes in the nuclear genomes of the diplomonads and parabasalids. In other words, the evidence now supports the hypothesis that these protists lost their mitochondria during their evolution from ancestors in which mitochondria were present. However, other details of cell structure combined with data from molecular systematics still place the diplomonads and parabasalids on the phylogenetic branch that diverged earliest in eukaryotic history (see FIGURE 28.8).

The diplomonads have multiple flagella, two separate nuclei, a relatively simple cytoskeleton (compared with other eukaryotes), no plastids, and, as already pointed out, no mitochondria. An infamous example is Giardia lamblia, a parasite that infects the human intestine, causing abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea (FIGURE 28.9). People most often pick up Giardia by drinking water contaminated with human feces containing the parasite in a dormant cyst stage. Drinking such water from what seems like a pristine stream or river can ruin a camping trip. Boiling drinking water kills the cysts.

The parabasalids, another group lacking mitochondria, include the protists called trichomonads. The best known species is Trichomonas vaginalis, a common inhabitant of the vagina of human females. It can proliferate and infect the vaginal lining by overcoming beneficial microbial populations if the normal acidity of the vagina is disturbed. Such infections also occur in the urethras of males, though often without symptoms. Sexual transmission can spread the infection. Note in FIGURE 28.10 that T. vaginalis has both flagella and an undulating membrane, structures that enable these protists to move along the mucus-coated skin within the reproductive and urinary tracts of their human hosts.

 Euglenozoa: The euglenozoa includes both photosynthetic and heterotrophic flagellates

Several protistan groups are equipped with flagella that function in locomotion. Two of these groups of flagellates, the euglenoids and the kinetoplastids, make up the clade labeled Euglenozoa in FIGURE 28.8.

The euglenoids (Euglenophyta, such as Euglena and its close relatives) are characterized by an anterior pocket, or chamber, from which one or two flagella emerge. Paramylon, a glucose polymer that functions as a storage molecule, is also characteristic of euglenoids. Euglena, the organism in FIGURE 28.3, is chiefly autotrophic. However, many euglenoids are mixotrophic or heterotrophic, absorbing organic molecules from their surroundings or engulfing prey by phagocytosis.

The kinetoplastids (Kinetoplastida) have a single large mitochondrion associated with a unique organelle, the kinetoplast, that houses extranuclear DNA. The kinetoplastids are symbiotic, and some are pathogenic to their hosts. For example, species of Trypanosoma cause African sleeping sickness, a human disease that is spread by the bite of the tsetse fly (FIGURE 28.11). Sleeping sickness is a debilitating disease common in parts of Africa. Trypanosomes escape being killed by the host's defenses by being quick-change artists. They alter the molecular structure of their coats frequently, thus preventing immunity from developing in the host.

 Alveolata: The alveolates are unicellular protists with subsurface cavities (alveoli)

Another protistan clade that is emerging from molecular systematics, Alveolata, draws together a group of flagellates (the dinoflagellates), a group of parasites (apicomplexans), and a distinctive group of eukaryotes that move by means of cilia (the ciliates). Alveolates have small membrane-bounded cavities (alveoli) under their cell surfaces. The function of the alveoli is unknown; they may help stabilize the cell surface and regulate the cell's water and ion content.

Dinoflagellata (Dinoflagellates)

Dinoflagellates are abundant components of the vast aquatic pastures of phytoplankton that are suspended near the water surface and provide the foundation of most marine and many freshwater food webs. There are also heterotrophic species of dinoflagellates.

Of the several thousand known dinoflagellate species, most are unicellular, but some are colonial forms. Each dinoflagellate species has a characteristic shape reinforced in some species by internal plates of cellulose (FIGURE 28.12). The action of two flagella in perpendicular grooves in this "armor" produces a spinning movement for which these organisms are named (from the Greek dinos, whirling).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 28-12. A dinoflagellate. Flagellar action spins this toplike form (SEM).

Dinoflagellate blooms--episodes of explosive population growth--cause red tides in coastal waters. These blooms are brownish red or pinkish orange because of the predominant pigments (xanthophylls) in the plastids of dinoflagellates. Toxins produced by some red-tide organisms have resulted in massive invertebrate and fish kills and can be deadly to humans as well.

One especially dangerous dinoflagellate called Pfiesteria piscicida is actually carnivorous. During blooms, its toxin stuns fish, and the dinoflagellates feed on their prey's body fluids. In the past decade, the frequency of Pfiesteria blooms and fish kills have increased in coastal waters of the U.S. mid-Atlantic states, possibly a result of pollution of the water with fertilizers (nitrates and phosphates).

Some dinoflagellates are spectacularly bioluminescent. An ATP-driven chemical reaction gives off light, creating an eerie ocean glow at night when waves, boats, or human swimmers agitate water containing dense populations of the dinoflagellates. A possible function of the bioluminescence: When the surrounding water is agitated by small predators that feed on phytoplankton, the light emitted by the dinoflagellates attracts fish that eat those smaller predators. How would you test this hypothesis?

Some dinoflagellates live as mutualistic symbionts of animals called cnidarians that build coral reefs; the photosynthetic output of these dinoflagellates is the main food source for reef communities.

Apicomplexa (Apicomplexans)

All apicomplexans are parasites of animals. Some cause serious human diseases. The parasites disseminate as tiny infectious cells called sporozoites. As seen with the electron microscope, one end (the apex) of the sporozoite cell contains a complex of organelles specialized for penetrating host cells and tissues; thus the name Apicomplexa. Most apicomplexans have intricate life cycles with both sexual and asexual stages, and these cycles often require two or more different host species for completion. An example is Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria (FIGURE 28.13). The incidence of malaria was greatly diminished in the 1960s by the use of insecticides that reduced populations of Anopheles mosquitoes, which spread the disease, and by drugs that killed the parasites in humans. However, the multiplication of resistant varieties of both the mosquitoes and the Plasmodium species have caused a resurgence of the disease. About 300 million people are now infected in the tropics, and up to 2 million die each year from the disease.

Considerable research on possible malarial vaccines has been carried out, but with little success. Plasmodium is an extremely evasive parasite. It spends most of its time inside human liver and blood cells, hiding from the host's immune system. The problem is compounded by changes in the surface proteins of Plasmodium; the parasite continually changes the "face" that it shows to the infected person's immune system. Recent identification of a gene that seems to confer resistance to chloroquine, an important antimalarial drug, may lead to ways of blocking drug resistance in Plasmodium. Another recent discovery has exciting evolutionary and medical implications. A team of molecular biologists led by Sabine Kohler, at the University of Pennsylvania, found that Plasmodium and several other apicomplexans contain a plastid, now nonphotosynthetic, that an apicomplexan ancestor probably acquired from a green alga by secondary endosymbiosis. Once researchers discover the critical functions the plastids perform for their host cells, it may be possible to develop new antimalarial drugs that target those functions.

Ciliophora (Ciliates)

This diverse group of protists is named for their use of cilia to move and feed (FIGURE 28.14). Most ciliates live as solitary cells in fresh water. In contrast to most flagella, cilia are relatively short. They are associated with a submembrane system of microtubules that may coordinate the movement of the thousands of cilia.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 28-14. Ciliates (all LMs).

Some ciliates are completely covered by rows of cilia, whereas others have their cilia clustered into fewer rows or tufts. The specific arrangements adapt the ciliates for their diverse lifestyles. Some species, for instance, scurry about on leglike structures constructed from many cilia bonded together. Other forms, such as Stentor, have rows of tightly packed cilia that function collectively as locomotor membranelles. Ciliates are among the most complex of all cells.

A unique feature of ciliate genetics is the presence of two types of nuclei, a large macronucleus and usually several tiny micronuclei. The macronucleus has 50 or more copies of the genome. The genes are not distributed in typical chromosomes but are instead packaged into a much larger number of small units, each with hundreds of copies of just a few genes. The macronucleus controls the everyday functions of the cell by synthesizing RNA and is also necessary for asexual reproduction. Ciliates generally reproduce by binary fission, during which the macronucleus elongates and splits, rather than undergoing mitotic division. Some species of Paramecium have from 1 to as many as 80 micronuclei, which do not function in growth, maintenance, and asexual reproduction of the cell but are required for sexual processes that generate genetic variation. The sexual shuffling of genes occurs during the process known as conjugation (FIGURE 28.15). Notice in the diagram that in ciliates, sexual mechanisms of meiosis and syngamy are processes separate from reproduction.

 Stramenopila: The stramenopile clade includes the water molds and the heterokont algae

A diverse protistan clade, Stramenopila includes several heterotrophic groups as well as a variety of photosynthetic protists (algae). The term stramenopila refers to the numerous fine, hairlike projections on the flagella that are characteristic of these organisms (from the Latin stramen, straw, flagellum, and pilos, hair). In most cases, the "hairy" flagellum is paired with a smooth (nonhairy) flagellum. In the life cycles of most stramenopile groups, the only flagellated stages are motile reproductive cells.

Oomycota (Water Molds and Their Relatives)

Oomycotes include the water molds, white rusts, and downy mildews, all examples of heterotrophic stramenopiles that lack chloroplasts. Some of these organisms are unicellular; others consist of hyphae (fine, branching filaments) that are multi-nucleated (coencytic). Hyphae in this group are analogous to the branching filaments (also called hyphae) of true fungi. However, water molds and their relatives typically have cell walls made of cellulose, while the walls of true fungi are made of another polysaccharide, chitin. The diploid condition, which is reduced in true fungi, prevails in the life cycles of most members of Oomycota. Biflagellated cells occur in the life cycles of oomycotes, while almost all true fungi lack flagella. Molecular systematics has confirmed that water molds and other oomycotes are not closely related to fungi. The similar "body plan"--a mass of thin filaments (hyphae)--is an example of convergent evolution. In both the oomycotes and fungi, the filamentous bodies have an extensive surface area, which enhances the absorption of nutrients.

Oomycota means "egg fungi," a reference to the mode of sexual reproduction in water molds. A relatively large egg cell is fertilized by a smaller "sperm nucleus," forming a resistant zygote (FIGURE 28.16).

Fig 28-16. The life cycle of a water mold. Water molds help decompose dead insects, fish, and other animals submerged in fresh water (see the hyphal mass on the goldfish in the inset).

Most water molds are decomposers that grow as cottony masses on dead algae and animals, mainly in fresh water. There are also parasitic water molds, such as those that grow on the skin and gills of fish in ponds or aquariums, but they usually attack only injured tissue.

White rusts and downy mildews generally live on land as parasites of plants. They are dispersed primarily by windblown spores, but they also form flagellated zoospores at some point during their life cycles. One devastating plant pathogen, a downy mildew, threatened the French vineyards in the 1870s. Another oomycote species, Phytophthora infestans, causes late potato blight, which contributed to the Irish famine in the 19th century.

Overview of the Heterokont Algae

The stramenopile taxa with mostly photosynthetic members are collectively called the heterokont algae, with the "hetero" referring to the two different types of flagella ("hairy" and "nonhairy"), which are characteristic of the whole stramenopile group.

The plastids of heterokont algae evolved by secondary endosymbiosis. This explains the three-membrane envelope and the presence of a small amount of eukaryotic cytoplasm within the plastid (see FIGURE 28.5). The probable ancestor of the plastids in heterokont algae was a red alga, its own plastid derived from a cyanobacterium by primary endosymbiosis. The heterokont algae include the diatoms, golden algae, and brown algae.

Bacillariophyta (Diatoms)

Yellow or brown in color, diatoms have unique glasslike walls consisting of hydrated silica embedded in an organic matrix. Each wall is in two parts that overlap like a shoe box and lid (FIGURE 28.17).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 28-17. Diatoms. The glasslike shells consist of two halves that fit like the bottom and lid of a shoe box. Tiny pores in the ornate shells allow for the exchange of gases and other substances between the cell and its environment. During mitosis, each daughter cell keeps half of the parent cell's shell and builds a new complementary half.

Most of the year, diatoms reproduce asexually by mitotic cell divisions, with each daughter cell receiving half of the cell wall of its parent and regenerating a new second half. Cysts are formed by some species as resistant stages. Sexual stages are not common and involve the formation of eggs and sperm; sperm cells are amoeboid or flagellated, depending on the species.

Both freshwater and marine plankton are rich in diatoms; a bucket of water scooped from the surface of the sea may have millions of these microscopic algae. In common with golden algae and brown algae, diatoms store food reserves in the form of a glucose polymer called laminarin. Some diatoms also store food in the form of oil.

Massive accumulations of fossilized diatom walls are major constituents of the sediments known as diatomaceous earth, which is mined for its quality as a filtering medium and for many other uses.

Chrysophyta (Golden Algae)

Golden algae, or chrysophytes (from the Greek chrysos, golden), are named for their color, which results from yellow and brown carotene and xanthophyll accessory pigments. Their cells are typically biflagellated, with both flagella attached near one end of the cell. Many golden algae live among freshwater and marine plankton. Some species are mixotrophic, absorbing dissolved organic compounds or ingesting food particles and bacteria by phagocytosis, which occurs near the base of the flagella. Most golden algae are unicellular, but some, such as the freshwater genus Dinobryon, are colonial (FIGURE 28.18). If cell density reaches a certain high level, many species form resistant cysts that can remain viable for decades.

Fig 28-18. A golden alga. Dinobryon is a freshwater member of this algal group. This species is colonial, but most golden algae are unicellular (LM).

Phaeophyta (Brown Algae)

The largest and most complex algae are brown algae, or phaeophytes (from the Greek phaios, dusky, brown). All are multicellular, and most are marine. Brown algae are especially common along temperate coasts, where the water is cool. They owe their characteristic brown or olive color to accessory pigments in the plastids. The plastid structure and pigment composition of brown algae are homologous to the photosynthetic equipment of golden algae and diatoms.

Many of the eukaryotes commonly called seaweeds are brown algae. Seaweeds are large marine algae, and the largest members of this important ecological group are brown algae. Two other groups, the red algae and green algae, also include seaweeds. We will examine these algal groups after we look at some of the adaptations, human uses, and life cycles of the seaweeds.





 Structural and biochemical adaptations help seaweeds survive and reproduce at the ocean's margins

Seaweeds, along with many animals and other heterotrophs these algae support, inhabit the intertidal and subtidal zones of coastal waters. The intertidal zone presents unique challenges to life. At times it is violently active, churned by waves and wind. Two times each day, at low tide, intertidal seaweeds are exposed to the drying atmosphere and rays of the sun. Twice each day, at high tide, the same seaweeds are submerged. Seaweeds have unique structural and biochemical adaptations that enable them to survive and thrive in this rough-and-tumble environment.

Seaweeds have the most complex multicellular anatomy of all algae. Some even have differentiated tissues and organs that resemble those we find in plants. The similarities evolved independently in the algal and plant lineages and are thus analogous, not homologous. The term thallus (plural, thalli; from the Greek thallos, sprout) is used for a seaweed body that is plantlike, but a thallus lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. A typical seaweed thallus consists of a rootlike holdfast, which anchors the alga, and a stemlike stipe, which supports leaflike blades (FIGURE 28.19). The blades provide most of the surface for photosynthesis. Some brown algae are equipped with floats, which keep the blades near the water surface. Beyond the intertidal zone in deeper waters live the giant seaweeds known as kelps (FIGURE 28.20). The stipes of these brown algae may be as long as 60 m.

Its thallus is well adapted to maintaining a firm foothold in this extreme environment. Postelsia is a brown alga (Phaeophyta).

Fig 28-20. A kelp forest. The great kelp beds of temperate coastal waters provide habitat and food for a variety of organisms, including many species of fish caught by humans. The kelps, brown algae (Phaeophyta), are prodigiously productive. This brown alga, Macrocystis, common along the U.S. Pacific coast, grows to a length of more than 60 m in a single season, the fastest linear growth of any organism. Kelp is a renewable resource reaped by special boats that cut and collect the tops of the algae.

In addition to these structural adaptations of thalli, some seaweeds are also endowed with biochemical adaptations to intertidal and subtidal conditions. For example, their cell walls are composed of cellulose and gel-forming polysaccharides, accounting for the slimy and rubbery feel of many seaweeds. These substances help cushion the thalli against the agitation of the waves.

Seaweeds are an important source of food and other commodities for humans. Coastal people, particularly in Asia, harvest seaweeds for food. For example, in Japan and Korea, the brown alga Laminaria is used in soups (Japanese "kombu"), and the red alga Porphyra is used to wrap sushi (Japanese "nori"). Marine algae are rich in iodine and other essential minerals, but much of their organic material consists of unusual polysaccharides that humans cannot digest, which prevents seaweeds from becoming staple foods. They are used mostly for their rich tastes and unusual textures. The gel-forming substances in their cell walls (algin in brown algae, agar and carageenan in red algae) are extracted in commercial operations. These substances are widely used in the manufacture of thickeners for such processed foods as puddings and salad dressing and as lubricants in oil drilling, and agar is used as the gel-forming base for microbiological culture media.





 Some algae have life cycles with alternating multicellular haploid and diploid generations

A variety of life cycles have evolved among the multicellular brown, red, and green algae. The most complex cycles include an alternation of generations, the alternation of multicellular haploid forms and multicellular diploid forms. (Notice that haploid and diploid conditions alternate in all sexual life cycles--human gametes, for example, are a haploid stage--but the term alternation of generations is reserved for life cycles that include haploid and diploid stages that are both multicellular organisms.) As we will see in Chapter 29, alternation of generations also evolved in the life cycles of all plants.

We can examine the brown alga Laminaria as an example of a complex life cycle with an alternation of generations. The diploid individual is called the sporophyte because it produces reproductive cells called spores (zoospores). The haploid individual is called the gametophyte, which is named for its production of gametes. Notice in FIGURE 28.21 (p. 564) that these two generations alternate--that is, they take turns producing one another. Spores released from the sporophyte develop into gametophytes, which in turn produce gametes. The union of two gametes (fertilization, or syngamy) results in a diploid zygote, which gives rise to a new sporophyte. In the case of Laminaria, the two generations are heteromorphic, meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes are structurally different. Other algal life cycles have an alternation of isomorphic generations, meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes look alike, although they differ in chromosome number.

Fig 28-21. The life cycle of Laminaria: an example of alternation of generations.





 Rhodophyta: Red algae lack flagella

Unlike other eukaryotic algae, red algae (Rhodophyta; from the Greek rhodos, red) have no flagellated stages in their life cycle. They are commonly reddish because of an accessory pigment called phycoerythrin. It belongs to a family of pigments known as phycobilins, also found in cyanobacteria. In fact, the plastids of red algae evolved from cyanobacteria by primary endosymbiosis.

Despite their name, not all rhodophytes are red. Species adapted to different water depths differ in their proportions of accessory pigments. Rhodophytes may be almost black in deep water, bright red at more moderate depths, and greenish in very shallow water because less phycoerythrin masks the green of chlorophyll. Some species lack pigmentation altogether and function heterotrophically as parasites on other red algae.

Red algae are the most abundant large algae in the warm coastal waters of tropical oceans, but there are also some freshwater and soil species. The phycobilins and other accessory pigments allow some species to absorb the light wavelengths (blues and greens) that penetrate down to deep water. A species of red alga has recently been discovered living near the Bahamas at a depth of more than 260 m.

Most red algae are multicellular, and the largest share the designation "seaweeds" with the brown algae, although none of the reds are as big as the giant browns (kelps). The thalli of many red algae are filamentous, often branched and interwoven in delicate lacy patterns (FIGURE 28.22). The base of the thallus is usually differentiated as a simple holdfast.

Fig 28-22. Red algae.

Life cycles are especially diverse among the red algae. Lacking flagella, these algae depend on water currents to bring gametes together for fertilization. Alternation of generations is common in red algae.





 Chlorophyta: Green algae and plants evolved from a common photoautotrophic ancestor

Green algae (chlorophytes and charophyceans in FIGURE 28.8) are named for their grass-green chloroplasts, which are much like those of organisms we traditionally call plants in ultrastructure and pigment composition. Molecular systematics and cellular morphology leave little doubt that green algae and land plants are closely related. In fact, some systematists now advocate inclusion of green algae in an expanded kingdom, the Viridiplantae of FIGURE 28.8 (Latin viridis, green). The common ancestor of green algae and plants probably had chloroplasts derived from cyanobacteria by primary endosymbiosis. Among green algae, those called charophyceans are especially closely related to land plants, and we will discuss them along with the plants in the next chapter. Here our survey of green algae features the chlorophytes (from the Greek chloros, green).

More than 7,000 species of chlorophytes have been identified. Most live in fresh water, but there are also many marine species. Various species of unicellular chlorophytes live as plankton or inhabit damp soil or snow; some species live symbiotically within other eukaryotes, contributing portions of their photosynthetic products to the food supply of the hosts. Chlorophytes are among the algae that live symbiotically with fungi in the mutualistic collectives known as lichens (see FIGURE 31.16).

The simplest chlorophytes are biflagellated unicells such as Chlamydomonas, which resemble the gametes and zoospores of more complex chlorophytes. In addition to unicellular chlorophytes, there are colonial species, as well as many multicellular filamentous forms that contribute to the stringy masses known as pond scum. There are also multicellular chlorophytes, with bodies large and complex enough that marine species qualify as seaweeds along with the large brown algae and red algae.

Larger size and greater complexity have evolved by three different mechanisms: (1) the formation of colonies of individual cells, as seen in species of Volvox (FIGURE 28.23a); (2) the repeated division of nuclei with no cytoplasmic division, as seen in multinucleate filaments of Caulerpa (FIGURE 28.23b); and (3) the formation of true multicellular forms by cell division and cell differentiation, as in Ulva (FIGURE 28.23c).

Fig 28-23. Colonial and multicellular chlorophytes.

Most green algae have complex life histories, with both sexual and asexual reproductive stages. Nearly all reproduce sexually by way of biflagellated gametes having cup-shaped chloroplasts (FIGURE 28.24). The exceptions are the conjugating algae, such as Spirogyra, which produce amoeboid gametes. Alternation of generations evolved in the life cycles of some green algae, including the Ulva of FIGURE 28.23c.

Throughout our survey of protists so far, we have encountered algae, or photosynthetic protists, as members of several different clades, often alongside heterotrophic members of the same clades. Recall from FIGURE 28.5 that different episodes of secondary endosymbiosis account for the diversity of protists with plastids. As a follow-up to that illustration, FIGURE 28.25 (p. 568) places the algal groups we've discussed in the context of their plastids' origins.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 28-25. A hypothetical history of plastids in the photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this simplified model, the host cells in the endosymbiotic episodes are illustrated without their nuclei and mitochondria; here we are concerned only with the origin of the plastids in diverse eukaryotic groups. Note that this "plastid phylogeny" is not the same as a phylogeny of the organisms themselves. The heterokont algae, for example, did not evolve from red algae, but from some heterotrophic protist that engulfed a red alga. Note also that the dinoflagellates have plastids of diverse origins, including via tertiary endosymbiosis of an alga. But the host cells in the various endosymbiotic origins of dinoflagellate plastids were probably closely related as members of the alveolate group.





 A diversity of protists use pseudopodia for movement and feeding

The three groups we discuss in this section represent some of the immense diversity of eukaryotes that move and often feed by means of cellular extensions called pseudopodia. Most of these organisms are heterotrophs that actively seek and consume bacteria, other protists, and detritus (dead organic matter). There are also symbiotic species, including some parasites that cause human disease. We discuss these three groups together only for convenience. Little is known about their phylogeny, although it is clear that they represent several distinct eukaryotic lineages. Because of taxonomic uncertainties, we have not included these protists on the phylogenetic tree shown in FIGURE 28.8.

Rhizopods, more often called amoebas, are all unicellular and use pseudopodia to move and to feed. You may have observed their mode of motility in Amoeba proteus in the laboratory (see FIGURE 28.1a). Pseudopodia may bulge from virtually anywhere on the cell surface. When an amoeba moves, it extends a pseudopodium and anchors its tip, and then more cytoplasm streams into the pseudopodium (rhizopoda means "rootlike feet"). The cytoskeleton, consisting of microtubules and microfilaments, functions in amoeboid movement (see FIGURE 7.27b). Pseudopodial activity may appear chaotic, but in fact amoebas show directed movement as they creep toward a food source (FIGURE 28.26). Some amoebas live inside a protein shell that they secrete. Pseudopodia extend outward through an opening in the shell, which in some species is coated with fine sand grains.

Fig 28-26. Use of pseudopodia for feeding. In this series of images selected from a video, an Amoeba cell uses its pseudopodia to approach and then engulf its prey, a ciliate. Phagocytosis enables Amoeba to take in the ciliate and package it in a food vacuole, which will fuse with lysosomes containing digestive enzymes (see FIGURE 7.13).

Amoebas inhabit both freshwater and marine environments and are also abundant in soils. The majority of amoebas are free-living, but some are important parasites, including Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery in humans. These organisms spread via contaminated drinking water, food, or eating utensils.

Actinopoda (Heliozoans and Radiolarians)

Actinopod means "ray foot," a reference to the slender pseudopodia called axopodia that radiate from these exceptionally beautiful protists (FIGURE 28.27). Each axopodium is reinforced by a bundle of microtubules covered by a thin layer of cytoplasm. Most actinopods are planktonic, and their projections place an extensive area of cellular surface in contact with the surrounding water, helping the organisms float and feed. Smaller protists and other microorganisms stick to the axopodia and are phagocytized by the thin layer of cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic streaming then carries the engulfed prey into the main part of the cell.

Fig 28-27. Actinopods.

Most heliozoans ("sun animals") live in fresh water. Heliozoan skeletons consist of siliceous (glassy) or chitinous unfused plates. The term radiolarian refers to several groups of mostly marine actinopods with skeletons fused into one delicate piece, most commonly made of silica. After actinopods die, their skeletons settle to the seafloor, where they have accumulated as an ooze that is hundreds of meters thick in some locations.

Foraminifera (Forams)

Foraminiferans, or forams, are almost all marine. Most species live in the sand or attach themselves to rocks and algae, but some are also abundant in plankton. Foraminiferans are named for their porous shells (from the Latin foramen, little hole, and ferre, to bear). The shells are generally multichambered and consist of organic material hardened with calcium carbonate. Strands of cytoplasm (pseudopodia) extend through the pores, functioning in swimming, shell formation, and feeding (FIGURE 28.28). Many forams also derive nourishment from the photosynthesis of symbiotic algae that live within the shells.

Fig 28-28. Foraminiferan. Globigerina has a snail-like shell. The largest forams, though single-celled, grow to diameters of several centimeters. The calcium carbonate shells of these protists have left an excellent fossil record in limestone sediments (LM).

Ninety percent of all identified species of forams are fossils. Along with the calcareous remains of other protists, the fossilized shells of forams are components of marine sediments, including sedimentary rocks that are now land formations. Foram fossils are excellent markers for correlating the ages of sedimentary rocks in different parts of the world.





 Mycetozoa: Slime molds have structural adaptations and life cycles that enhance their ecological roles as decomposers

Mycetozoa translates as "fungus animals," though these protists are neither fungi nor animals. The common name, slime molds, reinforces the misconception that these organisms are true fungi. But any resemblance to fungi is analogous, not homologous--an evolutionary convergence of adaptations for decomposing leaf litter and other organic refuse. In fact, if we were classifying protists strictly on the basis of their modes of motility, it would make sense to group the slime molds with the amoebas. Slime molds use pseudopodia for movement and feeding. And slime molds may in fact be phylogenetically close to some of the other amoeboid protists, especially forms such as Amoeba. But systematists are now nearing a consensus that slime molds represent a distinct eukaryotic kingdom, Mycetozoa. And a comparison of protein sequences places the slime molds relatively close to the fungi and animals in the eukaryotic tree (see FIGURE 28.8).

We will see that slime molds have structures that maximize exposure to their food sources, as well as complex life cycles that contribute to survival in changing habitats and facilitate dispersal to new food sources. Mycetozoa consists of two main groups: the plasmodial slime molds and the cellular slime molds.

Myxogastrida (Plasmodial Slime Molds)

The plasmodial slime molds, or myxogastrids, are more attractive than their common name implies. Many species are brightly pigmented, usually yellow or orange, but all are heterotrophic. The feeding stage of the life cycle is an amoeboid mass called a plasmodium, which may grow to a diameter of several centimeters (FIGURE 28.29). Large as it is, the plasmodium is not multicellular; it is a single mass of cytoplasm that is undivided by membranes and that contains many nuclei. This "supercell" results from mitotic divisions of the nuclei which are not followed by cytokinesis, the division of cytoplasm. In most species, the nuclei of the plasmodium are diploid and divisions are synchronous, with each of thousands of nuclei going through each phase of mitosis at the same time. Because of this characteristic, plasmodial slime molds have been used to study the molecular details of the cell cycle.

Fig 28-29. The life cycle of a plasmodial slime mold, such as Physarum.

Within the fine channels of the plasmodium, cytoplasm streams first one way, then the other, in pulsing flows that are beautiful to watch through a microscope. The cytoplasmic streaming apparently helps distribute nutrients and oxygen. The plasmodium engulfs food particles by phagocytosis as it grows by extending pseudopodia through moist soil, leaf mulch, or rotting logs. If the habitat of a slime mold begins to dry up or there is no food left, the plasmodium ceases growth and differentiates into a stage of the life cycle that functions in sexual reproduction.

Dictyostelida (Cellular Slime Molds)

Cellular slime molds, or dictyostelids, pose a semantic question about what it means to be an individual organism. Although the feeding stage of the life cycle consists of solitary cells that function individually, when food is depleted the cells form an aggregate that functions as a unit (FIGURE 28.30, p. 572). Though the mass of cells resembles a plasmodial slime mold, the important distinction is that the cells of a cellular slime mold maintain their identity and remain separated by their membranes.

Fig 28-30. The life cycle of a cellular slime mold (Dictyostelium).

Cellular slime molds also differ from plasmodial slime molds in being haploid organisms (only the zygote is diploid), whereas the diploid condition predominates in the life cycles of most plasmodial slime molds (compare FIGURES 28.29 and 28.30). Cellular slime molds have fruiting bodies that function in asexual reproduction. Also, most cellular slime molds have no flagellated stages.

This completes our survey of diversity and phylogenetic relationships among the eukaryotes traditionally classified as protists. We complete this chapter with a brief discussion of the origins of multicellularity.





 Multicellularity originated independently many times

We have seen that the origin of eukaryotes ignited an explosion of biological diversification; unicellular eukaryotes are much more diverse in structure than the simpler prokaryotes. The evolution of multicellular bodies broke through another threshold in structural organization and provided the stock for new waves of evolutionary diversification. Multicellularity evolved several times among early eukaryotes, with diverse multicellular algae such as seaweeds as examples of the results. The evolution of multicellularity also gave rise to plants, fungi, and animals, and we will discuss the origins of those kingdoms in the following chapters.

When you view a lush landscape, such as the Tasmanian forest scene in the photo above, it is difficult to picture the land without any macroscopic organisms. But that is how we must imagine Earth for almost the first 90%  of the time life has existed. Life was cradled in the seas and ponds, and there it evolved in confinement for 3 billion years. Paleobiologists have discovered fossils of cyanobacteria that coated moist soil about 1.2 billion years ago, but the long evolutionary pilgrimage of more complex organisms onto land did not begin until about 500 million years ago. The terrestrial communities founded by plants transformed the biosphere. Consider, for example, that humans would not exist had it not been for the chain of evolutionary events that began when certain descendants of green algae first colonized land.

The evolutionary history of the plant kingdom is a story of adaptation to changing terrestrial conditions. That is the historical context in which this chapter and the next survey the current diversity of plants and trace their origins.





AN OVERVIEW OF LAND PLANT EVOLUTION

 

 Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants



 

 Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants



 

 Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae



More than 280,000 species of plants inhabit Earth today. Though some species, such as sea grasses, have returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution, most plants live in terrestrial environments, such as deserts, grasslands, and forests. For now, we will refer to all of these organisms as land plants, even those that are now aquatic, to distinguish them from the algae we discussed as photosynthetic protists in Chapter 28. But land plants did indeed evolve from certain green algae called charophyceans, and we will explore this phylogenetic connection later in the chapter. This section introduces the diversity of modern land plants in the context of their terrestrial adaptations.

THE ORIGIN OF VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors



 

 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago



You learned earlier in the chapter that modern vascular plants include the ferns and related plants (pteridophytes), gymnosperms, and flowering plants (angiosperms). And recall that vascular plants are equipped with food-transporting phloem as well as water-conducting xylem tissue with lignified cells. Vascular plants also differ from bryophytes in having a dominant sporophyte generation and branched sporophytes that become independent of parental gametophytes. Pteridophytes are described as seedless vascular plants because, unlike gymnosperms and angiosperms, they do not produce seeds. The first vascular plants were seedless (see FIGURE 29.1).





PTERIDOPHYTES: SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS

 

 Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves



 

 A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants



 

 Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants



 

 Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period



The two phyla of seedless vascular plants represented in the modern flora are the phylum Lycophyta (lycophytes) and phylum Pterophyta (ferns, whisk ferns, and horsetails). These two phyla probably had separate origins from different ancestors among the early vascular plants. Thus, the term "pteridophyte" is an informal one for all seedless vascular plants, while "Pterophyta" is the formal name for one seedless plant phylum, the ferns and their relatives. FIGURE 29.21 illustrates examples of pteridophytes.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-21. Examples of pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). The phyla Lycophyta and Pterophyta probably evolved from different ancient vascular plants. Based on recent evidence that whisk ferns, horsetails, and ferns make up a monophyletic group of seedless vascular plants, many plant systematists now place them all in the single phylum Pterophyta. All of the plants illustrated here are sporophytes, the dominant forms in the life cycles of all vascular plants.





 Evolutionary adaptations to terrestrial living characterize the four main groups of land plants

There are four main groups of land plants: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. The most common bryophytes are the mosses. The pteridophytes include the ferns. Pines and other conifers (cone-bearing plants) are the most familiar gymnosperms. The angiosperms are the flowering plants. Studying these four plant groups provides perspective for understanding the history of life in general, since each plant group originated at a distinct time in Earth's past.

Mosses and other bryophytes are distinguished from algae by several features derived during evolutionary adaptation to living on land. Many of these adaptations are reproductive. For example, when bryophytes and all other land plants reproduce, the offspring develop from multicellular embryos that remain attached to the "mother" plant, which protects and nourishes the embryos.

Additional adaptations distinguish the other major groups of land plants from the bryophytes. An example is the vascular tissue that evolved in an ancestor common to pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. This derived character and others unite these three plant groups in a clade known as the vascular plants (see Chapter 25 to review derived homologies and cladistics). In vascular tissue, cells are joined into tubes that transport water and nutrients throughout the plant body. Most bryophytes lack vascular tissue and hence are sometimes referred to as "nonvascular plants," in contrast to the vascular plants. This distinction is not entirely accurate, however, for water-conducting tubes are present in some bryophytes. (Later, we will examine some derived features that more accurately mark the "vascular plant" clade.)

Among vascular plants, ferns and other pteridophytes are sometimes called seedless plants because there is no seed stage in their life cycles. In contrast, gymnosperms and angiosperms are seed plants. The evolution of the seed in an ancestor common to gymnosperms and angiosperms added an adaptation that facilitated reproduction on land.

A seed consists of a plant embryo packaged along with a food supply within a protective coat. The first vascular plants with seeds evolved about 360 million years ago, near the end of the Devonian period. Their seeds were not enclosed in any specialized chambers. These early seed plants gave rise to the diversity of present-day gymnosperms (from the Greek gymnos, naked, and sperma, seed), including the conifers.

The evolution of flowers led to further diversification of plants beginning in the early Cretaceous period about 130 million years ago. The flower is a complex reproductive structure that bears seeds within protective chambers called ovaries. This contrasts with the bearing of naked seeds by gymnosperms. The great majority of modern-day plant species are flowering plants, or angiosperms (from the Greek angion, container, and sperma, seed).

Thus, we can trace the bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms of today to four great evolutionary episodes in the history of land plants: the origin of bryophytes from algal ancestors; the origin and diversification of vascular plants; the origin of seeds; and the evolution of flowers. The hypothetical phylogeny in FIGURE 29.1 places the phyla of land plants in this evolutionary context. The taxonomic scheme we'll use in this chapter and the next recognizes a total of ten plant phyla (TABLE 29.1). Before we take a closer look at these diverse plant phyla, let's distinguish land plants from other photosynthetic organisms and then continue our exploration of the terrestrial adaptations that made it possible for plants to colonize land.

 Charophyceans are the green algae most closely related to land plants

How can we define land plants? What features do bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms have in common that distinguish them from other organisms? Plants are multicellular, eukaryotic, photosynthetic autotrophs. However, red seaweeds and brown seaweeds also fit this description (see Chapter 28). Cell walls made of cellulose and the presence of chlorophylls a and b within chloroplasts are often cited as defining characteristics of plants. But cellulose walls are also present in several algal groups, including dinoflagellates and brown algae. And even those green algae that are not closely related to land plants have chloroplasts with both chlorophylls a and b, as do the euglenoids and some dinoflagellates. So we must look to other features to distinguish land plants from algae.

An electron microscopic view of cells reveals two key ultrastructural features that land plants share only with the green algae that are their closest relatives, the algal group called the charophyceans (FIGURE 29.2). First, the plasma membranes of land plants and charophyceans are equipped with rose-shaped arrays of proteins that synthesize the cellulose microfibrils of the cell walls. These rosette cellulose-synthesizing complexes contrast with the linear arrays of cellulose-producing proteins characteristic of noncharophycean algae. This distinction suggests that the cellulose walls of an ancestor common to charophyceans and land plants evolved independently of the cellulose walls of other algae, including most green algae (except charophyceans).

Fig 29-2. Charophyceans, closest algal relatives of the plant kingdom.

A second derived homology in charophyceans and land plants is a match in the enzymes contained within the organelles called peroxisomes, which are often closely associated with chloroplasts (see FIGURE 7.19). These peroxisome enzymes help minimize the loss of organic product due to photorespiration (see Chapter 10). Except for the charophyceans, algal peroxisomes lack these enzymes.

Two additional derived homologies link land plants to the charophycean algae. In those land plants that have flagellated sperm cells, the structure of the sperm closely resembles the sperm of charophyceans. And certain details of cell division are common only to land plants and the most complex of the charophycean algae, such as Chara and Coleochaete, shown in FIGURE 29.2. For example, the synthesis of new cross-walls (cell plates) during cell division involves the formation of a phragmoplast, an alignment of cytoskeletal elements and Golgi-derived vesicles across the midline of the dividing cell (see FIGURE 12.9).

Clearly, we are starting to build a case for a close relationship between charophycean algae and land plants, and we will strengthen our case when we explore the origin of land plants later in the chapter. But for now we search for features unique to land plants--characteristics that distinguish land plants from their closest relatives--for those are the plant features most likely to be associated with terrestrial adaptation.





 Several terrestrial adaptations distinguish land plants from charophycean algae

Several characteristics are common to all four land plant groups--bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms--but are absent in even their closest algal relatives, the charophyceans. Here we'll examine five derived characters unique to land plants.

Apical Meristems, Producers of a Plant's Tissues

In terrestrial habitats, the resources that a photosynthetic organism needs are found in two very different places. Light and carbon dioxide are mainly available aboveground; water and mineral nutrients are found mainly in the soil. Thus, the complex bodies of plants show varying degrees of structural specialization for subterranean and aerial organs--roots and leaf-bearing shoots, respectively, in most plants.

Though plants cannot move from place to place, the elongation and branching of their shoots and roots maximize their exposure to environmental resources. This growth in length is sustained throughout the life of a plant by the activity of apical meristems, localized regions of cell division at the tips of shoots and roots (FIGURE 29.3). Cells produced by these meristems differentiate into the plant's various tissues, including a surface epidermis that protects the body and several types of internal tissues. Shoot meristems also generate leaves in most plants.

Multicellular, Dependent Embryos

Multicellular plant embryos develop from zygotes that are retained within tissues of the female parent (FIGURE 29.4). The parental tissues provide the developing embryo with nutrients, such as sugars and amino acids. The embryo has specialized placental transfer cells, sometimes present in the adjacent maternal tissue as well, which enhance the transfer of nutrients from parent to embryo (FIGURE 29.5). This interface is analogous to the nutrient-transferring embryo-mother interface of eutherian (placental) mammals. Land plants are also known as embryophytes, a distinction that recognizes multicellular, dependent embryos as a derived characteristic common to the land plant clade.

Alternation of Generations

During the life cycles of all land plants, two multicellular body forms alternate, each form producing the other. This type of reproductive cycle, called alternation of generations, also evolved in various groups of algae (see FIGURE 28.24). However, alternation of generations does not occur in the charophyceans, the algae most closely related to land plants. We can infer from this observation that alternation of generations evolved independently as a derived characteristic of land plants that was not present in the ancestor common to land plants and charophyceans.

The two multicellular body forms that alternate in the life cycles of land plants are the gametophyte and sporophyte generations. The cells of the gametophyte are haploid, meaning that they have a single set of chromosomes (see Chapter 13). The gametophyte is named for its production of gametes--eggs and sperm. Fusion of eggs and sperm during the process of fertilization forms diploid zygotes. Mitotic division of the zygote produces the multicellular sporophyte. Thus, the cells of a sporophyte are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, one set contributed by each gamete. Meiosis in a mature sporophyte produces haploid reproductive cells called spores (hence the name sporophyte). A spore is a reproductive cell that can develop into a new organism without fusing with another cell (in contrast to gametes, which cannot develop directly into a multicellular organism; they must first fuse to form zygotes). Mitotic division of a plant spore produces a new multicellular gametophyte. And so the alternation of generations continues, sporophytes producing spores that develop into gametophytes, and gametophytes producing gametes that unite to form the zygotes that develop into sporophytes (FIGURE 29.6).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-6. Alternation of generations: a generalized scheme.

Don't confuse alternation of generations with the more general occurrence of haploid and diploid stages in the life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, including animals (see FIGURE 13.4). In humans, for example, meiosis in the gonads (ovaries and testes) produces haploid gametes, which unite to form diploid zygotes. In this case, the only haploid stage in the life cycle is the gamete, which is single-celled. What distinguishes alternation of generations as a special type of haploid  diploid sexual cycle is that both stages are represented by multicellular bodies.

In some algae with alternation of generations, the multicellular sporophyte and gametophyte look alike to the unaided eye, though microscopic examination would reveal the difference in chromosome count. However, in other algal groups and all land plants, the sporophyte and gametophyte generations are very different in their morphology.

The relative size and complexity of the sporophyte and gametophyte depend on the plant group. In bryophytes, the gametophyte is the "dominant" generation--that is, the organism that is larger and more conspicuous. In contrast, the sporophyte form is the dominant generation in the life cycles of pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. For example, the fern plant most of us are familiar with--the plant with the fronds as leaves--is the diploid sporophyte. The gametophyte is a tiny plant on the forest floor.

Walled Spores Produced in Sporangia

Plant spores are haploid reproductive cells that have the potential to grow into multicellular, haploid gametophytes by mitosis (see FIGURE 29.6). A polymer called sporopollenin, the most durable organic material known, makes the walls of plant spores very tough and resistant to harsh environments (FIGURE 29.7). This chemical adaptation makes it possible for wind-carried spores to disperse through dry air without harm. All four major plant groups produce spores.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-7. A fern spore (LM).

Multicellular organs called sporangia (singular, sporangium), found on the sporophyte generation of a plant, produce the spores (FIGURE 29.8). Within a sporangium, spore mother cells undergo meiosis and generate the haploid spores. The outer tissues of the sporangium protect developing spores until they are ready to be released into the air.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-8. Sporangium of a hornwort (a bryophyte) sporophyte (LM).

Sporangia and resistant spores with sporopollenin-enriched walls are key terrestrial adaptations of land plants. Although the charophyceans produce spores, these algae lack multicellular sporangia, and the flagellated, water-dispersed spores lack sporopollenin.

Multicellular Gametangia

The gametophyte forms of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and gymnosperms all produce their gametes within multicellular organs called gametangia (FIGURE 29.9). The female gametangia are called archegonia (singular, archegonium). Each archegonium is a vase-shaped organ that produces a single egg cell and retains the egg within the base of the organ. Male gametangia, called antheridia, produce many sperm cells that are released to the environment when mature. The sperm cells of bryophytes, pteridophytes, and some gymnosperms bear flagella and swim through water droplets or water films to eggs. Eggs are fertilized within archegonia, where the zygote begins to develop into an embryo.

Other Terrestrial Adaptations Common to Many Land Plants

In addition to the characteristics we have discussed so far that distinguish the land plant clade from charophycean algae, most plants have additional terrestrial adaptations. These include adaptations for acquiring, transporting, and conserving water; adaptations for reducing the harmful effects of UV radiation, which is much more intense on land than in aquatic habitats; and adaptations for repelling terrestrial herbivores and resisting pathogens.

Adaptations for Water Conservation. The epidermis (outer cell layers) of leaves and other aerial parts of most land plants is coated with a cuticle, a layer consisting of polymers called polyesters and waxes (FIGURE 29.10). The cuticle helps protect the plant from microbial attack, and its waxy nature acts as waterproofing that helps prevent excessive water loss from the aboveground plant organs.

Fig 29-10. Cuticle of a stem from Psilotum (a pteridophyte). The yellow "glow" on the surface is caused by fluorescence of the cuticle's waxy chemicals when they are illuminated with ultraviolet light in a special type of light microscope.

The epidermis of leaves and other photosynthetic organs has pores called stomata (singular, stoma) that support photosynthesis by allowing the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the outside air and the leaf interior (see FIGURE 10.2). Stomata are also the main avenues by which water exits the leaves by evaporation. Changes in the shapes of the cells that border the stomata can close the pores to minimize water loss in hot, dry conditions.

Adaptations for Water Transport. Except for bryophytes, land plants have true roots, stems, and leaves, which are defined by the presence of vascular tissues. The two types of tissues that conduct materials in the plant's vascular system are xylem and phloem (FIGURE 29.11). Tube-shaped cells in the xylem carry water and minerals up from roots. These water-conducting cells are actually dead, with only their walls remaining to provide a system of microscopic water pipes. Phloem is a living tissue with nutrient-conducting cells arranged into tubes that distribute sugars, amino acids, and other organic products throughout the plant.

Secondary Compounds as Terrestrial Adaptations. Land plants produce many unique molecules called secondary compounds. They are so named because they are products of "secondary" metabolic pathways, side branches off the primary metabolic pathways that produce lipids, carbohydrates, and the other compounds common to all organisms.

Examples of secondary compounds in plants are alkaloids, terpenes, tannins, and phenolics such as Flavonoids. Various alkaloids, terpenes, and tannins have bitter tastes, strong odors, or toxic effects that help defend land plants against herbivorous animals. Flavonoids absorb harmful UV radiation, and some of these compounds also act as signals that function in symbiotic relationships with beneficial soil microbes (see FIGURE 37.13). Some phenolics deter attack by pathogenic microbes. Other phenolics play key structural roles in land plants. For example, the phenolic polymer called lignin hardens the cell walls of "woody" tissues in vascular plants, supporting even the tallest of trees.

Humans have found many uses, including medicinal applications, for secondary compounds extracted from plants. Just one example is the alkaloid quinine, used to help prevent malaria.

Now that we have examined many terrestrial adaptations that define land plants, let's take a closer look at how these descendants of aquatic algae colonized land.





 Land plants evolved from charophycean algae over 500 million years ago





Let's review the evidence for a phylogenetic connection between land plants and green algae, especially the charophyceans:

Homologous chloroplasts. The algal plastids most like plant chloroplasts are those of green algae and algal groups such as euglenoids, which acquired green algae as secondary endosymbionts (see FIGURE 28.25). The similarities include chlorophyll b and beta-carotene as accessory pigments and thylakoids stacked as grana. Comparisons of chloroplast DNA place the charophyceans as the green algae most closely related to land plants.

Homologous cellulose walls. Though cellulose walls are found in a diversity of algae, the walls of charophyceans are the most plantlike, with cellulose making up 20-26%  of the wall material in both plants and charophyceans. The cellulose-manufacturing rosettes found only in the plasma membranes of charophyceans and land plants are further evidence of cell wall homology.

Homologous Peroxisomes. Charophyceans are the only algae with their anti-photorespiration enzymes packaged in peroxisomes, as they are in plants.

Phragmoplasts. These assemblies occur during cell division only in plants and charophyceans.

Homologous sperm. Many plants have flagellated sperm, which match charophycean sperm closely in ultrastructure.

Molecular systematics. In addition to comparing the chloroplast DNA of charophyceans and plants, molecular systematists have also compared key nuclear genes, such as those for ribosomal RNA and cytoskeletal proteins. The results support all the other evidence connecting charophyceans and plants to a common ancestor and point especially to the most complex charophyceans, such as Chara and Coleochaete (see FIGURE 29.2) as the algae most closely related to plants. However, it is important to understand that modern Chara and Coleochaete are not the ancestors of plants.

Fossils place plants on land over 500 million years ago. The oldest known traces of land plants are encased in mid-Cambrian rocks about 550 million years old. They are microscopic fossils of what paleobotanists interpret to be plant spores. Fossilized plant spores are plentiful in mid-Ordovician (460-million-year-old) deposits from around the world, suggesting that by then plants were abundant and widespread. Some of these fossilized spores occur in aggregates of four, which is the way some modern bryophytes release their spores. The tough walls of sporopollenin explain why spores are the plant structures most likely to leave a fossil record. However, fossilized spores are sometimes associated with scraps of tissue that may represent the remains of the sporophytes that produced the spores (FIGURE 29.12).

 Alternation of generations in plants may have originated by delayed meiosis

The charophyceans Chara and Coleochaete are haploid organisms. There is no sporophyte generation, though these algae do retain and seem to nourish zygotes on the parental bodies, as do the gametophytes of land plants. The main difference is that the zygote of a charophycean undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores, while the zygote of a plant undergoes mitosis to produce a multicellular sporophyte, which in turn produces haploid spores by meiosis. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis for the origin of plant sporophytes is that genetic change (mutations) in an ancestral charophycean caused a delay in meiosis until one or more mitotic divisions of the zygote had occurred (FIGURE 29.13). The result would be a multicellular, diploid sporophyte. This would increase the number of cells that undergo meiosis and thus increase the number of spores produced per zygote. Some botanists speculate that such an evolutionary breakthrough was an important adaptation for maximizing the output of sexual reproduction from each zygote on land, where a shortage of water decreased the probability of swimming sperm fertilizing eggs.

Fig 29-13. A hypothetical mechanism for the origin of alternation of generations in the ancestor of plants. Meiosis in a multicellular sporophyte, rather than direct meiosis by the zygote, would increase the number of haploid offspring (gametophytes) possible from each sexual union of sperm and ovum.





 Adaptations to shallow water preadapted plants for living on land

Many species of charophycean algae inhabit shallow waters around the edges of ponds and lakes, where they are subject to occasional drying. In such environments, natural selection favors individual algae that can survive through periods when they are not completely submerged in water. A layer of sporopollenin prevents exposed charophycean zygotes from drying out until they are in water again. This chemical adaptation may have been the precursor to the tough spore walls so important to the terrestrial survival of plants. Such adaptations accumulated by at least one population of charophyceans enabled their descendants--the first plants--to live permanently above the waterline. The evolutionary novelties of these first land plants opened an expanse of terrestrial habitat previously occupied only by films of bacteria. The new frontier was spacious, the bright sunlight was unfiltered by water and algae, the atmosphere had an abundance of carbon dioxide, the soil was rich in mineral nutrients, and, at least at first, there were relatively few herbivores and pathogens. But these environmental benefits only became available with the evolution of the adaptations that enable plants to survive and reproduce on land, a very different place than the aquatic habitats of the ancestral algae.





 Plant taxonomists are reevaluating the boundaries of the plant kingdom

From our chapters on prokaryotes and protists (see Chapters 27 and 28), you are already aware that there is a revolution under way in how biologists view taxonomy as an outcome of phylogenetic analysis. That taxonomic turmoil also applies to the plant kingdom. Plant taxonomists are combining molecular systematics with cladistic analysis of the molecular data, as well as data from comparing the morphology, life cycles, and cell ultrastructure of organisms, to reevaluate the classification of plants. One international initiative, called "deep green," is focusing on the deepest phylogenetic branching within the plant kingdom to identify and name the major plant clades (monophyletic groups). For the most part, these clades correspond to the ten phyla we will survey in these chapters on plant diversity.

Even "deeper" down the phylogenetic tree of plants is the branching of the whole land plant clade from its algal relatives. Because a phylogenetic tree consists of clades nested within clades, a debate about where to draw boundaries in a hierarchical taxonomy is inevitable. In particular, which clades do we want to include in a plant kingdom?

FIGURE 29.14 contrasts three versions of the plant kingdom. The traditional one equates the plant kingdom with the clade of embryophytes, or plants with embryos--what we have been calling land plants: bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. But some plant biologists now argue that the boundaries of the plant kingdom should be expanded to include the green algae most closely related to plants--the charophyceans and a few related groups. Kingdom Streptophyta is the name that has been proposed for this version of a plant kingdom. And an even broader definition of plants includes chlorophytes (the noncharophycean green algae) in a kingdom Viridiplantae (see Chapter 28). Exercising caution while the experts continue to debate, this text adopts the traditional embryophyte definition of the plant kingdom, and we'll use kingdom Plantae as the formal name for the taxon.

 The plant kingdom is monophyletic

As we begin our survey of modern plants with bryophytes in the next section, remember that the past is the key to the present. Continue to think about the problems and opportunities facing organisms that began living on land. In keeping with this theme of evolution, we will compare the life cycles of different plant phyla. It is not important for you to memorize the details of these life cycles. What is important is to view these diverse life cycles as variations of a common ancestral cycle of alternation of generations. The plant kingdom is monophyletic, meaning that it is derived from a common ancestor (see Chapter 25). Thus, we can interpret the differences we will observe in the life cycles as special reproductive adaptations of the various plant phyla as they diversified from the first plants. In the study of plants, as in the study of all life, an evolutionary perspective connects what would otherwise be an overwhelming collection of seemingly unrelated facts.





 The three phyla of bryophytes are mosses, liverworts, and hornworts





Bryophytes are represented today by three separate phyla: phylum Hepatophyta, commonly called liverworts; phylum Anthocerophyta (hornworts); and phylum Bryophyta (mosses) (FIGURE 29.15). The suffix wort is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "herb," and liverworts and hornworts are indeed small herbaceous (nonwoody) plants named for their shapes. Mosses are the most familiar bryophytes. But some organisms commonly known as "mosses" are not really mosses or even bryophytes; these include Irish moss (a red seaweed), reindeer moss (a lichen), club mosses (pteridophytes), and Spanish moss (a flowering plant).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-15. Bryophytes.

Note that the terms Bryophyta and bryophyte are not synonymous. Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for a certain phylum, the mosses. The term bryophyte refers informally to all the nonvascular plants--the phyla Hepatophyta, Anthocerophyta, and Bryophyta. These diverse bryophytes are not a monophyletic grouping. Gene sequence data, comparative cell structure, and other evidence indicate that liverworts, hornworts, and mosses diverged independently early in plant evolution, before the origin of vascular plants (see FIGURE 29.1). And as noted earlier, fossil evidence supports the hypothesis that bryophytes were the earliest plants. Though the identity of the modern bryophyte group most similar to the earliest plants is still uncertain, liverworts and hornworts may be the most reasonable models of what early plants were like. Most plant systematists now regard mosses as the bryophyte group most closely related to vascular plants (pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms).





 The gametophyte is the dominant generation in the life cycles of bryophytes

In all three bryophyte phyla, gametophytes are the most conspicuous, dominant phase of life history; sporophytes are typically smaller and present only part of the time.

If bryophyte spores are dispersed to a favorable habitat, such as moist soil or tree bark, they may germinate and grow into gametophytes by mitosis (FIGURE 29.16, p. 586). Germinating moss spores typically produce a mass of green, branched, one-cell-thick filaments, known as a protonema, that is sometimes mistaken for algae. Protonemata (plural, meaning "first threads") have a large surface area, enhancing absorption of water and minerals. When sufficient resources are available, a protonema produces buds having tissue-producing meristems. These meristems generate the mature, gamete-producing structure, which is known as a gametophore ("gamete bearer"). Together, the protonema and gametophores make up the gametophyte body of a moss.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-16. The life cycle of Polytrichum, a moss. The gametophyte is the prevalent generation in all bryophyte life cycles, a characteristic that contrasts with other plants.

Bryophyte gametophytes are generally only one or a few cells thick, which places all cells close to water and dissolved minerals. Most bryophytes lack conducting tissues that can distribute water and organic compounds within thick tissues. Though some bryophytes do have specialized tissues that function in water and solute conduction, cell walls in these tissues lack the lignin coating that is characteristic of vascular plant xylem. The absence of lignified vascular tissues also limits the height of bryophytes, most of which are only a few centimeters tall. Thus, most bryophytes grow close to the ground, anchored by delicate, colorless rhizoids. Rhizoids are long, tubular single cells (in liverworts and hornworts) or filaments of cells (in mosses). Rhizoids are not composed of tissues, they lack specialized conducting cells, and they do not play a primary role in water and mineral absorption. In these ways, rhizoids differ from the roots of vascular plants.

The gametophytes of hornworts and some liverworts are flattened (see FIGURE 29.15a and FIGURE 29.15b) and grow close to the ground. Moss gametophytes and those of some liverworts are described as "leafy" because they have stemlike structures that bear many leaflike appendages (see FIGURE 29.15a and FIGURE 29.15c). These are not true stems and leaves because they lack lignin-coated vascular cells. Moss "leaves" are usually only one cell thick and often lack a cuticle, features that enhance water and mineral absorption from the moist environment. However, the common "hairy cap" moss Polytrichum (FIGURE 29.15c) and its close relatives have more complex "leaves" with ridges that enhance absorption of sunlight. These leaf ridges are coated with cuticle. Polytrichum and some other mosses also possess conducting tissues in the center of their "stems," and a few mosses can grow as tall as 2 m as a result. Plant biologists are still trying to determine whether the conducting tissues of mosses are homologous with vascular plant xylem and phloem or are instead the analogous result of evolutionary convergence.

When the gametophores of bryophytes are mature, they produce gametes in gametangia. Eggs are produced singly in vase-shaped archegonia, and large numbers of sperm are produced in elongate antheridia (see FIGURE 29.16). Jackets of protective tissue enclose both types of gametangia. Bryophyte gametophytes can produce many archegonia and antheridia; in mosses these are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Flagellated sperm are released into water films in which they swim toward eggs, passing down the openings of archegonia in response to chemical attractants. Eggs are not released, but remain within the bases of archegonia. Gamete fusion results in the formation of zygotes, which are also retained by the archegonia during their development into young sporophytes. Layers of placental nutritive cells help transport materials from parent gametophyte to embryos. These nutrients help support the development of embryos into mature sporophytes.





 Bryophyte sporophytes disperse enormous numbers of spores

The cells of bryophyte sporophytes contain plastids that are usually green and photosynthetic when the sporophytes are young. Even so, bryophyte sporophytes are not capable of living apart from their maternal gametophytes. A bryophyte sporophyte remains attached to its parental gametophyte throughout the sporophyte's lifetime, dependent on the gametophyte for supplies of sugars, amino acids, minerals, and water.

Bryophytes have the smallest and simplest sporophytes of all modern plant groups, consistent with the hypothesis that sporophytes started small and simple, with larger and more complex sporophytes evolving only later in vascular plants. Among bryophytes, liverworts have the simplest sporophytes. You would need to use a magnifying glass to see their tiny bodies, which consist of a short stalk bearing a round sporangium with a protective epidermis enclosing developing spores. At the other end of the stalk, a nutritive foot is embedded in gametophyte tissues (FIGURE 29.17). Hornwort and moss sporophytes are larger and more complex. For example, hornwort sporophytes, which superficially resemble grass blades (see FIGURE 29.15b), possess a cuticle. The sporophytes of hornworts and mosses possess epidermal stomata similar to those of vascular plants.

Fig 29-17. Sporophyte of Marchantia, a liverwort. The tiny spore-producing sporophyte remains attached to the tissues of the parent gametophyte, which continues to nourish the sporophyte (LM).

Moss sporophytes are fairly conspicuous and familiar to most people. Though green and photosynthetic when young, moss sporophytes turn tan or brownish red when they are ready to release their spores, often remaining visible for months after spore discharge has occurred (see FIGURE 29.15c). Moss sporophytes consist of a foot, an elongated stalk known as a seta, and a spore-producing organ, the sporangium, or capsule (see FIGURE 29.16). The foot gathers sugars, amino acids, water, and minerals from the parent gametophyte via transfer cells. The seta conducts these materials to the capsule, which uses the resources to produce spores. In most mosses, the seta becomes elongated, which elevates the capsule and enhances spore dispersal.

The moss capsule (sporangium) is the site of meiosis and spore production; up to 50 million spores can be generated by one capsule. When the capsule is immature, it is covered with a protective cap of gametophyte tissue, the calyptra, but this cap is lost when the capsule is ready to release spores. The upper part of the capsule, known as a peristome, is often specialized for gradual spore discharge (FIGURE 29.18). As a result, the capsule sprinkles spores rather than dumping them out all at once. This gradual release allows mosses to take advantage of periodic wind gusts that can carry spores long distances.

Fig 29-18. A moss sporangium with a "spore-shaker" tip. At the tip of the sporangium of the moss Brachythecium, two rings of "teeth" regulate the gradual release of spores from the capsule. When conditions are moist, the two rings of teeth interlock and keep the spores inside the capsule. Drying causes the teeth to separate, allowing spores to disperse from the "shaker" you see here (SEM).





 Bryophytes provide many ecological and economic benefits

Wind dispersal of lightweight spores has distributed bryophytes around the world. These plants are particularly common and diverse in moist alpine, boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, as well as wetlands, where they form essential habitats for a variety of tiny animals. Some mosses even inhabit such extreme environments as mountaintops, arctic and antarctic tundra, and deserts; similarly harsh habitats likely challenged the earliest plants. Mosses are able to exist in very cold or dry habitats because many are able to lose most of their body water without dying, then rehydrate and reactivate their cells when moisture again becomes available. In contrast, few vascular plants can survive the same degree of desiccation. Moreover, phenolic compounds in moss cell walls absorb damaging levels of UV and other short-wavelength radiation present in deserts or at high altitudes and latitudes.

One moss genus is especially abundant and widespread. Sphagnum is a wetland moss that forms extensive deposits of undecayed organic material known as peat. Thus, Sphagnum is also called peat moss. Boggy regions dominated by this moss are known as peat bogs (FIGURE 29.19), and extensive high-latitude boreal regions occupied by Sphagnum are among the wetlands called peatlands. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the resistant phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. Sphagnum moss also secretes acidic and phenolic compounds that may reduce bacterial activity. Low temperatures and nutrient levels typical of peat bogs also inhibit microbial decay.

Fig 29-19. Sphagnum, or peat moss.

The world's peatlands store an estimated 400 billion tons of organic carbon. As carbon reservoirs, peatlands play an important role in stabilizing Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and hence climate (the role of atmospheric CO2 in climate is discussed in Chapter 54).

In the past, Sphagnum moss was widely used by aboriginal people for diapers and during wartime as a naturally antiseptic packing material for wounds. Today, Sphagnum is widely harvested for use as a soil conditioner and for packing plant roots during shipment. The usefulness of this moss is based on the presence of large, dead, water-absorbing cells, in addition to green, photosynthetic cells (see FIGURE 29.19c). This enables dry moss to absorb 20 times its weight in water. Some ecologists are concerned that overharvesting of Sphagnum will reduce its beneficial ecological effects.

Bryophytes were probably Earth's only plants for the first 100 million years that terrestrial communities existed. Then vegetation began to take on a taller profile with the evolution of vascular plants.





 Additional terrestrial adaptations evolved as vascular plants descended from mosslike ancestors

Vascular plants likely inherited tissue-producing meristems, gametangia, embryos and the sporophytes that develop from them, stomata, cuticles, and sporopollenin-walled spores from mosslike ancestors. Branched, independent sporophytes probably evolved next. The evidence for this is provided by a group of Silurian fossils with the long descriptive name protracheophyte ("before vascular plants") polysporangiophytes ("plants producing many sporangia"). We'll abbreviate by just using the first part of the name.

Protracheophytes were like bryophytes in lacking lignified vascular tissue, but were different in having branched sporophytes that were not dependent on gametophytes for their growth. Branched sporophytes make more complex bodies possible and also enable individual plants to produce many more spores. And more complex forms with multiple sporangia would stand a better chance of surviving and reproducing in spite of losing some of their vegetation and sporangia to herbivores. In contrast to modern vascular plants, which have much reduced gametophytes, fossils of early species indicate life cycles with gametophytes and sporophytes that were about equal in size.





 A diversity of vascular plants evolved over 400 million years ago

Cooksonia, named for the paleobotanist Isabel Cookson, is an extinct plant that left fossils over 408 million years old in the Silurian rocks of Europe and North America. It is the earliest-known vascular plant (FIGURE 29.20). Though its branched sporophytes stood only a few centimeters to 50 or so centimeters tall, Cooksonia had small lignified cells similar to the water-conducting cells in the xylem of modern pteridophytes (seedless vascular plants). Some of Cooksonia's branches terminated in bulbous sporangia, the sporophyte organs that produce spores.

Fig 29-20. Cooksonia, a vascular plant of the Silurian. The dichotomous (forked like a Y) branching and terminal sporangia characteristic of Cooksonia are evident in the photograph of the fossil on the left. Water-conducting cells were present in true stems, but true roots and leaves were absent. The plant was anchored by a rhizome, a horizontal stem. Cooksonia grew in dense stands around marshes. The largest species was about 50 cm tall.

By Devonian times, 362-408 million years ago, a diversity of vascular plants had evolved, as revealed in the fossil record. The seven extant vascular plant phyla listed in TABLE 29.1 are their descendants, including the two modern phyla of seedless vascular plants.





 Pteridophytes provide clues to the evolution of roots and leaves





One reason plant biologists study the morphology of ferns and other seedless plants is to explore some of the terrestrial adaptations that evolved in vascular plants, including true roots and leaves.

Most pteridophytes have true roots with lignified vascular tissue. The vascular system in these roots resembles that of the stems of early vascular plants, some of which left fossils so well preserved that researchers can study their internal tissues. This suggests that pteridophyte roots probably evolved from the lowermost, subterranean portions of stems of ancient vascular plants. It is uncertain whether roots of seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) arose independently, rather than being homologous to pteridophyte roots.

Lycophytes, the modern vascular plants that diverged earliest in plant phylogeny, have small leaves with only a single unbranched vein. These leaves probably evolved from tissue flaps on the surface of stems into which a strand of vascular tissue grew. Such leaves are known as microphylls (meaning "small leaves") (FIGURE 29.22a). In contrast, leaves of other modern vascular plants are known as megaphylls because they are typically much larger (FIGURE 29.22b). Their increased size is possible because such leaves are served by a highly branched vascular system. A branched vascular system can supply an expanded leaf with water and minerals and can export sugar from the photosynthetic tissue of the larger leaves. Thus, the branched vascular systems of megaphylls support a greater photosynthetic productivity compared to microphylls.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-22. Hypotheses for the evolution of leaves.

The study of fossils suggests that megaphylls evolved from a series of branches lying close together on a stem. Hypothetical stages in such a megaphyll origin were a flattening of the branch system and the development of tissue webbing that joined branches (see FIGURE 29.22b). According to this hypothesis, megaphylls could not have evolved in plants that lacked branched sporophytes and lignified vascular tissue. Thus, the evolution of true, branched stems likely preceded the origin of large leaves and roots (which probably evolved from the bases of stems).





 A sporophyte-dominant life cycle evolved in seedless vascular plants

Though pteridophytes lack seeds, they provide clues to the evolution of life cycle adaptations that enhanced the reproductive success of vascular plants on land.

From Cooksonia and the other early vascular plants to all of the vascular plants that live today, the sporophyte (diploid) generation is the larger and more complex plant in the alternation of generations. For example, the leafy fern plants familiar to us are the sporophytes. You would have to get down on your hands and knees and explore with careful hands and sharp eyes to find fern gametophytes, tiny plants growing on or just below the soil surface. Until you have a chance to do that, you can study the sporophyte-dominant life cycle of seedless vascular plants in FIGURE 29.23, page 592, which uses a fern as an example. Then, for review, compare this life cycle with FIGURE 29.16, which illustrates the gametophyte-dominated life cycles of bryophytes. In Chapter 30, you will see that the gametophyte generation became even more reduced during the evolution of seed plants, and it is there that we will consider this trend as an adaptation to living on land.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 29-23. The life cycle of a fern.

We can also use ferns to illustrate a key variation among vascular plants: the distinction between homosporous and heterosporous plants. The sporophyte of a homosporous plant produces a single type of spore. The fern depicted in FIGURE 29.23 is an example. Notice that each spore develops into a bisexual gametophyte having both female and male sex organs, the gametangia called archegonia and antheridia, respectively. In contrast, the sporophyte of a heterosporous plant produces two kinds of spores: Megaspores develop into female gametophytes bearing archegonia; microspores develop into male gametophytes with antheridia. Among ferns, those that returned to aquatic habitats during their evolution--the water ferns--are the only heterosporous species. However, we will see in Chapter 30 that the heterosporous condition was very important in the evolution of seeds.

The following diagrams will help you compare the homosporous and heterosporous conditions: 

The life cycle in FIGURE 29.23 illustrates one more point: The sperm cells of ferns and all other seedless vascular plants (and even some seed plants) are flagellated and must swim through a film of water to reach eggs, a characteristic shared with bryophytes. With their swimming sperm and fragile gametophytes, seedless vascular plants are most common in relatively damp habitats.





 Lycophyta and Pterophyta are the two phyla of modern seedless vascular plants

Phylum Lycophyta (Lycophytes)

Modern lycophytes are relicts of a far more eminent past. By the Carboniferous period, there were two evolutionary lines of lycophytes--one composed of relatively small, herbaceous plants and another line of giant woody trees having diameters of more than 2 m and heights of more than 40 m. The giant lycophytes thrived for millions of years in swamps common in the warm, moist Carboniferous climate, but became extinct when the climate became cooler and drier at the end of that geologic period. The small lycophytes survived, and they are represented today by about a thousand species. Common names for some lycophytes include "club mosses" or "ground pine," though they are neither mosses nor pines (see FIGURE 29.21a).

Many species of lycophytes are tropical plants that grow on trees as epiphytes--plants that use other organisms as a substratum but are not parasites. Other lycophyte species grow close to the ground on forest floors in temperate regions, including the northern United States. Lycophyte sporophytes have upright stems bearing many small green leaves (microphylls) and horizontal stems that grow along the ground surface. Roots extend downward from the horizontal stems. Groups of specialized leaves called sporophylls, which bear sporangia, are clustered to form club-shaped cones (also known as strobili). When they are mature, the oil-rich flammable spores are released in clouds. (Early photographers ignited lycophyte spores to provide a flash of light.) After the spores disperse, they develop into inconspicuous haploid gametophytes. Depending on the species, these tiny haploid plants may be either photosynthetic plants above ground or nonphotosynthetic plants underground. The underground species may live for as long as ten years, nurtured by symbiotic fungi.

Phylum Pterophyta (Ferns and Their Relatives)

Psilophytes. Plant biologists once considered Psilotum, the whisk fern, to be a "living fossil" (see FIGURE 29.21b). The dichotomous (Y-like) branching is reminiscent of ancient vascular plants, such as the Cooksonia in FIGURE 29.20. Whisk ferns also lack true leaves and roots, which reinforced the idea that they were surviving remnants of an early lineage of vascular plants. Thus, until recently, plant biologists placed Psilotum and a closely related genus in their own phylum. However, comparisons of DNA sequences and analysis of certain ultrastructural features, such as sperm structure, has convinced most plant systematists that the psilophytes are close relatives of the plants we commonly call ferns. According to this view, the lack of true roots and leaves evolved secondarily during the divergence of the psilophytes from the fern lineage.

Sphenophytes (Horsetails). Sphenophytes are commonly called horsetails because of their often brushy appearance (see FIGURE 29.21c). As with psilophytes, the sphenophytes were once granted their own phylum; but recent molecular data suggest that they are closely related to ferns and should be classified with them. During the Carboniferous period, sphenophytes were very diverse and grew as tall as 15 m, but today there exist only about 15 species of a single, widely distributed genus, Equisetum.

Horsetails are often found in marshy places or alongside streams and sandy roadsides. They possess both upright green stems and root-bearing horizontal stems (rhizomes) that extend along the ground. The erect stems are green and jointed, with a ring of tiny leaves or branches emerging from the joints. The upright stem actually serves as the major photosynthetic organ. Internally, horsetail stems are penetrated by large air canals that allow movement of oxygen down into rhizomes and roots, which often grow in waterlogged, low-oxygen soils. This adaptation probably first arose long ago in Carboniferous swamps, but it is still useful. Reproductive horsetail stems produce cones at their tips. Equisetum's cones, like those of certain lycophytes, are composed of clusters of sporophylls--leaves bearing sporangia.

Ferns. From their Devonian beginning, ferns radiated extensively and today include more than 12,000 species. Ferns grew alongside tree lycophytes and horsetails in the great swamp forests of the Carboniferous period, but are by far the most widespread and diverse of the pteridophytes today. Ferns are most diverse in the tropics, but there are many representatives in temperate forests, and a few are able to grow in arid habitats. Ferns often have horizontal rhizomes from which grow large leaves with extensively branched vascular systems. Fern leaves are commonly known as fronds and are often compound--that is, divided into many leaflets (see FIGURE 29.21d). The fern frond grows as its coiled tip, the fiddlehead, unfurls. Tree ferns have tall erect stems bearing a crown of fronds at the top.

Ferns produce clusters of sporangia known as sori (singular, sorus) on the undersides of the green leaves or on special, nongreen leaves (sporophylls). Sori can be arranged in various patterns, such as parallel lines or dots, that are useful in fern identification (FIGURE 29.24). Most fern sporangia are equipped with springlike devices that catapult spores several meters. Once airborne, spores can be blown by the wind far from their origin. Spores, protected by sporopollenin, are the main means of dispersal for all seedless plants.

 Seedless vascular plants formed vast "coal forests" during the Carboniferous period

The phyla Lycophyta and Pterophyta represent the modern lineages of seedless vascular plants that formed forests during the Carboniferous period about 290-360 million years ago (FIGURE 29.25). Seedless vascular plants of the Carboniferous forests left not only living relicts and fossils, but also fossil fuel in the form of coal.

Fig 29-25. Artist's conception of a Carboniferous forest based on fossil evidence. Most of the large trees with straight trunks are lycophytes. On the left, the tree with numerous feathery branches is a horsetail. Tree ferns, though not featured in this painting, were also abundant in the "coal forests" of the Carboniferous. Animals, including giant dragonflies like the one near the horsetail, also thrived.

Coal formed during several geologic periods, but the most extensive beds of coal are found in strata deposited during the Carboniferous, a time when most of the continents were flooded by shallow swamps. Europe and North America, located near the equator at that time, were covered by tropical swamp forests. Dead plants did not completely decay in the stagnant waters, and great depths of organic remains--peat--accumulated by a process similar to that occurring today in peat bogs. The swamps were later covered by the sea, and marine sediments piled up on top of the peat. Heat and pressure gradually converted the peat to coal, a "fossil fuel." Coal powered the Industrial Revolution, and some politicians advocate a resurgence in coal use as we continue to deplete oil and gas reserves. However, burning more coal will increase the industrial output of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" that contribute to global warming (see Chapter 55). Energy conservation and the development of alternative (nonfossil fuel) energy sources seem like prudent options instead.

Growing along with the seedless plants in Carboniferous swamps were primitive seed plants. Though seed plants were not the dominant plants at that time, they rose to prominence after the swamps began to dry up at the end of the Carboniferous period. The next chapter traces the origin and diversification of seed plants, continuing our theme of terrestrial adaptation.

The beautifully preserved squash seed in the photo, discovered in 1997 in a cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, symbolizes two important landmarks in the evolution of plants: (1) the evolution of seed plants, which led to the gymnosperms and angiosperms, the plants that dominate most modern landscapes, and (2) the emergence of the importance of seed plants to animals, specifically to humans in this case.

Why was this discovery front-page news for many newspapers and scientific journals? The cave had been occupied by humans some 8,000-10,000 years ago, and the seeds and pieces of squash fruit found there differ enough from wild varieties of the same species to suggest that humans had already begun cultivating the plants, perhaps more for gourds than for food. If this interpretation is correct, then agriculture started at about the same time--approximately 10,000 years ago--in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. (Before this discovery, scientists had been able to trace American agriculture back only about 5,000 years.) The invention of agriculture, which depends almost entirely on the cultivation and harvest of seed plants, was the single most important cultural change in the history of humanity, for it made possible the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to permanent settlements.

More generally, the seeds and other adaptations of gymnosperms and angiosperms enhanced the ability of plants to survive and reproduce in diverse terrestrial environments, and these plants became the main producers supporting the food webs of most ecosystems on land. Our study of gymnosperms and angiosperms begins with an overview of some of the key terrestrial adaptations that seed plants added to those already in place in the bryophytes and seedless vascular plants you learned about in Chapter 29.





OVERVIEW OF SEED PLANT EVOLUTION

 

 Reduction of the gametophyte continued with the evolution of seed plants



 

 Seeds became an important means of dispersing offspring



 

 Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization



 

 The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms



Seed plants are vascular plants that produce seeds. Modifications in life cycles contributed to the success of seed plants as terrestrial organisms. Here we examine the three most important reproductive adaptations: continued reduction of the gametophyte, the advent of the seed, and the evolution of pollen.





GYMNOSPERMS

 

 The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms



 

 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers



 

 The life cycle of a pine demonstrates the key reproductive adaptations of seed plants



The most familiar gymnosperms are the conifers, the cone-bearing plants such as pines. Gymnosperms (the term means "naked seeds") lack the enclosed chambers (ovaries) in which angiosperm ovules and seeds develop. Rather, gymnosperm ovules and seeds develop on the surfaces of specialized leaves called sporophylls. Gymnosperms appear in the fossil record much earlier than angiosperms.





ANGIOSPERMS (FLOWERING PLANTS)

 

 Systematists are identifying the angiosperm clades



 

 The flower is the defining reproductive adaptation of angiosperms



 

 Fruits help disperse the seeds of angiosperms



 

 The life cycle of an angiosperm is a highly refined version of the alternation of generations common to all plants



 

 The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era



 

 Angiosperms and animals have shaped one another's evolution



Angiosperms, better known as flowering plants, are vascular seed plants that produce the reproductive structures called flowers and fruits. Today, angiosperms are by far the most diverse and geographically widespread of all plants. There are about 250,000 known species of angiosperms, compared with about 720 gymnosperm species.





PLANTS AND HUMAN WELFARE

 

 Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms



 

 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource



The absolute dependence of humans on Earth's flora is a specific and highly refined case of the more general connection between animals and plants. Of course, we humans, like most of Earth's species, depend on photosynthetic organisms for their ecological "services" of food production and oxygen release. What is special about our relationship with plants is our development of technology to maximize the harvest of plant products for human use. The lumber industry is an example. But the most important example is agriculture.





 Reduction of the gametophyte continued with the evolution of seed plants

In Chapter 29, we discussed an important distinction between the life cycles of mosses and other bryophytes and the life cycles of ferns and other seedless vascular plants: a gametophyte-dominant life cycle for bryophytes versus a sporophyte-dominant life cycle for seedless vascular plants. That trend continued with the evolution of seed plants--the gymnosperms and angiosperms. The gametophytes of seed plants are even more reduced than the gametophytes of seedless vascular plants such as ferns. And in seed plants, the miniature female gametophytes develop from spores that are retained within the sporangia of the parental sporophyte. One advantage of this arrangement is that the delicate female gametophytes do not have to cope with many environmental stresses. These female gametophytes and the young embryos they produce after fertilization are sheltered from drought and harmful UV radiation by their enclosure within the moist reproductive tissues of the parental sporophyte generation. This relationship also makes it possible for the gametophytes to obtain nutrients from their parents. In contrast, the free- living gametophytes of seedless vascular plants must fend for themselves (see FIGURE 29.23).

This protection of female gametophytes within sporophyte tissues required extreme miniaturization of the gametophytes. The free-living gametophytes of seedless vascular plants (pteridophytes), though small compared to the sporophytes, are visible to the unaided eye. But the gametophytes of seed plants are microscopic. FIGURE 30.1 reviews this terrestrial adaptation of seed plants by contrasting the sporophyte-gametophyte relationships for different plant groups.

Fig 30-1. Three variations on gametophyte/sporophyte relationships.

Why has the gametophyte generation not been completely eliminated from the plant life cycle? One hypothesis is that haploid gametophytes provide a mechanism for "screening" alleles, including new mutations. Gametophytes with deleterious mutations that affect basic metabolism and cell division will not survive to produce gametes that could combine to start new sporophytes.

Another possible reason that the gametophyte has not gone completely "out of style" in seed plants is that all sporophyte embryos are dependent, at least to some extent, on tissues of the maternal gametophyte. You learned, for example, that in bryophytes the embryonic sporophyte is nourished by a gametophyte as it grows from the archegonium. You'll soon learn that even in seed plants, the gametophyte continues to play a role in nourishing the sporophyte embryo, at least during its early development.





 Seeds became an important means of dispersing offspring

In bryophytes and seedless vascular plants such as ferns, spores produced by sporophytes are the resistant stage in the life cycle--that is, the stage that can withstand harsh environments. (A spore, recall from Chapter 29, is a resistant cell that can develop into a new organism.) For example, the spores of a moss might be able to survive even if the local environment becomes too cold, too hot, or too dry for the moss plants themselves to live. And because of their tiny size, the spores might also be dispersed in a dormant state to a new area, where they will germinate to give rise to new moss gametophytes if and when the environment is favorable enough for them to break dormancy. Spores were the main way that plants spread over the Earth for the first 200 million years of plant life on land.

The seed represents a different solution to resisting harsh environments and dispersing offspring. In contrast to a spore, which is single-celled, a seed is a resistant structure that is multicellular and much more complex. A seed consists of a sporophyte embryo packaged along with a food supply within a protective coat. There are evolutionary and developmental relationships between spores and seeds. Recall from the previous section that the reduced gametophytes of seed plants develop within tissues of the parental sporophyte. This occurs because the parent sporophyte does not release its spores, but instead retains them within its sporangia. Not only are the spores retained within the sporangia instead of being released, but the gametophyte develops within the confines of the spore from which it is derived (see FIGURE 30.1c).

All seed plants are heterosporous, meaning they have two different types of sporangia that produce two types of spores: Megasporangia produce megaspores, which give rise to female (egg-containing) gametophytes; microsporangia produce microspores, which give rise to male (sperm-containing) gametophytes. And recall from Chapter 29 that some seedless vascular plants, including certain ferns, are also hetero sporous. The gametophytes of those plants develop within the spore walls, as they do in seed plants. What distinguishes seed plants is that the megaspores, and hence the female gametophytes, are retained on the parent sporophyte.

In seed plants, layers of sporophyte tissues called integuments envelop the megasporangium. Thus a megaspore formed within the megasporangium is very well protected. The whole structure--integuments, megasporangium, and megaspore--is called an ovule (FIGURE 30.2a). A female gametophyte develops inside a megaspore and produces one or more egg cells. And if an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm (FIGURE 30.2b), the zygote develops into a sporophyte embryo. The whole ovule develops into a seed (FIGURE 30.2c).

Fig 30-2. From ovule to seed.

A seed's protective seed coat is derived from the integuments of the ovule. Once released from the parent plant, a seed may remain dormant for days, months, or even years. Under favorable conditions, the seed can then germinate, its sporophyte embryo emerging through the seed coat as a seedling. Some seeds drop close to their parents; others are carried far by wind or animals (FIGURE 30.3).

 Pollen eliminated the liquid-water requirement for fertilization

We have seen the relationship of the megasporangium to the ovule and the seed, but what goes on in a microsporangium of a seed plant? Microspores develop into pollen grains, which mature to become the male gametophytes of seed plants. The pollen grains, protected by tough sporopollenin-containing coats (see p. 580), can be carried away by wind or animals after their release from the microsporangium.

The transfer of pollen to ovules is called pollination. If a pollen grain lands in the vicinity of an ovule, it will elongate a tube that discharges one or more sperm into the female gametophyte within the ovule (see FIGURE 30.2b). In some gymnosperms, the sperm cells retain the ancestral flagellated condition. But in the most common gymnosperms (the conifers) and in all angiosperms (flowering plants), the sperm lack flagella.

This mechanism for transfer of sperm contrasts sharply with what we observed in seedless plants. Recall that in bryophytes and pteridophytes such as ferns, flagellated sperm released from antheridia must swim through a film of water to reach egg cells in archegonia. The distance for this sperm transport rarely exceeds a few centimeters. In seed plants, the use of resistant, far-traveling, airborne pollen to bring gametes together is a terrestrial adaptation that led to even greater success and diversity of plants on land.





 The two clades of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms

Progress in biology due to new methods, new data, and new ideas is what makes this subject so much fun. Each new edition of this textbook requires revision of most of the phylogenetic trees to reflect the ongoing revolution in systematics. Phylogenetic trees and the classifications they inform, remember, are hypotheses about the history of life. And in the case of seed plant phylogeny, the data now support a tree with two main monophyletic branches--the gymnosperms and the angiosperms--as depicted in FIGURE 30.4. Gymnosperms and angiosperms probably evolved from different ancestors in an extinct group of plants called progymnosperms, some of which had seeds.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-4. Hypothetical phylogeny of the seed plants. Recent research supports the division of the seed plants into two distinct clades (monophyletic branches), the gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, evolutionary relationships among the major groups within each of the two seed-plant clades is less certain, which is why the bases of those subbranches are broken lines in this diagram. The numbering of the seed-plant phyla in this tree corresponds to our introduction to plant diversity in Chapter 29, reviewed here in the inset. Note that the taxonomy adopted by this text recognizes four phyla of gymnosperms, but groups all angiosperms into a single phylum, Anthophyta.

The two key reproductive adaptations of seed plants--seeds and pollen--will seem less abstract once we have looked more closely at the diversity of gymnosperms and angiosperms.





 The Mesozoic era was the age of gymnosperms





The gymnosperms probably descended from progymnosperms, a group of Devonian plants (see FIGURE 30.4). The earliest progymnosperms were seedless plants, but by the end of the Devonian period, seeds had evolved in some progymnosperm species. Adaptive radiation during the Carboniferous and early Permian produced the various phyla of gymnosperms.

In the history of life, the Permian period was one of great crises. Formation of the supercontinent Pangaea (see Chapter 25) may have been one reason that continental interiors became warmer and drier as the Permian progressed. The flora and fauna of Earth changed dramatically, as many groups of organisms disappeared and others emerged as their successors. The changeover was most pronounced in the seas, but terrestrial life was affected as well. In the animal kingdom, amphibians decreased in diversity and were replaced by reptiles, which were especially well adapted to the arid conditions. Similarly, the lycophytes, horsetails, and ferns that dominated the Carboniferous swamps were largely replaced by gymnosperms, which were more suited to the drier climate. The world and its life had changed so markedly that geologists use the end of the Permian period, about 245 million years ago, as the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. (This boundary was originally defined by the changeover in marine fossils.) The terrestrial animals of the Mesozoic, including the dinosaurs, were supported by a vegetation consisting mostly of conifers and great palmlike cycads, two phyla of gymnosperms. At the end of the Mesozoic, a powerful meteorite or comet impact and intensive volcanic activity contributed to a cooler climate, and the dinosaurs became extinct. Many of the gymnosperms persisted, however, and are still an important part of Earth's flora.





 The four phyla of extant gymnosperms are ginkgo, cycads, gnetophytes, and conifers

Of the ten plant phyla in the taxonomic scheme adopted by this textbook (see TABLE 29.1), four are grouped as gymnosperms (see FIGURE 30.4). Three are relatively small phyla: Ginkgophyta, Cycadophyta, and Gnetophyta. Ginkgo biloba is the only extant species of phylum Ginkgophyta. It has fanlike leaves that turn gold and are deciduous in autumn (FIGURE 30.5). Gingko is the source of a popular over-the-counter herbal preparation that some people believe improves memory. Cycads (phylum Cycadophyta) superficially resemble palms, which are actually flowering plants (FIGURE 30.6). Phylum Gnetophyta consists of three genera that are very different in appearance (FIGURE 30.7). One, Welwitschia, has giant straplike leaves. Plants of the second genus, Gnetum, grow in the tropics as trees or vines. Ephedra (Mormon tea), the third genus of Gnetophyta, is a shrub of the American deserts.

The left photo illustrates the summer green leaf color, while the top inset shows the leaves in autumn gold. Female trees produce fleshy seeds (bottom inset) whose seed coats emit a repulsive (to humans, at least) odor as they decay. The rotting flesh produces some of the same organic acids found in rancid butter, skunk spray, and human body odor, so landscapers usually plant only male (pollen-producing) trees.

By far the largest of the four gymnosperm phyla is phylum Coniferophyta, the conifers. The term conifer (from the Latin conus, cone, and ferre, to carry) comes from the reproductive structure of these plants, the cone, which is a cluster of scalelike sporophylls. Pines, firs, spruces, larches, yews, junipers, cedars, cypresses, and redwoods all belong to this phylum of gymnosperms (FIGURE 30.8, p. 604). Many are large trees. Although there are only about 550 species of conifers, a few of those species dominate vast forested regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where the growing season is relatively short because of latitude or altitude.

"Doug fir" provides more timber than any other North American tree species. Uses for the wood include house framing, plywood production, pulpwood for paper, railroad ties, and boxes and crates. (b) Sequoia. This giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in California's Sequoia National Park dwarfs the tourists at the bottom of this scene. It weighs about 2,500 metric tons, equivalent to about 14 blue whales (the largest animals), or 40,000 people. (c) Cypress. The "Lone Cypress" (Cupressus macrocarpa) in Monterey, California, is one of the world's most photographed trees. (d) Pacific yew. The bark of Pacific yew (Taxa brevifolia) is a source of taxol, a compound used to treat women with ovarian cancer. The leaves of a European yew species produce a similar compound, which can be harvested without destroying the plants. And pharmaceutical companies are now refining techniques for synthesizing drugs with taxol-like properties. (e) Common juniper. The "berries" of the common juniper (Juniperus communis) are actually ovule-producing cones consisting of fleshy sporophylls. An extract from juniper "berries" gives gin its distinctive flavor. (f) A pine farm. This loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) farm in South Carolina is a clone of fast-growing trees cultivated from cell cultures that produce seedlings (inset). (g) Wollemia pine. A survivor of a conifer group once known only from fossils, the Wollemia pine (Wollemia nobilis) was discovered alive in 1994 in a national park only 150 kilometers from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The species has only 40 known individuals in two small groves. The inset compares the leaves of this "living fossil" with actual fossils.

Most conifers are evergreens, meaning they retain leaves throughout the year. Even during winter, a limited amount of photosynthesis occurs on sunny days. And when spring comes, conifers already have fully developed leaves that can take advantage of the sunnier days. However, some conifers have deciduous leaves that drop in the autumn. The dawn redwood and tamarack are two examples.

The needle-shaped leaves of some conifers, such as pines and firs, are adapted to dry conditions. A thick cuticle covers the leaf, and the stomata are located in pits, further reducing water loss.

We get much of our lumber and paper pulp from the wood of conifers. What we call wood is actually xylem tissue, which gives the tree structural support.

Coniferous trees are among the largest and oldest organisms on Earth. Redwoods, found only in a narrow coastal strip of northern California, grow to heights of more than 110 m; only certain eucalyptus trees in Australia are taller. Bristlecone pines, another species of California conifer, are among the oldest organisms alive. One bristlecone, named Methuselah, is more than 4,600 years old; it was a young tree when humans invented writing.





 The life cycle of a pine demonstrates the key reproductive adaptations of seed plants

You learned earlier in the chapter that the evolution of seed plants added three key terrestrial adaptations in reproduction: the increasing dominance of the sporophyte generation; the advent of the seed as a resistant, dispersible stage in the life cycle; and the evolution of pollen as an airborne agent that brings gametes together. Examining the life cycle of a pine, one of the most familiar of conifers and gymnosperms, will reinforce your understanding of these adaptations (FIGURE 30.9, p. 605).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-9. The life cycle of a pine. 
			  
		 Trees (sporophytes) of most species bear both pollen cones and ovulate cones. 
			  
		 A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia held in small reproductive leaves, or sporophylls. Cells in the micro sporangia undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid microspores that develop into pollen grains (immature male gametophytes). 
			  
		 An ovulate cone consists of many scales, each with two ovules. Each ovule includes a megasporangium. 
			  
		 During pollination, windblown pollen falls on the ovulate cone and is drawn into the ovule through the micropyle. The pollen grain germinates in the ovule, forming a pollen tube that begins to digest its way through the megasporangium. Fertilization usually occurs more than a year after pollination. During that year, 
			  
		 a megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid cells. One of these cells survives as a megaspore, which grows and divides repeatedly, giving rise to the immature female gametophyte. Notice that the gametophyte develops within the spore. 
			  
		 Two or three archegonia, each with an egg, then develop within the gametophyte. 
			  
		 By the time eggs are ready to be fertilized, two sperm cells have developed in the male gametophyte (pollen grain), and the pollen tube has extended to the female gametophyte. Fertilization occurs when one of the sperm nuclei, injected into an egg cell by the pollen tube, unites with the egg nucleus. All the eggs in an ovule may be fertilized, but usually only one zygote develops into an embryo. 
			  
		 The pine embryo, the new sporophyte, has a rudimentary root and several embryonic leaves. A food supply, consisting of the female gametophyte, surrounds and nourishes the embryo. The ovule has developed into a pine seed, which consists of an embryo (new sporophyte), its food supply (derived from gametophyte tissue), and a surrounding seed coat derived from the integuments of the parent tree (parent sporophyte). Notice that three plant generations--one gametophyte and two sporophyte generations--are represented in a gymnosperm seed.

The pine tree is a sporophyte. Its sporangia are located on scalelike sporophylls that are packed densely in structures called cones. The female gametophyte generation develops from haploid spores that are retained within the sporangia. Conifers, like all seed plants, are heterosporous; male and female gametophytes develop from different types of spores produced by separate cones (FIGURE 30.10, p. 606). Each tree usually has both types of cones. Small pollen cones produce microspores that develop into the male gametophytes, or pollen grains. Larger ovulate cones make megaspores that develop into female gametophytes. From the time young cones appear on the tree, it takes nearly three years to produce the male and female gametophytes, bring them together via pollination, and form mature seeds from the fertilized ovules. The scales of the ovulate cone then separate, and the seeds travel on the wind. A seed that lands in a habitable place germinates, its embryo emerging as a pine seedling.

 Systematists are identifying the angiosperm clades

All angiosperms are placed in a single phylum, the phylum Anthophyta (from the Greek antho, flower). If you return to FIGURE 30.4, you'll find a division into different angiosperm lineages that contrasts sharply with what we would have diagrammed three years ago. Until the late 1990s, most plant taxonomists divided the angiosperms into two main classes, the monocots and the dicots, which differ in several anatomical and morphological details. For example, most monocots have leaves with veins running parallel (think of a grass blade), while most dicots have netlike venation in their leaves (think of an oak leaf). A combination of molecular systematics and cladistic analysis has upheld the monocots as a monophyletic group--a clade. Examples of monocots are lilies, orchids, yuccas, palms, and grasses, including lawn grasses, sugar cane, and grain crops (corn, wheat, rice, and others). However, comparisons of DNA revealed that not all plants having the dicot type of anatomy fall into a single monophyletic group. One clade, the eudicots, does include the majority of dicots. Examples of eudicots are roses, peas, buttercups, sunflowers, oaks, and maples. But some of the other dicots actually belong to angiosperm lineages that diverged earlier than the origin of either monocots or eudicots. For example, the branch in FIGURE 30.4 labeled "other early angiosperm lines" includes a dicot called the star anise. And the water lilies belong to an even older angiosperm lineage. But the oldest angiosperm branch of all is represented by a single species, Amborella trichopoda (FIGURE 30.11b).

(c) Water lilies, such as this Nymphaea carulea, are modern members of a clade predated only by the Amborella lineage. (d) Other early angiosperm lineages include species such as this Illicium floridanum, or star anise. (e) This orchid (Paphiopedilum furheyo) is an example of a monocot. There are about 65,000 species of monocots. (f) The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) is just one of 165,000 species of eudicots.

Amborella was an unlikely candidate to become the center of attention among biologists interested in plant phylogeny. A small shrub with tiny flowers and tiny fruit, Amborella is found only on New Caledonia, a South Pacific island. In 1999, four independent research teams published evidence that Amborella is the most "primitive" known angiosperm--primitive in the sense that the molecular evidence places it on the oldest branch of angiosperm evolution. A plant most botanists didn't know existed a few years ago has become a focal point in research efforts to trace the evolution of flowering plants.

What evolutionary "innovations" contributed most to the enormous success of angiosperms? Refinements in vascular tissue, especially xylem, probably played a role in the spread of angiosperms into diverse terrestrial habitats. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are equipped with xylem cells called tracheids. These are long, tapered cells that function in both mechanical support and water transport (FIGURE 30.12). In addition to these tracheids, the xylem of angiosperms also has fiber cells, which are specialized for support. A third type of xylem cell, called a vessel element, is also found in most angiosperms. Compared to tracheids, vessel elements are shorter and wider, and they are arranged end-to-end into continuous tubes--xylem vessels--that are more efficient than tracheids in transporting water. Amborella has tracheids, but not vessels, suggesting that true vessel elements evolved in angiosperms after Amborella branched off as a distinct lineage.

Whatever roles evolutionary refinements in vascular tissue and other structural characteristics played in plant history, it was probably the reproductive adaptations associated with flowers and fruits that contributed most to making angiosperms so successful.





 The flower is the defining reproductive adaptation of angiosperms

The flower is an angiosperm structure specialized for reproduction. In many angiosperms, insects and other animals transfer pollen from one flower to female sex organs on another flower, which makes pollination less random than the wind-dependent pollination of most gymnosperms. However, some flowering plants are wind-pollinated, a characteristic especially common for plants that occur in dense populations, such as grasses and tree species in temperate forests.

A flower is a specialized shoot with four circles of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (FIGURE 30.13). Starting at the bottom of the flower are the sepals, which are usually green. They are modified leaves that enclose the flower before it opens (think of a rosebud). Above the sepals are the petals, brightly colored in most flowers. They aid in attracting insects and other pollinators. Flowers that are wind-pollinated generally lack bright-colored parts. The sepals and petals are sterile floral parts, meaning that they are not directly involved in reproduction. Within the ring of petals are the fertile sporophylls, the leaf-derived parts that produce spores. The two rings of sporophylls are the stamens and carpels. Stamens are the male reproductive organs, the sporophylls that produce microspores that give rise to male gametophytes. Carpels are the female sporophylls, the organs that make megaspores and their products, female gametophytes. A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a terminal sac, the anther, where pollen is produced. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that receives pollen. A style leads to the ovary at the base of the carpel. Protected within the ovary are the ovules, which develop into seeds after fertilization.

Recall that the enclosure of seeds within the ovary is one of the features that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms. The carpel probably evolved from a seed-bearing leaf (sporophyll) that became rolled into a tube (FIGURE 30.14). Some angiosperms, such as garden peas, have flowers with single carpels. Others, such as magnolias, have several separate carpels. Still other species, such as lilies, have two or more fused carpels, usually forming an ovary with multiple ovule-containing chambers.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-14. Hypothesis for the origin of the carpel from a reproductive leaf (sporophyll). The enclosure of ovules (and seeds) within an ovary may have resulted from the rolling of leaves bearing megasporangia on their margins. A similar process may have trans formed sporophylls with microsporangia into the anthers of stamens.





 Fruits help disperse the seeds of angiosperms

A fruit is a mature ovary. As seeds develop from ovules after fertilization, the wall of the ovary thickens. A pea pod is an example of a fruit, with seeds (mature ovules, the peas) encased in the ripened ovary (the pod) (FIGURE 30.15). Fruits protect dormant seeds and aid in their dispersal.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 30-15. Relationship between a pea flower and a fruit (pea pod). At the same time that the ovules are transformed into seeds, the ovary and other flower parts are transformed into a fruit we call a pod.

Various modifications in fruits help disperse seeds (FIGURE 30.16). Some flowering plants, such as dandelions and maples, have seeds within fruits that function like kites or propellers, adaptations that enhance dispersal by wind. However, many angiosperms use animals to carry seeds. Some of these plants have fruits modified as burrs that cling to animal fur (or to the clothes of humans). Other angiosperms produce edible fruits. Such fruits are usually nutritious, often sweet-tasting, and commonly vividly colored, which advertises their ripeness to certain animals. When it eats the fruit, the animal digests the fleshy part, but the tough seeds usually pass unharmed through the digestive tract. Mammals and birds may deposit seeds, along with a supply of fertilizer, miles from where the fruit was eaten.

The fruit begins to develop after pollination triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to grow (see FIGURE 30.15). The wall of the ovary becomes the pericarp, the thickened wall of the fruit. As the ovary grows, the other parts of the flower wither away in many plants. If a flower has not been pollinated, fruit usually does not develop, and the entire flower withers and falls away.

Fruits are classified into several types, depending on their developmental origin (TABLE 30.1, p. 610). A fruit derived from a single ovary is called a simple fruit. A simple fruit may be fleshy, such as a cherry, or dry, such as a soybean pod. An aggregate fruit, such as a blackberry, results from a single flower that has several carpels. A multiple fruit, such as a pineapple, develops from an inflorescence, a group of flowers tightly clustered together. When the walls of the many ovaries start to thicken, they fuse together and become incorporated into one fruit.

By selectively breeding plants, humans have capitalized on the production of edible fruits. The apples, oranges, and other fruits in grocery stores are exaggerated versions of much smaller natural varieties of fleshy fruits. However, the staple foods for humans are the dry, wind-dispersed fruits of grasses, which are harvested while still on the parent plant. The cereal grains of wheat, rice, corn, and other grasses are easily mistaken for seeds, but each is actually a fruit with a dry pericarp that adheres tightly to the seed coat of the single seed within.

Interactions with animals that transport pollen and seeds have helped angiosperms become the most successful plants on Earth. However, as we will see, the angiosperm life cycle was not an evolutionary "invention," but was built upon adaptive themes we have tracked in our study of plant diversity.





 The life cycle of an angiosperm is a highly refined version of the alternation of generations common to all plants

Angiosperms are heterosporous, a characteristic they share with all seed plants. The flower of the sporophyte produces microspores that form male gametophytes and megaspores that form female gametophytes (FIGURE 30.17). The immature male gametophytes are contained within pollen grains, which develop within the anthers of stamens. Each pollen grain has two haploid cells. Ovules, which develop in the ovary, contain the female gametophyte, also known as the embryo sac. It consists of only a few cells, one of which is the egg. (We'll describe the development of pollen and the embryo sac in more detail in Chapter 38.) Notice that the evolutionary trend toward reduction of the gametophyte generation in vascular plants continued with the angiosperms.

		 Double fertilization occurs, and 
			  
		 zygotes develop into sporophyte embryos that are packaged along with food into seeds. (The fruit tissues surrounding the seed are omitted in this diagram.) When a seed germinates, the embryo grows and develops into a sporophyte.

After its release from the anther, the pollen is carried to the sticky stigma at the tip of a carpel. Although some flowers self-pollinate, most have mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination, the transfer of pollen from flowers of one plant to flowers of another plant of the same species. In some cases, stamens and carpels of a single flower may mature at different times, or the organs may be so arranged within the flower that self-pollination is unlikely.

The pollen grain germinates (begins growing) after it adheres to the stigma of a carpel. The pollen grain, now containing a mature male gametophyte, extends a tube that grows down within the style of the carpel. After it reaches the ovary, the pollen tube penetrates through the micropyle, a pore in the integuments of the ovule, and discharges two sperm cells into the female gametophyte (embryo sac). One sperm nucleus unites with the egg, forming a diploid zygote. The other sperm nucleus fuses with the two nuclei in the large center cell of the female gametophyte. This central cell now has a triploid (3n) nucleus. This phenomenon, known as double fertilization, is characteristic of angiosperms. (Double fertilization also evolved independently in some gymnosperms of phylum Gnetophyta.)

After double fertilization, the ovule matures into a seed. The zygote develops into a sporophyte embryo with a rudimentary root and either one or two seed leaves, the cotyledons (monocots have one seed leaf and dicots have two, hence their names). The triploid nucleus in the center of the embryo sac divides repeatedly, giving rise to a triploid tissue called endosperm, rich in starch and other food reserves. Monocot seeds such as corn store most of their food in the endosperm. Beans and many other dicots transfer most of the nutrients from the endosperm to the developing cotyledons.

What is the function of double fertilization? According to one hypothesis, double fertilization synchronizes the development of food storage in the seed with development of the embryo. If a particular flower is not pollinated or sperm cells are not discharged into the embryo sacs, fertilization does not occur and neither embryo nor endosperm forms. Perhaps double fertilization is an adaptation that prevents flowering plants from squandering nutrients on infertile ovules.

The seed consists of the embryo, endosperm, sporangium, and a seed coat derived from the integuments (outer layers of the ovule). An ovary develops into a fruit as its ovules develop into seeds. After being dispersed by wind or animals, a seed germinates if environmental conditions are favorable. The coat ruptures and the embryo emerges as a seedling, using the food stored in the endosperm and cotyledons.





 The radiation of angiosperms marks the transition from the Mesozoic era to the Cenozoic era

Earth's landscapes changed dramatically with the origin and radiation of flowering plants. The ancestry of angiosperms is still uncertain, but, as discussed earlier, cladistic analysis of gene-sequence data points to Amborella and water lilies such as Nymphaea as the closest living relatives of early angio sperms (see FIGURE 30.11). The oldest fossils that are widely accepted as angiosperms are found in rocks of the early Cretaceous period that are about 130 million years old. In such rock strata, angiosperms are sparsely represented among a much greater abundance of ferns and gymnosperms. By the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, following a period of environmental disturbance, the angiosperms had radiated and become the dominant plants on Earth, as they are today. The change in fossils during the late Cretaceous is so extreme that geologists use the end of that period as the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.





 Angiosperms and animals have shaped one another's evolution

Ever since they colonized the land, animals have influenced the evolution of terrestrial plants, and vice versa. The fact that animals must eat affects the natural selection of both animals and plants. For instance, with animals crawling and foraging for food on the forest floor, natural selection must have favored plants that kept their spores and gametophytes far above ground, rather than dropping these crucial structures to within reach of hungry animals on the ground. This, in turn, may have been a selection factor in the evolution of flying insects. On the other hand, as plants with flowers and fruits evolved, some herbivores became beneficial to the plants by carrying the pollen and seeds of plants they used as food. Certain animals became specialists at these tasks, feeding on specific plants. Natural selection reinforced these interactions, for they improved the reproductive success of both partners: The plant got pollinated and the animal got fed. The mutual evolutionary influence between two species is termed coevolution. (This definition is refined in Chapter 53.)

Pollinator-plant relationships are partly responsible for the diversity of flowers (FIGURE 30.18, p. 612). In most cases, relationships between plants and their pollinators are less specific than in the extreme coevolution between one plant species and one animal species. For example, the flowers of a particular plant species may be adapted for attracting insects rather than birds, but many different insect species may serve as pollinators. Conversely, a single animal species--a honeybee species, for example--may pollinate many different plant species. But even in these less specific relationships, flower color, fragrance, and structure often reflect specialization for a particular taxonomic group of pollinators, such as diverse species of bees or hummingbirds.

Fig 30-18. Flower-pollinator relationships. (a) Scottish broom flower and honeybee. This honeybee is harvesting pollen and nectar (a sugary solution secreted by flower glands) from a Scottish broom flower. The flower has a tripping mechanism that arches the stamens over the bee and dusts it with pollen, some of which will rub off onto the stigma of the next flower the bee visits. (b) Floral tubes and hummingbird. The long, thin beak and tongue of this rufous hummingbird enable the animal to probe flowers that secrete nectar deep within floral tubes. Before the hummer leaves, anthers will dust its beak and head feathers with pollen. Many flowers that are pollinated by birds are red or pink, colors to which bird eyes are especially sensitive. (c) Fragrance and nighttime pollinators. Some angiosperms, such as this baobab tree, depend mainly on nocturnal pollinators, including bats. Common adaptations of such plants include large, light-colored, highly fragrant flowers that nighttime pollinators can locate.

Relationships between angiosperms and animals are also evident in the edible fruits of angiosperms, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Again, we see that one of the keys to angiosperm success has been interaction with animals.





 Agriculture is based almost entirely on angiosperms

A visit to the produce section of a market is a colorful reminder that even city folk depend on farms. Flowering plants provide nearly all our food. All of our fruit and vegetable crops are angiosperms. Corn, rice, wheat, and the other grains are grass fruits. The endosperm of the grain seeds is the main food source for most of the people of the world and their domesticated animals. We also grow angiosperms for fiber, medications, perfumes, and decoration.

Like other animals, early humans probably collected wild seeds and fruits. Agriculture was gradually developed as humans began sowing seeds and cultivating plants to have a more dependable food source. As they domesticated certain plants, such as the squash represented by the seed in the photo that introduced this chapter, humans began to intervene in plant evolution by selective breeding designed to improve the quantity and quality of the foods the crops produced. Agriculture is a unique kind of evolutionary relationship between plants and animals.





 Plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource

The exploding human population and its demand for space and natural resources are extinguishing plant species at an unprecedented rate. The problem is especially critical in the tropics, where more than half the human population lives and population growth is fastest. Tropical rain forests are being destroyed at a frightening pace. The most common cause of this destruction is slash-and-burn clearing of the forest for agricultural use. Fifty million acres, an area about the size of the state of Washington, are cleared each year, a rate that would completely eliminate Earth's tropical forests within 25 years. As the forest disappears, so do thousands of plant species. Extinction is irrevocable; plant diversity is a nonrenewable resource. Insects and other rain forest animals that depend on these plants are also vanishing. In all, researchers estimate that the destruction of habitat in the rain forest and other ecosystems is claiming hundreds of species each year. The toll is greatest in the tropics, because that is where most species live; but environmental assault is a generically human tendency. Europeans eliminated most of their forests centuries ago, and habitat destruction is endangering many species in North America (FIGURE 30.19).

(b) Slash-and-burn clearing of a tropical rainforest in the Amazon Basin to provide temporary farmland that will become unproductive in just a few years because of depletion of soil nutrients.

Many people have ethical concerns about contributing to the extinction of living forms. But there are also practical reasons to be concerned about the loss of plant diversity. We depend on plants for thousands of products, including food, building materials, and medicines. TABLE 30.2 lists only a few examples of how we use the unique secondary compounds of plants (see p. 582 to review secondary compounds). So far, we have explored the potential uses of only a tiny fraction of the 250,000 known plant species. For example, almost all our food is based on the cultivation of only about two dozen species. More than 25%  of prescription drugs are extracted from plants, and many more medicinal compounds were first discovered in plants and then synthesized artificially. However, researchers have investigated fewer than 5,000 plant species as potential sources of medicine. Pharmaceutical companies were led to most of these species by local people who use the plants in preparing their traditional medicines.

TABLE 2.2, p. 37.The tropical rain forest may be a medicine chest of healing plants that could be extinct before we even know they exist. This is only one reason to value what is left of plant diversity and to search for ways to slow the loss. The solutions we propose must be economically realistic. If the goal is only profit for the short term, then we will continue to slash and burn until the forests are gone. If, however, we begin to see rain forests and other ecosystems as living treasures that can regenerate only slowly, we may learn to harvest their products at sustainable rates. What else can we do to preserve plant diversity? Few questions are as important.

EVOLUTION OF FUNGI

   Fungi colonized land with plants

   Fungi and animals evolved from a common protistan ancestor

The words fungus and mold may evoke some unpleasant images. Fungi rot timbers, attack living plants, spoil food, and afflict humans with athlete's foot and worse maladies. However, ecosystems would be in trouble without fungi to decompose dead organisms, fallen leaves, feces, and other organic materials, thus recycling vital chemical elements back to the environment in forms other organisms can assimilate. Most plants depend on mutualistic fungi that help their roots absorb minerals and water from the soil. In addition to these ecological roles, fungi have been used by humans in various ways for centuries. We eat some fungi (mushrooms, for instance), culture fungi to produce antibiotics and other drugs, add them to dough to make bread rise, and use them to ferment beer and wine. Many fungi are also quite colorful and beautiful, as you can see from Mary Elizabeth Banning's 19th-century watercolor of indigo milk cap (Lactarius indigo). Whatever our initial subjective perceptions may be, fungi are fascinating as objects of study. They are a form of life so distinctive that they have been accorded their own taxonomic kingdom.

In this chapter we will characterize the members of the kingdom Fungi, survey their diversity, discuss their ecological and commercial impact, and consider hypotheses about their evolutionary origin. As we did with the plant kingdom, we will look in some detail at life cycles, mainly for what they tell us about the phylogeny and evolutionary adaptations of fungi.

 Many fungi have a heterokaryotic stage



Fungi are eukaryotes, and most are multicellular. Although fungi were once grouped with plants, they are unique organisms that generally differ from other eukaryotes in nutritional mode, structural organization, growth, and reproduction. In fact, molecular studies indicate that animals, not plants, are the closest relatives of fungi (see FIGURE 28.8).

Fig 31-4. Phylogeny of fungi. This phylogenetic tree, supported primarily by molecular evidence, indicates probable evolutionary relationships among the four phyla of the kingdom Fungi. Representing the oldest lineage of fungi, the chytrids are mainly aquatic and have flagellated cells. Fungi in the other three phyla lack flagellated stages.

EVOLUTION OF FUNGI

 Fungi and animals evolved from a common protistan ancestor







 Absorptive nutrition enables fungi to live as decomposers and symbionts

Fungi are heterotrophs that acquire their nutrients by absorption. In this mode of nutrition, small organic molecules are absorbed from the surrounding medium. A fungus digests food outside its body by secreting powerful hydrolytic enzymes into the food. These exoenzymes, as they are called, decompose complex molecules to the simpler compounds that the fungus can absorb and use.

The absorptive mode of nutrition is associated with the ecological roles of fungi as decomposers (saprobes), parasites, or mutualistic symbionts. Saprobic fungi absorb nutrients from nonliving organic material, such as fallen logs, animal corpses, or the wastes of live organisms. In the process of this saprobic nutrition, fungi decompose the organic material. Parasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells of living hosts. Some of these fungi, such as certain species infecting the lungs of humans, are pathogenic. Pathogenic fungi cause about 80%  of plant diseases. Mutualistic fungi also absorb nutrients from a host organism, but they reciprocate with functions beneficial to their partners in some way, such as aiding a plant in the uptake of minerals from the soil.





 Extensive surface area and rapid growth adapt fungi for absorptive nutrition

The vegetative (nutritionally active) bodies of most fungi are usually hidden, being diffusely organized around and within the tissues of their food sources. Except for yeasts, which are unicellular, the bodies of fungi are constructed of tiny filaments called hyphae (singular, hypha). Hyphae are composed of tubular walls surrounding plasma membranes and cytoplasm. The hyphae form an interwoven mat called a mycelium (plural, mycelia), the "feeding" network of a fungus (FIGURE 31.1).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 31-1. Fungal mycelia.

Fungal mycelia can be huge, although they usually escape our notice--because they are subterranean, for instance. In 2000, scientists discovered the mycelium of one giant individual of the fungus Armillaria ostoyae in Oregon that is 3.4 miles in diameter and spreads through 2,200 acres of forest, equivalent to over 1,600 football fields. This fungus is at least 2,400 years old and hundreds of tons in weight, qualifying it as one of Earth's oldest and largest organisms.

Most fungi are multicellular with hyphae divided into cells by cross-walls, or septa (singular, septum). The septa generally have pores large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria, and even nuclei to flow from cell to cell (FIGURE 31.2a, p. 618). The cell walls of fungi differ from the cellulose walls of plants. Most fungi build their cell walls mainly of chitin, a strong but flexible nitrogen-containing polysaccharide identical to the chitin found in the external skeletons of insects and other arthropods. Some fungi are aseptate; that is, their hyphae are not divided into cells by cross-walls. Known as coenocytic fungi, they consist of a continuous cytoplasmic mass with hundreds or thousands of nuclei (FIGURE 31.2b). The coenocytic condition results from the repeated division of nuclei without cytoplasmic division. Parasitic fungi usually have some of their hyphae modified as haustoria, nutrient-absorbing hyphal tips that penetrate the tissues of the host (FIGURE 31.2c). There are even fungi with hyphae adapted for preying on animals (FIGURE 31.2d).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 31-2. Examples of fungal hyphae.

The correlation between structure and function is a fundamental theme of biology. The filamentous structure of the mycelium provides an extensive surface area that suits the absorptive nutrition of fungi. Ten cubic centimeters of rich organic soil may contain as much as 1 km of hyphae having a fungal surface area of over 300 cm2 interfacing with the soil.

A fungal mycelium grows rapidly, adding as much as a kilometer of hyphae each day as it branches throughout a food source. Such fast growth is possible because proteins and other materials synthesized by the entire mycelium are channeled by cytoplasmic streaming to the tips of the extending hyphae. The fungus concentrates its energy and resources on adding hyphal length and thus overall absorptive surface area, rather than girth. Fungal mycelia are nonmotile; they cannot run, swim, or fly in search of food or mates. But the mycelium makes up for the lack of mobility by swiftly extending the tips of its hyphae into new territory.





 Fungi disperse and reproduce by releasing spores that are produced sexually or asexually

Fungi reproduce by releasing spores that are produced either sexually or asexually. The output of spores is enormous. For example, puffballs, which are reproductive structures of certain fungi, can puff out clouds containing trillions of spores (see FIGURE 22.8). Carried by wind or water, spores germinate to produce mycelia if they land in a moist place where there is food. Spores thus function in dispersal and account for the wide geographic distribution of many species of fungi. The airborne spores of fungi have even been found more than 160km (100 miles) above Earth. Closer to home, try leaving a slice of bread out for a week or two and you will observe the furry mycelia that grow from the invisible spores raining down from the surrounding air.





 Many fungi have a heterokaryotic stage





The nuclei of fungal hyphae and spores of most species are haploid, except for transient diploid stages that form during sexual life cycles. However, some mycelia may become genetically heterogeneous through the fusion of two hyphae that have genetically different nuclei. Such a mycelium is said to be a heterokaryon, meaning "different nuclei." In some cases, the different nuclei stay in separate parts of the same mycelium, which is then a mosaic in terms of genotype and phenotype. In other cases, the different nuclei mingle and may even exchange chromosomes and genes in a process similar to crossing over. This heterokaryon condition has some of the advantages of diploidy; one haploid genome may be able to compensate for harmful mutations in the other nucleus, and vice versa.

In many fungi with sexual life cycles, the union of partners occurs in two distinct stages called plasmogamy and karyogamy (FIGURE 31.3). First comes plasmogamy, the fusion of the two parents' cytoplasm when their mycelia come together. The second stage, karyogamy, is the fusion of the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents. Plasmogamy and karyogamy may be separated in time by hours, days, or even years or centuries. During the interim, the hybrid mycelium exists as a heterokaryon, its haploid nuclei still separate. In some fungi, the haploid nuclei pair off, two to a cell, one from each parent. Such a mycelium, a special case of a heterokaryon, is said to be dikaryotic, meaning "two nuclei." Without fusing, the two nuclei in each cell divide in tandem as the mycelium grows, until karyogamy finally occurs. In most fungi, the zygotes or transient structures formed by karyogamy are the only diploid stages in the life cycle. Meiosis restores the haploid condition before specialized reproductive structures of the mycelium produce and disperse spores. Of course, the sexual processes of karyogamy and meiosis have generated genetic variation, upon which adaptive evolution depends (see Chapters 13 and 23 to review sex as a mechanism that increases genetic diversity within a population).

 Phylum Chytridiomycota: Chytrids may provide clues about fungal origins

The chytrids are mainly aquatic. Some are saprobes; others parasitize protists, plants, and animals. Parasitic chytrids may be contributing to a worldwide decline in the number of amphibians.

Until recently, some systematists emphasized the absence of flagellated cells as a membership requirement for the kingdom Fungi. By that criterion, chytrids were excluded and placed instead in the kingdom Protista (of the five-kingdom system) because they form uniflagellated spores called zoospores (FIGURE 31.5, p. 620). However, in the past decade, molecular systematists comparing the sequences of proteins and nucleic acids uncovered strong support for including the chytrids with the fungi as a monophyletic branch of the eukaryotic tree (see FIGURE 31.4). Other key fungal characteristics of chytrids are an absorptive mode of nutrition and cell walls made of chitin. Most chytrids form coenocytic hyphae, although some are unicellular. Chytrids also have some key enzymes and metabolic pathways that are common among fungi but are not found in the so-called funguslike protists (slime molds and water molds; see Chapter 28).

Fig 31-5. Chytridiomycota (chytrids). The branched hyphae of Chytridium expose a large surface to the surrounding medium, from which the organism absorbs nutrients. Chytrids are the only fungi with a flagellated stage, the zoospore shown in the inset (TEM).

Molecular evidence also supports the hypothesis that chytrids are the most primitive fungi, meaning that they belong to the lineage that diverged earliest in the phylogeny of fungi. A reasonable extension of this hypothesis is that fungi evolved from protists that had flagella, a feature retained in the fungal kingdom only by the chytrids.





 Phylum Zygomycota: Zygote fungi form resistant structures during sexual reproduction





Mycologists have described about 600 zygomycetes, or zygote fungi. (The suffix -mycete, which occurs many times in this chapter, means "fungus.") These fungi are mostly terrestrial and live in soil or on decaying plant and animal material. One group of major importance forms mycorrhizae, mutualistic associations with the roots of plants (see FIGURE 31.18). Zygomycete hyphae are coenocytic, with septa found only where reproductive cells are formed.

Fig 31-18. Mycorrhizae. Mutualistic associations between fungi and roots, mycorrhizae enhance the absorption of minerals. This scanning electron micrograph of fungal hyphae on a small root of a eucalyptus reveals the intimate association between the symbiotic partners of mycorrhizae. Some mycorrhizal fungi surround the living cells of the root, while others actually penetrate the root cells.

A common zygomycete is black bread mold, Rhizopus stolonifer, still an occasional household pest despite the addition of preservatives to most processed foods (FIGURE 31.6). Horizontal hyphae spread out over the food, penetrate it, and absorb nutrients. In the asexual phase, bulbous black sporangia develop at the tips of upright hyphae. Within each sporangium, hundreds of haploid spores develop and are dispersed through the air. Spores that happen to land on moist food germinate, growing into new mycelia. If environmental conditions deteriorate--for instance, if all the food is used up--this species of Rhizopus reproduces sexually. The parents in a sexual union are mycelia of opposite mating types, identical in appearance but different in the chemical markers that mates recognize. Plasmogamy produces a resistant structure called a zygosporangium, in which karyogamy and then meiosis occur (FIGURE 31.7). Note that a zygosporangium, while representing the zygote (2n) stage in the life cycle, is not a zygote in the usual sense of a cell with one diploid nucleus. Rather, the zygosporangium is a multinucleate structure, first heterokaryotic with many nuclei from the two parents, then with many diploid nuclei after karyogamy.

		Mycelia of Rhizopus can also reproduce asexually by forming sporangia (lower left LM) that produce genetically identical haploid spores.

The zygosporangia, for which zygomycetes are named, are resistant to freezing and drying and are metabolically inactive. When conditions improve, the zygosporangia release genetically diverse haploid spores that colonize the new substrate. Some zygomycetes, such as Pilobolus, can actually aim their spores (FIGURE 31.8).

The fungus then shoots its sporangia like cannonballs; they can land and stick to grass as far as 2 m away. Grazing animals such as cows scatter the spores in feces.





 Phylum Ascomycota: Sac fungi produce sexual spores in saclike asci





Mycologists have described over 60,000 species of ascomycetes, or sac fungi, from a variety of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. They range in size and complexity from unicellular yeasts to minute leaf-spot fungi to elaborate cup fungi and morels (FIGURE 31.9). Ascomycetes include some of the most devastating plant pathogens, which will be discussed later in the chapter. However, many are important saprobes, particularly of plant material. About half the ascomycete species live with algae in the mutualistic associations called lichens. Some ascomycetes form mycorrhizae with plants. Others live between mesophyll cells in leaves, apparently helping to protect the plant tissues from insects by releasing toxic compounds.

Fig 31-9. Ascomycetes (sac fungi). The "fruiting" (sexual) structures of ascomycetes are called ascocarps.

The defining feature of the Ascomycota is the production of sexual spores in saclike asci (singular, ascus). Unlike the zygote fungi, most sac fungi bear their sexual stages in macroscopic fruiting bodies, or ascocarps. The spore-forming asci are found in the ascocarps.

Ascomycetes reproduce asexually by producing enormous numbers of asexual spores, which are often dispersed by wind. The asexual spores are produced externally at the tips of specialized hyphae called conidiophores, often in long chains or clusters. These spores are not formed inside sporangia, as in the Zygomycota. Such naked spores are called conidia, from the Greek for "dust."

Compared to zygomycetes, ascomycetes are characterized by a more extensive heterokaryotic stage, which is associated with the formation of ascocarps (FIGURE 31.10). Plasmogamy between specialized regions of two parental hyphae produces a heterokaryotic bulge called the ascogonium. The coenocytic ascogonium extends hyphae partitioned by septa into dikaryotic cells, each with two haploid nuclei representing the two parental mycelia. It is the cells at the tips of these dikaryotic hyphae that develop into asci. Within an ascus, karyogamy combines the two parental genomes, and then meiosis forms four genetically varied ascospores. One mitotic division doubles the ascospore number to eight. In many asci, the eight ascospores are lined up in a row in the order in which they formed from a single zygotic nucleus. This arrangement provides geneticists with a unique opportunity to study genetic recombination. Genetic differences between mycelia grown from ascospores taken from one ascus reflect crossing over and independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.

		 Haploid mycelia of opposite mating types become intertwined and form an ascogonium and an antheridium. 
			  
		A cytoplasmic bridge forms, allowing plasmogamy (cytoplasmic fusion) to occur. The ascogonium acts as a "female," receiving haploid nuclei from the "male" antheridium. The ascogonium then has a pool of nuclei from both parents, but karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) does not occur at this time. 
			  
		 The ascogonium gives rise to dikaryotic hyphae that are incorporated into an ascocarp, the cup of a cup fungus (see FIGURE 31.9a). 
			  
		The tips of the ascocarp's dikaryotic hyphae are partitioned into asci (singular, ascus). 
			  
		Karyogamy occurs within these asci, and the diploid nucleus divides by meiosis, 
			  
		yielding four haploid nuclei. 
			  
		Each of these haploid nuclei divides once by mitosis, and the ascus now contains eight nuclei. Cell walls develop around these nuclei to form ascospores. (The LM shows a mature ascus with eight ascospores.) 
			  
		When mature, all ascospores in an ascus are dispersed at once out the end of the ascus. A collapsing ascus jars neighboring asci and causes them to release their spores. The chain reaction releases a visible cloud of spores with an audible hiss. 
			  
		Germinating ascospores give rise to new haploid mycelia. 
			  
		Ascomycetes can also reproduce asexually by producing airborne spores called conidia.





 Phylum Basidiomycota: Club fungi have long-lived dikaryotic mycelia

Approximately 25,000 fungi, including mushrooms, shelf fungi, puffballs, and rusts, are classified in the phylum Basidiomycota (FIGURE 31.11). The name derives from the basidium (L., "little pedestal"), a transient diploid stage in the organism's life cycle. The clublike shape of the basidium also gives rise to the common name club fungus.

Fig 31-11. Basidiomycetes (club fungi). These photographs showcase diverse basidiocarps, the fruiting bodies that produce sexual spores.

Basidiomycetes are important decomposers of wood and other plant material. The phylum also includes mycorrhiza-forming mutualists and plant parasites. Of all fungi, the saprobic basidiomycetes are best at decomposing the complex polymer lignin, an abundant component of wood. Many shelf fungi (FIGURE 31.11b) break down the wood of weak or damaged trees and continue to decompose the wood after the trees die. Two groups of basidiomycetes, the rusts and smuts, include particularly destructive plant parasites.

The life cycle of a club fungus usually includes a long-lived dikaryotic mycelium (FIGURE 31.12). Periodically, in response to environmental stimuli, this mycelium reproduces sexually by producing elaborate fruiting bodies called basidiocarps (see FIGURE 31.11). The numerous basidia of a basidiocarp are the sources of sexual spores. Asexual reproduction in basidiomycetes is much less common than in ascomycetes.

		Two haploid mycelia of opposite mating type undergo plasmogamy, 
			  
		creating a dikaryotic mycelium that grows faster than, and ultimately crowds out, the parent haploid mycelia. 
			  
		Environmental cues such as rain or temperature changes induce the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses that develop into basidiocarps (mushrooms, in this case). Cytoplasm streaming in from the mycelium swells the hyphae of mushrooms, causing them to "pop up" overnight. The dikaryotic mycelia of basidiomycetes are long-lived, generally producing a new crop of basidiocarps each year. 
			  
		The surfaces of the basidiocarp's gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia. 
			  
		Karyogamy produces diploid nuclei, which then undergo meiosis, 
			  
		each yielding four haploid nuclei. Each basidium grows four appendages, and one haploid nucleus enters each appendage and develops into a basidiospore (SEM inset). 
			  
		When mature, the basidiospores are propelled slightly (by electrostatic forces) into the spaces between the gills. After the spores drop below the cap, they are dispersed by the wind. 
			  
		The haploid basidiospores germinate in a suitable environment and grow into short-lived haploid mycelia.

A mushroom is an example of a basidiocarp. The cap of the mushroom supports and protects a large surface area of basidia on gills; each common, store-bought mushroom has a gill surface area of about 200 cm2. Such a mushroom may release a billion basidiospores, which drop beneath the cap and are blown away.

By concentrating growth in the hyphae of mushrooms, a basidiomycete mycelium can erect the fruiting structures in just a few hours. A ring of mushrooms, popularly called a fairy ring, may appear on a lawn overnight (FIGURE 31.13). Although the grass in the center of the ring is normal, you may notice after a few days that the grass beneath the ring is stunted and the grass just outside the garland of mushrooms is especially lush. As the underground mycelium grows outward, its center portion and the mushrooms above the center portion die because the mycelium has consumed all the available nutrients. Thus, the living mycelium is an expanding ring that produces mushrooms above it. The grass beneath the mushrooms is stunted because it cannot compete for minerals with the active mycelium. But the advancing mycelium secretes digestive agents ahead of it that decompose the organic matter in the soil, producing a lush growth of grass that absorbs the minerals that have become available. The fairy ring slowly increases in diameter as the mycelium advances at a rate of about 30 cm per year. Some giant fairy rings may be centuries old.

Afterward, the tired fairies sit down on the mushrooms, but some of the mushrooms are sat on by toads. The mushrooms the fairies choose are edible by humans, but the "toadstools" are poisonous. See the text on page 624 to read an alternate explanation of fairy rings.

TABLE 31.1 on page 626 reviews the four phyla of fungi. Let's now turn to a different way of classifying certain fungi.

 Molds, yeasts, lichens, and mycorrhizae are specialized lifestyles that evolved independently in diverse fungal phyla

Certain ways of living that require both morphological and ecological adaptations have evolved independently among the zygote fungi, sac fungi, and club fungi. This section explores four fungal forms with highly specialized ways of life: molds, yeasts, lichens, and mycorrhizae.

Molds

Mention of fungi may bring the ubiquitous molds to mind. A mold is a rapidly growing, asexually reproducing fungus. The mycelia of these fungi grow as saprobes or parasites on a great variety of substrates. You are already familiar with one example, bread mold (Rhizopus; see FIGURE 31.6). Molds may go through a series of different reproductive stages. Early in life, a mold produces asexual spores. The term mold applies only to these asexual stages (FIGURE 31.14). Later, the same fungus may reproduce sexually, producing zygosporangia, ascocarps, or basidiocarps.

Fig 31-14. A moldy orange."Blue mold" is usually caused by a species of Penicillium, an ascomycete. This mold reproduces asexually by producing chains of conidia on hyphae called conidiophores (right, SEM).

There are also molds that cannot be classified as zygomycetes, ascomycetes, or basidiomycetes because they have no known sexual stages. Those molds are collectively called deuteromycetes, or imperfect fungi (from the botanical use of the term perfect to refer to the sexual stages of life cycles). Imperfect fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. Note that this is an informal grouping without phylogenetic basis. Whenever a mycologist discovers a sexual stage in one of these fungi, the species is moved from the imperfect category to a particular phylum, depending on the type of sexual structures.

Yeasts

Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit liquid or moist habitats, including plant sap and animal tissues. Yeasts reproduce asexually, by simple cell division or by the pinching of small "bud cells" off a parent cell (FIGURE 31.15). Some yeasts reproduce sexually, by forming asci or basidia, and are classified as Ascomycota or Basidiomycota. Others are placed in the imperfect fungi because no sexual stages are known. Some fungi can grow as either single cells (yeasts) or as a filamentous mycelium, depending on the availability of nutrients.

Fig 31-15. Budding yeast. This micrograph shows Saccharomyces cerevisiae in various stages of budding (SEM).

Humans have used yeasts to raise bread and ferment alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. Only relatively recently have the yeasts involved been separated into pure culture for more controlled human use. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ascomycete, is the most important of all domesticated fungi (see FIGURE 31.15). The tiny yeast cells, available as many strains of baker's yeast and brewer's yeast, are very active metabolically. The cells release small bubbles of CO2 that leaven dough. Cultured anaerobically in breweries and wineries, Saccharomyces ferments sugars to alcohol. Researchers use Saccharomyces to study the molecular genetics of eukaryotes because these microbes are easy to culture and manipulate (see Chapter 19).

Some yeasts cause problems for humans. A pink yeast, Rhodotorula, grows on shower curtains and other moist surfaces in our homes. Another yeast is Candida, one of the normal inhabitants of moist human epithelial tissue, such as the vaginal lining. Certain circumstances can cause Candida to become pathogenic by growing too rapidly and releasing harmful substances ("yeast infections"). This can occur, for example, with an environmental change such as a pH shift, or when the immune system of the human host is compromised--by AIDS, for instance.

Lichens

At a distance, lichens are often mistaken for mosses or other simple plants growing on rocks, rotting logs, trees, and roofs (FIGURE 31.16). In fact, lichens are not mosses or any other kind of plant, nor are they even individual organisms. A lichen is a symbiotic association of millions of photosynthetic microorganisms held in a mesh of fungal hyphae. The fungal component is most commonly an ascomycete, but several basidiomycete lichens are known. The photosynthetic partners are usually unicellular or filamentous green algae or cyanobacteria. The merger of fungus and alga is so complete that lichens are actually given genus and species names, as though they were single organisms. Over 25,000 species have been described.

The fungus usually gives the lichen its overall shape and structure, and tissues formed by hyphae account for most of the lichen's mass. The algal component usually occupies an inner layer below the lichen surface (FIGURE 31.17). In most cases that have been examined, each partner provides things the other could not obtain on its own. The alga provides the fungus with food. Cyanobacteria in lichens fix nitrogen (see Chapter 27) and provide organic nitrogen. The fungus provides the alga with a suitable physical environment for growth. Lichens absorb most of the minerals they need either from dust in the air or from rain. The physical arrangement of hyphae retains water and minerals, allows for gas exchange, and protects the algae. Fungal pigments help shade the algae from intense sunlight. Some fungal compounds are toxic and prevent lichens from being eaten by consumers. The fungi also secrete acids, which aid in the uptake of minerals.

Fig 31-17. Anatomy of a lichen.

The fungi of many lichens reproduce sexually by forming ascocarps or basidiocarps. Lichen algae reproduce independently of the fungus by asexual cell division. As might be expected of "dual organisms," asexual reproduction as symbiotic units also occurs commonly, either by fragmentation of the parental lichen or by the formation of specialized structures called soredia (see FIGURE 31.17). Soredia are small clusters of hyphae with embedded algae.

The nature of the lichen symbiosis is complex and is probably best described as mutual exploitation instead of mutual benefit. Lichens are able to live in environments where neither fungi nor algae could live alone. While the fungal components do not grow alone in the wild, some lichen algae also occur as free-living organisms. The fungi and algae of some lichens have been experimentally separated and cultured. Such cultures look like free-living molds and algae; the cultured fungi do not produce lichen compounds, and the cultured lichen algae do not "leak" carbohydrates from their cells as they do in lichens. In some lichens, the fungus invades the algal cells with haustoria and may kill some of them, though not as fast as the alga replenishes its numbers by reproduction.

Lichens are important pioneers on newly cleared rock and soil surfaces, such as burned forests and volcanic flows. Physical penetration of the outer crystals of rocks and chemical attack of rock by lichen acids help break down the rock and establish soil-trapping lichens. This process makes it possible for a succession of plants to grow. Nitrogen-fixing lichens also add organic nitrogen to some ecosystems.

Some lichens tolerate severe cold. In the arctic tundra, herds of caribou and reindeer graze on carpets of reindeer lichen (reindeer "moss") at times of the year when other foods are unavailable. Lichens can also survive desiccation. When it is foggy or rainy, lichens may absorb more than ten times their weight in water. Photosynthesis begins almost immediately when the water content reaches 65%  to 75% . In dry air, lichens rapidly dehydrate, and photosynthesis stops. Thus, in arid climates lichens grow very slowly, often less than a millimeter per year. Some lichens are thousands of years old, rivaling the oldest plants as the elder organisms on Earth.

As tough as lichens are, many do not stand up very well to air pollution. Their passive mode of mineral uptake from rain and moist air makes them particularly sensitive to sulfur dioxide and other aerial poisons. The death of sensitive lichens and an increase in hardier species in an area can be an early warning that air quality is deteriorating.

Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizae are mutualistic associations of plant roots and fungi. The word mycorrhizae means "fungus roots," referring to the structures formed by both root cells and hyphae from the associated fungus (FIGURE 31.18). The anatomy of this symbiosis varies, depending on the type of fungus. The extensions of the fungal mycelium from the hyphae forming the mycorrhizae greatly increase the absorptive surface of the plant roots. The partners exchange minerals accumulated from the soil by the fungus for organic nutrients synthesized by the plant.

Mycorrhizae are enormously important in natural ecosystems and agriculture (FIGURE 31.19). Almost all vascular plants have mycorrhizae. The fungi involved are permanent associates with their hosts and periodically form fruiting bodies (structures for sexual reproduction). Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota all have members that form mycorrhizae. In fact, almost half of all species of mushroom-forming basidiomycetes live as mycorrhizae with oak, birch, and pine trees. The mushrooms that sprout around the bases of these trees are the surface evidence of the underground symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. (The structure and physiology of mycorrhizae are described in more detail in Chapter 36.)

It represents an experimental group of plants that researchers grew in soil treated with fungicide (poison that kills fungi). The plant's growth is stunted, probably due to a phosphorus deficiency. The plant on the right is from a control group with mycorrhizae, which enhance the uptake of phosphate and other minerals.





 Ecosystems depend on fungi as decomposers and symbionts

Fungi and bacteria are the principal decomposers that keep ecosystems stocked with the inorganic nutrients essential for plant growth. Without decomposers, carbon, nitrogen, and other elements would become tied up in organic matter. Plants and the animals they feed would starve because elements taken from the soil would not be returned (see Chapter 54).

Fungi are well adapted as decomposers of plant material. Their invasive hyphae enter the tissues and cells of dead organic matter, secreting exoenzymes that hydrolyze polymers, including the cellulose and lignin of plant cell walls. A succession of fungi, in concert with bacteria and, in some environments, invertebrate animals, are responsible for the complete breakdown of plant litter. The air is so loaded with fungal spores that as soon as a leaf falls or an insect dies, it is covered with spores and is soon infiltrated by saprobic hyphae.

We may applaud fungi that decompose forest litter or dung, but it is a different story when molds attack our fruit or our shower curtains. Between 10%  and 50%  of the world's fruit harvest is lost each year to fungal attack. Ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, also stimulates fungal spores on the fruit surface to germinate. This timing mechanism allows fungi to invade when fruit is most vulnerable and nutritious. A wood-digesting saprobe does not distinguish between a fallen oak limb and the oak planks of a boat. During the Revolutionary War, the British lost more ships to fungal rot than to enemy attack. Soldiers stationed in the tropics during World War II watched their tents, clothing, boots, and binoculars be destroyed by molds. Some fungi can even decompose certain plastics.





 Some fungi are pathogens

Of the 100,000 known species of fungi, about 30%  make their living as parasites, mostly on or in plants. For example, Ophiostoma ulmi, the ascomycete that causes Dutch elm disease, has drastically changed the landscape of the northeastern United States (FIGURE 31.20a). Accidentally introduced to the United States on logs that were sent from Europe to help pay World War I debts, the fungus is carried from tree to tree by bark beetles. Another ascomycete, Cryphonectria parasitica, has almost eliminated the native American chestnut. Fungi are also serious agricultural pests. Some species infect grain crops and cause tremendous economic losses each year. For example, the basidiomycete Puccinia graminis causes wheat rust (FIGURE 31.20b).

Fig 31-20. Examples of fungal diseases of plants.

Some of the fungi that attack food crops are toxic to humans. For example, some species of the mold Aspergillus contaminate improperly stored grain and peanuts by secreting compounds called aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic. In another example, one type of ascomycete, Clavicepspurpurea, forms purple structures called ergots on rye (FIGURE 31.20c). If diseased rye is inadvertently milled into flour and consumed, poisons from the ergots cause gangrene, nervous spasms, burning sensations, hallucinations, and temporary insanity. One epidemic in about 944 A.D. killed more than 40,000 people in France. One of the hallucinogens that has been isolated from ergots is lysergic acid, the raw material from which LSD is made. On the other hand, toxins extracted from fungi often have medicinal uses when administered in weak doses. For example, an ergot compound is helpful in treating high blood pressure and stopping maternal bleeding after childbirth.

Animals are much less susceptible to parasitic fungi than are plants. Only about 50 species of fungi are known to be parasitic in humans and other animals. Their damage to hosts, however, is disproportionately large compared to their taxonomic diversity. In humans, fungi cause infections ranging from annoyances such as athlete's foot to deadly lung diseases.

The general term for a fungal infection is mycosis. Skin mycoses include the disease ringworm, so named because it appears as circular red areas on the skin. The ascomycetes that cause ringworm can infect almost any skin surface. Most commonly, they grow on the feet, causing the intense itching and blisters known as athlete's foot. Though highly contagious, athlete's foot and other ringworm infections can be treated with various fungicidal lotions and powders. Systemic mycoses, usually very serious, are fungal infections that spread throughout the body, usually from spores that are inhaled. Two examples are histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, which are both very serious diseases with tuberculosis-like symptoms. The yeast Candida albicans is an example of an opportunistic pathogen. That means it is a normal inhabitant of the human body that only causes problems such as vaginal yeast infections when some other change in the body's microbiology, chemistry, or immunology allows the yeast to grow unchecked. Opportunistic infections, including mycoses, have increased in the past few decades, partly because of AIDS, which compromises the immune system.





 Fungi are commercially important

It would not be fair to fungi to end our discussion with an account of diseases. Far more important are the benefits we derive from these interesting eukaryotes. We depend on them as decomposers and recyclers of organic matter.

Fungi also have a number of practical uses for humans. Most of us have eaten mushrooms, although we may not have realized that we were ingesting the fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) of subterranean fungi. And mushrooms are not the only fungi we eat. The distinctive flavors of certain kinds of cheeses, including Roquefort and blue cheese, come from the fungi used to ripen them. The soft drink industry uses a species of the ascomycete mold Aspergillus to produce citric acid for colas. Highly prized by gourmets are truffles, the fruiting bodies of certain mycorrhizal ascomycetes associated with tree roots (see FIGURE 31.9b). Their complex flavor is variously described as nutty, musky, cheesy, or all three. The fruiting bodies (ascocarps) release strong odors that attract mammal and insect consumers that excavate the truffles and disperse their spores. In some cases, the odors mimic sex attractants of certain mammals. Truffle hunters traditionally used pigs to locate their prizes, although dogs are now more commonly used.

More important in food production are unicellular fungi, the yeasts. As discussed on page 627, yeasts are used in baking, brewing, and winemaking. Fungi are medically valuable as well. Some fungi produce antibiotics used to treat bacterial diseases. In fact, the first antibiotic discovered was penicillin, made by the common mold Penicillium (FIGURE 31.21).

 Fungi colonized land with plants

The fossil record indicates that from their inception, terrestrial communities have been dependent on fungi as decomposers and symbionts. Much of the diversity of fungi we observe today may have had its phylogenetic origin in adaptive radiation when life began to colonize land. The oldest undisputed fossils of fungi date back 460 million years, about the time plants began to colonize land. Fossils of the first vascular plants from the late Silurian period have petrified mycorrhizae. Plants probably moved onto land in the company of fungi.

Molecular evidence supports the widely held view that the four fungal divisions are monophyletic (see FIGURE 31.4). The occurrence of flagella in the chytrids, representing the oldest lineage of fungi, indicates that fungal ancestors were aquatic flagellated organisms. Flagellated cells were probably lost in the chytrid lineage that led to the Zygomycota, as ancestral fungi became increasingly adapted for life on land. Many of the differences among the phyla Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota represent different solutions to the problem of reproducing and dispersing on land. These fungi may have diverged during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.





 Fungi and animals evolved from a common protistan ancestor

Animals probably evolved from aquatic flagellated organisms too, and there is compelling evidence that animals and fungi diverged from a common protistan ancestor. Comparisons of several proteins and ribosomal RNA indicate that fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants (see FIGURE 28.8). We discuss animal phylogeny in more detail in Chapter 32.

Animal life began in Precambrian seas with the evolution of multicellular forms that lived by eating other organisms. This new way of life allowed the exploitation of previously untapped resources and led to an evolutionary radiation of diverse forms. Early animals populated the seas, fresh water, and eventually the land. In the above photo of a coral reef, the diver, the fish, and the various invertebrates (animals without backbones) are just a few examples of the diverse forms derived during the past half-billion years of animal evolution.

This chapter begins with the general characteristics of animals. We then discuss possible relationships among the animal phyla and examine hypotheses about the origin and early diversification of animals. This overview provides an orientation for our closer look at animal phyla in the next two chapters.

 Molecular systematists are moving some branches around on the phylogenetic tree of animals



Zoologists recognize about 35 phyla of animals, though our survey of animal diversity will include only 15 of these major animal groups. For the past century, there was broad consensus among systematists for at least the major branching in a hypothetical tree of the animal kingdom. This traditional tree was based mainly on the anatomical features of the animals and on certain details of their embryonic development. However, the molecular systematics of the past decade is challenging some of these long-held ideas about the phylogenetic relationships among the animal phyla.

Throughout this unit of chapters on the diversity of life, we have seen many cases where molecular data are enabling systematists to refine hypotheses about the history of life. Just a few examples are the splitting of prokaryotes into the archaea and the bacteria (Chapter 27), the reassessment of phylogenetic relationships among the protists (Chapter 28), reinforcement of the hypothesis that plants descended from the green algae called charophyceans (Chapter 29), progress in identifying the major clades (evolutionary branches) of flowering plants (Chapter 30), and the revelation that Fungi is the kingdom most closely related to the animal kingdom (Chapter 31). Thus, it probably doesn't surprise you that molecular systematics is beginning to reshape our view of animal diversity.

 Structure, nutrition, and life history define animals

Constructing a good definition of an animal is not as easy as it might first appear. There are exceptions to nearly every criterion for distinguishing an animal from other life forms. However, when taken together, the following characteristics of animals will serve our purposes.

Animals are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes. In contrast to the autotrophic nutrition of plants and algae, animals must take into their bodies preformed organic molecules; they cannot construct them from inorganic chemicals. Most animals do this by ingestion--eating other organisms or organic material that is decomposing.

Animal cells lack the cell walls that provide strong support in the bodies of plants and fungi. The multicellular bodies of animals are held together by structural proteins, the most abundant being collagen (see FIGURES 7.29 and 40.2). In addition to collagen, which is found mainly in extracellular matrices, animal tissues have unique types of intercellular junctions--tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions--that are composed of other structural proteins (see FIGURE 7.30).

Also unique among animals are two types of tissues responsible for impulse conduction and movement: nervous tissue and muscle tissue.

A few key features of life history also distinguish animals. Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage usually dominating the life cycle. In most species, a small flagellated sperm fertilizes a larger, nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote. The zygote then undergoes cleavage, a succession of mitotic cell divisions. During the development of most animals, cleavage leads to the formation of a multicellular stage called a blastula, which in many animals takes the form of a hollow ball. Following the blastula stage is the process of gastrulation, during which layers of embryonic tissues that will develop into adult body parts are produced. The resulting developmental stage is called a gastrula (FIGURE 32.1). Some animals develop directly through transient stages of maturation into adults, but the life cycles of many animals include larval stages. The larva is a sexually immature form. It is morphologically distinct from the adult stage, usually eats different food, and may even have a different habitat than the adult, as in the case of a frog tadpole. Animal larvae eventually undergo metamorphosis, a resurgence of development that transforms the animal into an adult.

Fig 32-1. Early embryonic development.

The transformation of a zygote to an animal of specific form depends on the controlled expression in the developing embryo of special regulatory genes called Hox genes. All eukaryotes have genes that regulate the expression of other genes. And many of these regulatory genes contain common "modules" of DNA sequences called homeoboxes. But among eukaryotes outside the animal kingdom, homeoboxes are not found in homeotic genes, those regulatory genes that function in the development of body form. (You can review homeoboxes, homeotic genes, and pattern formation in Chapter 21.) So far, genes that are both homeobox-containing in structure and homeotic in function--Hox genes--have been discovered only in animals. And all animals, from the simplest sponges to the most complex insects and vertebrates, have Hox genes containing homeoboxes of DNA sequences that are clearly related (see FIGURE 21.15). In general, the number of Hox genes is correlated with the complexity of the animal's anatomy. More specifically, variation in when and where the various Hox genes are expressed in a developing embryo provides the genetic basis for the great diversity of animal forms that have evolved from a common ancestor.





 The animal kingdom probably evolved from a colonial, flagellated protist

Most systematists now agree that the animal kingdom is monophyletic; that is, if we could trace all animal lineages back to their origin, they would converge on a common ancestor. That ancestor was most likely a colonial flagellated protist that lived over 700 million years ago in the Precambrian era. This protist was probably related to choanoflagellates, a group that arose about a billion years ago. Modern choanoflagellates are tiny, stalked organisms inhabiting shallow ponds, lakes, and marine environments (FIGURE 32.2). FIGURE 32.3 diagrams one hypothesis for how such an ancestor may have evolved into simple animals with specialized cells arranged in two or more layers.

 The remodeling of phylogenetic trees illustrates the process of scientific inquiry

On one hand, many biology students must find it frustrating that the phylogenetic trees pressed onto textbook pages cannot be memorized as fossilized truths. On the other hand, the current revolution in systematics is a healthy reminder that science is a process of inquiry that makes even the so-called "classical" fields, such as systematics and taxonomy, dynamic. As emerging technologies such as molecular biology and fresh approaches such as cladistics produce new data or stimulate scientists to reconsider old data, hypotheses sometimes bend or even break under the pressure of the closer scrutiny. New hypotheses or refinements of the old ones represent the latest versions of what we understand about nature based on the best available evidence. And evidence is the key word in this disclaimer that even our most cherished ideas in science are probationary. Science is partly distinguished from other ways of knowing because its ideas can be falsified through testing with experiments or observation. The more testing a hypothesis withstands, the more credible it becomes.

In comparing the traditional phylogenetic tree of animals based on anatomy and embryology with the remodeled tree based on molecular biology, we'll see agreement on some issues and disagreement on others. And though the new data from molecular systematics are compelling, the traditional view of animal phylogeny still offers some important advantages for helping us understand the diversity of animal body plans. That is the rationale for looking at both the "old" tree and the "new" tree in some detail as an overview of animal diversity.





 The traditional phylogenetic tree of animals is based mainly on grades in body "plans"

FIGURE 32.4 (p. 636) illustrates a phylogenetic tree in which relationships among the animal phyla are based mainly on key characteristics of body plan and embryonic development. Each major branch represents what systematists call a grade, which is defined by certain body-plan features shared by the animals belonging to that branch. The circled numbers on the tree mark four deep branch points distinguishing the major grades. For example, the first branch point splits the grade of animals with no true tissues (the parazoa) from the grade of animals with true tissues (the eumetazoa). Let's take a closer look at how the diverse body plans of animals can be organized into grades by focusing on each of these four main dichotomies (branchings).

		The Parazoa-Eumetazoa Dichotomy

Among the extant phyla, sponges (phylum Porifera) represent an early branch of the animal kingdom. Sponges have unique development and a structural simplicity that separates them from all other animal phyla. They lack true tissues and are called the parazoans (meaning "beside the animals"). Tissues are a basic feature of nearly all other animal phyla, collectively called the eumetazoans.


			  
		The Radiata-Bilateria Dichotomy

The eumetazoans are divided into two major branches, partly on the basis of body symmetry. Members of phylum Cnidaria (hydras; jellies, also called "jellyfishes"; sea anemones; and their relatives) and phylum Ctenophora (comb jellies) have radial symmetry (FIGURE 32.5a) and are collectively called radiata. A radial animal has a top and bottom, or an oral (mouth) and an aboral side, but no head end and rear end and no left and right. The other major branch of eumetazoan evolution led to animals with bilateral (two-sided) symmetry (FIGURE 32.5b). A bilateral animal has not only a dorsal (top) side and a ventral (bottom) side, but also an anterior (head) end and a posterior (tail) end and a left and right side. Animals of this body-plan grade are collectively called bilateria.

Fig 32-5. Body symmetry. The pail and shovel are included to help you remember the radial-bilateral distinction. (a) The parts of a radial animal, such as this sea anemone (phylum Cnidaria), radiate from the center. Any imaginary slice through the central axis would divide the animal into mirror images. (b) A bilateral animal, such as a lobster (phylum Arthropoda), has a left and right side. Only one imaginary cut would divide the animal into mirror-image halves.

Associated with bilateral symmetry is cephalization, an evolutionary trend toward the concentration of sensory equipment on the anterior end, the end of a traveling animal that is usually first to encounter food, danger, and other stimuli. In most bilateral animals, cephalization also includes the development of a central nervous system concentrated in the head and extending toward the tail as a longitudinal nerve cord. A head end is an adaptation for movement, such as crawling, burrowing, or swimming. The symmetry of an animal generally fits its lifestyle. Many radial animals are sessile forms (attached to a substratum) or plankton (drifting or weakly swimming aquatic forms). Their symmetry equips them to meet the environment equally well from all sides. Most animals that move actively from place to place are bilateral. These two fundamentally different kinds of symmetry probably arose very early in the history of animal life.

Another difference in body plan helps define the radiata-bilateria split: In all animals except sponges, the embryo becomes layered through the process of gastrulation (see FIGURE 32.1). As development progresses, these concentric layers, called germ layers, form the various tissues and organs of the body. Ectoderm, covering the surface of the embryo, gives rise to the outer covering of the animal and, in some phyla, to the central nervous system. Endoderm, the innermost germ layer, lines the developing digestive tube, or archenteron, and gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and organs derived from it, such as the liver and lungs of vertebrates. All eumetazoans except cnidarians and ctenophores (the radiata) have a third germ layer, the mesoderm, between the ectoderm and endoderm. Mesoderm forms the muscles and most other organs between the digestive tube and the outer covering of the animal. Cnidarians and ctenophores have only two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm) or have a third layer that is not homologous with the mesoderm of bilateral animals. As a group, the radiata are said to be diploblastic (having two germ layers). All other eumetazoans, the bilateria, are triploblastic (having three germ layers).


			  
		The Acoelomate, Pseudocoelomate, and Coelomate Grades

Triploblastic animals with solid bodies--that is, without a cavity between the digestive tract and outer body wall--are collectively called acoelomates (from the Greek a, without, and koilos, a hollow). This group includes phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms (FIGURE 32.6a, p. 638). In contrast to the acoelomates, most phyla of bilateral, triploblastic animals have tube-within-a-tube body plans, with a body cavity, a fluid-filled space separating the digestive tract from the outer body wall.

Fig 32-6. Body plans of the bilateria. The various organ systems of the animal develop from the three germ layers that form in the embryo. Colors traditionally used to represent the germ layers and their derivatives are blue for ectoderm, red for mesoderm, and yellow for endoderm.

Among animals with a body cavity, there are differences in how the cavity develops. If the cavity is not completely lined by tissue derived from mesoderm, it is termed a pseudocoelom. Animals with this body plan, such as rotifers (phylum Rotifera) and roundworms (phylum Nematoda), are called pseudocoelomates (FIGURE 32.6b). Coelomates are animals with a true coelom, a fluid-filled body cavity completely lined by tissue derived from mesoderm. The inner and outer layers of tissue that surround the cavity connect dorsally and ventrally to form mesenteries, which suspend the internal organs (see FIGURE 32.6c).

A body cavity has many functions. Its fluid cushions the suspended organs, helping to prevent internal injury. In soft-bodied coelomates such as earthworms, the noncompressible fluid of the body cavity is under pressure and functions as a hydrostatic skeleton against which muscles can work. The cavity also enables the internal organs to grow and move independently of the outer body wall. If it were not for your coelom, every beat of your heart or ripple of your intestine could deform your body surface, and exercise would distort the shapes of the internal organs.


			  
		The Protostome-Deuterostome Dichotomy Among Coelomates

The coelomate phyla are divided into two distinct grades: Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Mollusks, annelids, arthropods, and several other phyla represent one of these grades and are collectively called protostomes. Echinoderms, chordates, and some other phyla, collectively called deuterostomes, represent the other grade. (Some zoologists include the acoelomates and pseudocoelomates with the protostomes in the traditional phylogenetic tree, but this text uses the term protostome only as a subgroup of coelomate animals.) Protostomes and deuterostomes are distinguished by several fundamental differences in their development.

Cleavage.The pattern of cleavage divisions during early development generally differs between the two coelomate branches, though there are many exceptions to this distinction. Many protostomes undergo spiral cleavage, in which planes of cell division are diagonal to the vertical axis of the em bryo. As seen in the eight-cell stage resulting from spiral cleavage, small cells lie in the grooves between larger, underlying cells (FIGURE 32.7a). Furthermore, the so-called determinate cleavage of some protostomes rigidly casts the developmental fate of each embryonic cell very early. A cell isolated at the four-cell stage from a snail, for example, forms an inviable embryo that lacks parts.

Fig 32-7. A comparison of early development in protostomes and deuterostomes. These are useful general distinctions, though there are many variations and exceptions to these patterns of development.

In contrast to the spiral cleavage pattern, the zygotes of many deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage. Here, the cleavage planes are either parallel or perpendicular to the vertical axis of the egg; as seen in the eight-cell stage, the tiers of cells are aligned, one directly above the other. Most deuterostomes are further characterized by indeterminate cleavage, meaning that each cell produced by early cleavage divisions retains the capacity to develop into a complete embryo. For example, if the cells of a sea star embryo are separated at the four-cell stage, each will go on to form a normal larva. It is the indeterminate cleavage of the human zygote that makes identical twins possible. This characteristic also explains the developmental versatility of the embryonic "stem cells" that may provide new ways to overcome a variety of diseases, including juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (see Chapter 21).

Coelom Formation.Another difference between protostomes and deuterostomes is apparent later in development. In gastrulation, the developing digestive tube of an embryo initially forms as a blind pouch, the archenteron. As the archenteron forms in a protostome, initially solid masses of mesoderm split to form the coelomic cavities; this is called schizocoelous development (from the Greek schizo, split). Development of the body cavities of deuterostomes is termed enterocoelous: The mesoderm buds from the wall of the archenteron and hollows to become the coelomic cavities (FIGURE 32.7b).

Blastopore Fate.A third fundamental difference between protostomes and deuterostomes is in the fate of the blastopore, the opening of the archenteron. After the archenteron develops, a second opening forms at the opposite end of the gastrula. Ultimately, the blastopore and this second opening become the two ends of the digestive tube (the mouth and the anus). The mouth of many protostomes develops from the first opening, the blastopore, and it is for this characteristic that the protostome grade is named (from the Greek protos, first, and stoma, mouth). In contrast, the mouth of a deuterostome (from the Greek deuteros, second) is derived from the secondary opening, and the blastopore usually forms the anus, not the mouth (FIGURE 32.7c).

Let us now compare and contrast the traditional phylogenetic tree of animals based on grades in body plan (see FIGURE 32.4) with an emerging view of animal phylogeny based mainly on molecular systematics.





 Molecular systematists are moving some branches around on the phylogenetic tree of animals

Modern phylogenetic systematics is based on the identification of clades, which are monophyletic sets of taxa as defined by shared-derived characters unique to those taxa and their common ancestor (see Chapter 25). Based on cladistic methods, a phylogenetic tree takes shape as a hierarchy of clades nested within larger clades--the finer branches and major branches of the tree, respectively. The traditional phylogenetic tree of animals in FIGURE 32.4 is based on the assumption that grades in body plan are good indicators of clades, as long as the key anatomical and embryological homologies that define a grade are unique to the phyla placed on that evolutionary branch.

Molecular systematics has added a new set of shared-derived characters in the form of unique monomer sequences within certain genes and their products. And these molecular data can be used to identify the clusters of monophyletic taxa that make up clades. There wouldn't be much of a story here if molecular systematics simply reinforced the traditional animal tree based on comparative anatomy and embryology. But that is not the case.

The phylogenetic tree in FIGURE 32.8 is based on nucleotide sequences in the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA), the gene product that is so commonly analyzed by molecular systematists (see, for example, Chapters 27 and 28). Researchers have also sequenced some of the Hox genes in various animals, and so far those sequences support the phylogenetic tree based on SSU-rRNA analysis. Let's examine how this tree agrees with the traditional one, and how the two trees differ.

Fig 32-8. Animal phylogeny based on sequencing of SSU-rRNA. Note the two distinct clades of protostomes: Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. And note that these two clades include the acoelomates (Platyhelminthes), the pseudocoelomates (Nematoda and Rotifera), and the lophophorates (Bryozoa, Phoronida, and Brachiopoda).

How Are the Two Views of Animal Phylogeny Alike?

Agreement on the Deepest Branches.First, there is no dispute about the very deepest branches of animal phylogeny. Molecular systematics supports the traditional hypotheses of the Parazoa-Eumetazoa and Radiata-Bilateria dichotomies (see branch points 
			  
		 and 
			  
		 in FIGURE 32.4).

Agreement on the Deuterostome Clade.Second, the molecular evidence reinforces the hypothesis that the deuterostomes, which include echinoderms such as sea stars and chordates such as vertebrates, make up a clade--a monophyletic sub-branch of the coelomate bilateria (see branch point 
			  
		 in FIGURE 32.4).

How Are the Two Views of Animal Phylogeny Different?

You can see where the traditional and molecular-based phylogenetic trees clash by focusing on the protostome branch of the bilateria as represented in FIGURE 32.8.

Two Main Protostome Clades.First, note that the molecular evidence resolves two distinct clades within the protostomes: Lophotrochozoa, which includes the annelids (segmented worms) and the mollusks (such as clams and snails); and Ecdysozoa, which includes the arthropods. (We'll derive these very intimidating terms shortly.)

Based on comparative anatomy and embryology alone, the relationships among the annelids, mollusks, and arthropods were uncertain. Some zoologists favored an annelid-arthropod lineage, partly because both annelids and arthropods have segmented bodies (think of an earthworm, which is an annelid, and the underside of the tail of a lobster, which is an arthropod). But other zoologists argued that certain features linked the annelids closer to the mollusks than to the arthropods. This hypothesis was based in part on the observation that many annelids and mollusks go through a similar larval stage called the trochophore larva (FIGURE 32.9). The molecular data add weight to the hypothesis of an annelid-mollusk clade.

Relocation of the Acoelomates and Pseudocoelomates. In the grade-based phylogeny of FIGURE 32.4, the acoelomate phylum Platyhelminthes (flatworms) branches from the tree before the origin of body cavities. But the molecular data place the flatworms among the protostomes, specifically within the lophotrochozoan clade. If this turns out to be correct, the implication is that flatworms are not the primitive "pre-coelomate" animals of the traditional phylogeny, but are protostomes in which the body plan became simplified by loss of the coelom later in evolution. Similarly, the molecular-based phylogeny also places the pseudocoelomate phyla Rotifera (rotifers) and Nematoda (nematodes, or round worms) within the protostome clade. Rotifers cluster with the lophotrochozoan phyla, while nematodes fit among the ecdysozoans.

The name Ecdysozoa refers to a characteristic shared by nematodes, arthropods, and some of the other ecdysozoan phyla (which are not included in our survey). These animals secrete external skeletons (exoskeletons)--the armor of a lobster is an example. As the animal grows, it molts, squirming out of its old exoskeleton and secreting a new, larger one. The shedding of the old exoskeleton is called ecdysis, the process for which the ecdysozoans are named (FIGURE 32.10). Though named for this characteristic, the clade is actually defined mainly by the molecular evidence for common ancestry.

Assignment of the Lophophorate Phyla.Take one more look at the traditional tree in FIGURE 32.4. Among the coelomates are three phyla called the lophophorate phyla. The animals of these three phyla all have a structure called a lophophore, a horseshoe-shaped crown of ciliated tentacles used for feeding (FIGURE 32.11). The lophophorate phyla share certain characteristics with protostomes and other features with deuterostomes--hence the dashed line indicating uncertain phylogeny in the traditional tree. If the molecular data stand up, they settle debate about the affinities of the lophophorate phyla by placing them as protostomes among the lophotrochozoans. Thus, we can now dissect this long word as the name for a group that unites the lophophore-bearing phyla with phyla having a trochophore larva. Note, however, that while the name of this clade may be based on anatomical and developmental characteristics, the animals are grouped mainly because they share certain DNA sequences.

Summary of the Two Views of Animal Diversity

We can summarize the differences between the traditional and molecular-based animal phylogenies this way: the molecular data recognize two distinct clades within the protostomes--Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa--and distribute the acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and lophophorate phyla among those two protostome clades. FIGURE 32.12 will help you review the two views of animal phylogeny.

Though we will base our survey of animal phyla in the next two chapters on the newer, molecular-based phylogeny, we do so with two caveats. First, we will not discard the concept of body-plan grades because it is still a very useful way to think about the diversity of animal forms that have evolved. Second, the phylogenetic tree of animals built from molecular data, like all such trees, represents a set of hypotheses about the history of life, and is thus tentative. The molecular phylogeny is based on just a very few genes--and mainly on one, the gene for SSU-rRNA. Many zoologists will probably stick with the grade-based phylogeny unless much more molecular evidence builds a convincing case for a new tree. In the meantime, the hypothetical tree based on molecules will inform continuing research, including additional studies of anatomy, embryology, cell structure, and other non-molecular analyses. Ideally, such research will eventually square the molecular data with the data from other approaches. Continued exploration of the fossil record, of course, will also help to reconstruct the history of the animal kingdom. But as we'll see in this chapter's last major section, there is a reason that it has not been possible so far for paleontologists to sort out the evolutionary relationships among the animal phyla.





 Most animal phyla originated in a relatively brief span of geologic time

The fossil record and molecular studies concur that the diversification that produced the many animal phyla occurred rapidly on the vast scale of geologic time. This relatively brief evolutionary episode probably lasted about 40 million years (about 565 to 525 million years ago) during the late Precambrian and early Cambrian (which began about 543 million years ago).

Paleontologists have named the last period of the Precambrian era the Ediacaran period, for the Ediacara Hills of Australia, where fossils of Precambrian animals were first discovered. The fossils range in age from about 565 to 543 million years old. Similar animals of the same vintage have since been found on other continents. There is some evidence that animal life began earlier, and maybe much earlier. In 2000, researchers reported the discovery of fossilized animal embryos in Chinese strata that are 570 million years old (see FIGURE 26.7). And in 1998, a team of paleontologists discovered what could be fossilized burrows of animals in rocks that are 1.1 billion years old. By themselves, these putative trace fossils of animals would not convince many biologists to push back the origin of animals so far. However, the data of molecular systematics also suggest an animal origin about a billion years ago. That would mean that the genesis of animals was part of an early diversification of multicellular eukaryotes, known mainly from fossils of algae (see FIGURE 26.6). Until there is more solid evidence for such ancient animals, however, all we know for sure is that a diversity of animals had evolved by the time of the Ediacaran period. Most of the Ediacaran fossils appear to represent cnidarians (animals similar to hydras), but soft-bodied mollusks (similar to a modern group called the chitons) were also present, and numerous fossilized burrows and tracks indicate the activities of several forms of worms.

In contrast to the relatively limited variety of Ediacaran animals, nearly all the major animal body plans appear in Cambrian rocks dating from 543 to 525 million years ago. During this relatively short span, a burst of animal origins called the Cambrian explosion left a rich fossil assemblage that includes the first animals with hard, mineralized skeletons (see FIGURE 26.8). The Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, is the most famous fossil bed documenting the diversity of Cambrian animals. Two other fossil sites, one in Greenland and the other in the Yunnan region of China, predate the Burgess Shale by more than 10 million years. Burgess Shale fossils are rather bizarre-looking in the context of the marine animals we know today (FIGURE 32.13). Some of these Cambrian forms may represent extinct "experiments" in animal diversity. However, most of the Cambrian fossils, as strange as they may appear to us, are simply ancient variations within the taxonomic boundaries of phyla still represented in the modern fauna. Indeed, the number of exclusively Cambrian phyla seems to be dropping as the fossils are studied more closely and are classified in extant phyla.

On the scale of geologic time, animals diversified so rapidly that it is difficult from the fossil record to sort out the sequence of branching in animal phylogeny. And that is why, when reconstructing the evolutionary history of animal phyla, systematists depend largely on clues from the comparative anatomy, embryology, developmental genetics, and molecular systematics of extant species.





 "Evo-devo" may clarify our understanding of the Cambrian diversification

What sparked the Cambrian explosion? There are three main hypotheses for what caused the diversification of animals:

Ecological Causes: The main variation on this hypothesis emphasizes the emergence during the Cambrian of predator-prey relationships. Such a change in the dynamics of biological communities would lead to a diversity of evolutionary adaptations such as various kinds of protective shells and diverse modes of locomotion.

Geologic Causes: Perhaps, for example, atmospheric oxygen finally reached a high enough concentration during the Cambrian to support the more active metabolism required for the feeding and other activities of mobile animals.

Genetic Causes: Much of the diversity in body form we observe among the 35 or so animal phyla is associated with variations in the spatial and temporal expression of Hox genes within developing embryos (see FIGURE 21.15). Thus, it is a reasonable hypothesis that the diversification of animals was associated with the evolution of the Hox complex of regulatory genes, which led to variation in morphology during embryonic development. In fact, the Cambrian explosion is a major interest of many of the biologists working in the field of "evo-devo," the new synthesis of evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

These three major hypothetical causes of the Cambrian explosion are not mutually exclusive. The relatively rapid radiation of animal phyla over a half-billion years ago may have been a product of multiple causes, both external (geologic change and ecological change) and internal (genetic change).

Some of the systematists studying animal phylogeny interpret the molecular data to mean that the Cambrian radiation was actually three explosions, not just one. Within each of the three main branches of bilateral animals--Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa, and Deuterostomia--the relationships among the phyla are difficult to resolve based on differences in SSU-rRNA. For example, one cannot tell from the molecular data whether, among the lophotrochozoans, flatworms are more closely related to mollusks or to annelids. This tight clustering of the nucleic acid sequences is consistent with a rapid diversification of phyla within each of the three major clades of bilateria. However, the molecular differences between those three great clades are relatively extensive and suggest that they branched apart very early, probably in the Precambrian. This deep branching of the bilateria may have been associated with the evolution of the Hox complex, but then geologic and/or ecological changes during the early Cambrian may have driven the diversification of phyla within each major clade (FIGURE 32.14).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 32-14. One Cambrian explosion, or three? The Cambrian explosion may actually have been a secondary diversification of each of three major body plans that evolved during the Precambrian.

Apparently, by the end of the Cambrian radiation, the animal phyla were locked into developmental patterns that constrained evolution enough that no additional phyla evolved after that period. Of course, this does not imply that animal evolution came to a halt; variations in developmental patterns continue to allow subtle changes in body structures and functions, leading to speciation and the origin of taxa below the phylum level.

Continuing research will help test these hypotheses. But even as the Cambrian explosion becomes less mysterious, it will seem no less wonderful. In the last half-billion years, animal evolution has mainly generated new variations on old "designs." In Chapters 33 and 34 we take a closer look at the extant animal phyla and their evolutionary history.

DEUTEROSTOMIA

   Phylum Echinodermata: Echinoderms have a water vascular system and secondary radial anatomy

   Phylum Chordata: The chordates include two invertebrate subphyla and all vertebrates

More than a million extant species of animals are known, and at least as many more will probably be identified by future generations of biologists. Animals are grouped into about 35 phyla, the exact number depending on the views of different systematists. Our survey of animal diversity focuses on just 15 of these phyla.

Animals inhabit nearly all environments on Earth, but most phyla consist mainly of aquatic species. The seas, where the first animals probably arose, are still home to the greatest number of animal phyla. The freshwater fauna is extensive, but not nearly as rich in diversity as the marine fauna.

Terrestrial habitats pose special problems for animals, as they do for plants (see Chapter 29), and few animal phyla have made successful evolutionary treks onto land. Earthworms (phylum Annelida) and land snails (phylum Mollusca) are generally confined to moist soil and vegetation. Only the vertebrates and arthropods, including insects and spiders, are represented by a great diversity of animal species adapted to various terrestrial environments.

Living as we do on land, our sense of animal diversity is biased in favor of vertebrates, the animals with backbones, which are well represented in terrestrial environments. But vertebrates make up one subphylum within phylum Chordata, less than 5%  of all animal species. If we were to sample the animals inhabiting a tidepool (as in the photograph on this page), a coral reef, or the rocks on a stream bottom, we would find ourselves in the realm of invertebrates, the animals without backbones. The diversity of invertebrates is the main subject of this chapter.

Our survey of invertebrate phyla will follow the branching pattern of the phylogenetic tree inFIGURE 33.1. This tree is based mainly on molecular data, as discussed in Chapter 32 (seeFIGURE 32.8, p. 640). However, much of our discussion of the diverse phyla will center on key differences in body "plan," the grades inFIGURE 32.4on page 636.

Fig 33-1. Review of animal phylogeny. This tree is a streamlined version of FIGURE 32.8 (p. 640). We'll use an even simpler miniature of the tree throughout this chapter, with individual branches sequentially highlighted to help place each clade in the overall context of animal phylogeny. Your instructor may prefer to connect his or her survey of animal phyla to FIGURE 32.4 (p. 636), which is based on evolutionary grades in the body plans of animals.





PARAZOA

 

 Phylum Porifera: Sponges are sessile with porous bodies and choanocytes



Of all the animals we will discuss, sponges (on branch Parazoa of the phylogenetic tree) represent the lineage closest to the colonial choanoflagellates that gave rise to the animal kingdom (see FIGURE 32.4). The cell layers of sponges are loose federations of cells, which are not really tissues because the cells are relatively unspecialized.





RADIATA

 

 Phylum Cnidaria: Cnidarians have radial symmetry, a gastrovascular cavity, and cnidocytes



 

 Phylum Ctenophora: Comb jellies possess rows of ciliary plates and adhesive colloblasts



All animals except sponges belong to a clade called Eumetazoa, the animals with true tissues (see Chapter 32). Among the eumetazoans, the oldest clade is Radiata, consisting of animals with radial symmetry and diploblastic embryos (with ectoderm and endoderm, but no mesoderm). The two phyla of Radiata, Cnidaria and Ctenophora, may have had separate origins from different parazoan ancestors.





PROTOSTOMIA: LOPHOTROCHOZOA

 

 Phylum Platyhelminthes: Flatworms are acoelomates with gastrovascular cavities



 

 Phylum Rotifera: Rotifers are pseudocoelomates with jaws, crowns of cilia, and complete digestive tracts



 

 The lophophorate phyla: Bryozoans, phoronids, and brachiopods are coelomates with ciliated tentacles around their mouths



 

 Phylum Nemertea: Proboscis worms are named for their prey-capturing apparatus



 

 Phylum Mollusca: Mollusks have a muscular foot, a visceral mass, and a mantle



 

 Phylum Annelida: Annelids are segmented worms



The molecular-based phylogeny in FIGURE 33.1 includes the hypothesis that the bilateral animals make up a monophyletic group (clade Bilateria) derived from a common ancestor. And this hypothesis implies that the original bilateral animals--called urbilateria ("ur" is a prefix meaning earliest)--were relatively complex animals with true body cavities (coeloms). In this view of animal phylogeny, simpler bilaterians lacking coeloms (acoelomates) and those having pseudocoeloms (not completely lined by mesoderm) evolved secondarily from coelomates. The molecular data place the origin of bilaterians in the Precambrian period, before the Cambrian explosion. And trace fossils apparently left in Precambrian sediments by burrowing animals support the hypothesis of an early origin for the coelom, which provides a hydraulic skeleton that can function in burrowing (see Chapter 32).

The data from molecular systematics reinforce the traditional division of the bilateral animals, based mainly on differences in embryonic development, into the protostomes and deuterostomes (compare FIGURES 32.4 and 32.8; also, see FIGURE 32.7). However, the molecular-based phylogeny splits the protostomes into two clades: Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa (these names are derived in Chapter 32). In this section, we take a closer look at the lophotrochozoan phyla.





PROTOSTOMIA: ECDYSOZOA

 

 Phylum Nematoda: Roundworms are nonsegmented pseudocoelomates covered by tough cuticles



 

 Arthropods are segmented coelomates with exoskeletons and jointed appendages



Though the ecdysozoans are considered a clade based mainly on the data of molecular systematics, this branch of protostomes is named for a characteristic of life history: ecdysis, the shedding of an exoskeleton outgrown by the animal. Of the several ecdysozoan phyla, we will examine only the nematodes and the arthropods.





DEUTEROSTOMIA

 

 Phylum Echinodermata: Echinoderms have a water vascular system and secondary radial anatomy



 

 Phylum Chordata: The chordates include two invertebrate subphyla and all vertebrates



At first glance, sea stars and other echinoderms may seem to have little in common with the phylum Chordata, which includes the vertebrates: fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. These animals, however, share features characteristic of deuterostomes: radial cleavage, development of the coelom from the archenteron, and formation of the mouth at the end of the embryo opposite the blastopore (see FIGURE 32.7). Molecular systematics has reinforced Deuterostomia as a clade of bilaterian animals.





 Phylum Porifera: Sponges are sessile with porous bodies and choanocytes

Sponges are sessile animals that appear so sedate to the human eye that the ancient Greeks believed them to be plants. Sponges have no nerves or muscles, but the individual cells can sense and react to changes in the environment.

Sponges range in height from about 1 cm to 2 m. Of the 9,000 or so species of sponges, only about 100 live in fresh water; the rest are marine. The body of a simple sponge resembles a sac perforated with holes (Porifera means pore bearer; FIGURE 33.2). Water is drawn through the pores into a central cavity, the spongocoel, then flows out of the sponge through a larger opening called the osculum. More complex sponges have folded body walls, and many contain branched water canals and several oscula. Under certain conditions, the cells around the pores and osculum contract, closing the openings.

Fig 33-2. A sponge. Sessile animals without specialized organs and tissues, sponges filter food from water pumped through their porous bodies. The diverse species of sponges vary in shape, color, and structural complexity. Some species are brightly pigmented by symbiotic algae. This is an azure vase sponge, Callyspongia plicifera.

Nearly all sponges are suspension-feeders (also known as filter-feeders), which are animals that collect food particles from water passed through some type of food-trapping equipment. Sponges trap food from the water circulated through the porous body. To obtain enough food to grow by 100 g (about 3 ounces), a sponge must filter 1,000 kg (about 275 gallons) of seawater. Lining the inside of the spongocoel or internal water chambers are flagellated choanocytes, or collar cells (for the membranous collar around the base of the flagellum). The flagella generate a water current, and the collars trap food particles that the choanocytes then ingest by phagocytosis (FIGURE 33.3). The similarity between choanocytes and the cells of choanoflagellates reinforces the molecular evidence in supporting the hypothesis of an animal origin from a choanoflagellate ancestor.

Fig 33-3. Anatomy of a sponge. The wall of this simple sponge has two layers of cells separated by a gelatinous matrix, the mesohyl ("middle matter"). The outer layer consists of tightly packed epidermal cells. The incurrent pores are channels through porocytes, cells shaped like elongated doughnuts that span the body wall. The spongocoel is lined mainly by choanocytes, each with a flagellum ringed by a collar of fingerlike projections coated with mucus. Beating flagella sweep large volumes of water (arrows) into the body through the incurrent pores. Food particles are trapped in mucus on the collar, phagocytosed, and digested within choanocytes and adjacent amoebocytes. Mobile amoebocytes transport nutrients to other cells of the body and also produce materials for skeletal fibers (spicules).

The body of a sponge consists of two layers of cells separated by a gelatinous region called the mesohyl. Wandering through the mesohyl are cells called amoebocytes, named for their use of pseudopodia. Amoebocytes have many functions. They take up food from the water and from choanocytes, digest it, and carry nutrients to other cells. Amoebocytes also form tough skeletal fibers within the mesohyl. In some groups of sponges, these fibers are sharp spicules made from calcium carbonate or silica; other sponges produce more flexible fibers composed of a collagen protein called spongin. We use these pliant, honeycombed skeletons as bath sponges.

Most sponges are hermaphrodites (from the Greek Hermes, the god, and Aphrodite, the goddess), meaning that each individual functions as both male and female in sexual reproduction by producing sperm and eggs. Gametes arise from choanocytes or amoebocytes. Eggs reside in the mesohyl, but sperm cells are carried out of the sponge by the water current. Cross-fertilization results from some of the sperm being drawn into neighboring individuals. Fertilization occurs in the mesohyl, where the zygotes develop into flagellated, swimming larvae that disperse from the parent. Upon settling on a suitable substratum, a larva develops into the sessile adult.

Sponges are capable of extensive regeneration, the replacement of lost parts. They use regeneration not only for repair but also to reproduce asexually from fragments broken off a parent sponge.





 Phylum Cnidaria: Cnidarians have radial symmetry, a gastrovascular cavity, and cnidocytes

Lacking mesoderm, the cnidarians (hydras, jellies, sea anemones, and coral animals) have a relatively simple body construction. Nonetheless, they are a diverse group with over 10,000 living species, most of which are marine.

The basic body plan of a cnidarian is a sac with a central digestive compartment, the gastrovascular cavity. A single opening to this cavity functions as both mouth and anus. This basic body plan has two variations: the sessile polyp and the floating medusa (FIGURE 33.4). Polyps are cylindrical forms that adhere to the substratum by the aboral end of the body and extend their tentacles, waiting for prey. Examples of the polyp form are hydras and sea anemones. A medusa is a flattened, mouthdown version of the polyp. It moves freely in the water by a combination of passive drifting and contractions of its bell-shaped body. The animals we generally call jellies are medusas. The tentacles of a jelly dangle from the oral surface, which points downward. Some cnidarians exist only as polyps, others only as medusas, and still others pass sequentially through both a medusa stage and a polyp stage in their life cycle.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-4. Polyp and medusa forms of cnidarians. The body wall of (a) a polyp or (b) a medusa has two layers of cells, an outer layer of epidermis (from ectoderm) specialized for protection and an inner layer of gastrodermis (from endoderm) for digestion. Digestion begins in the gastrovascular cavity and is completed within the gastrodermal cells in food vacuoles. Flagella on the gastrodermal cells keep the contents of the gastrovascular cavity agitated and help distribute nutrients. Sandwiched between the epidermis and gastrodermis is a gelatinous layer of mesoglea. In many medusas, the mesoglea is thick and jellylike--thus the name jellies.

Cnidarians are carnivores that use tentacles arranged in a ring around the mouth to capture prey and push the food into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion begins. The undigested remains are egested through the mouth/anus. The tentacles are armed with batteries of cnidocytes, unique cells that function in defense and the capture of prey (FIGURE 33.5). Cnidocytes contain cnidae, capsule-like organelles capable of everting, giving phylum Cnidaria its name (from the Greek cnide, nettle). Cnidae called nematocysts are stinging capsules.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-5. A cnidocyte of a hydra. This type of cnidocyte contains a stinging capsule, the nematocyst, which itself contains an inverted thread. When a "trigger" is stimulated by touch or by certain chemicals, the thread shoots out from the nematocyst, puncturing and injecting poison into prey. Other kinds of cnidocytes have longer threads that stick to prey or entangle small animals that bump into the tentacles.

Muscles and nerves occur in their simplest forms in cnidarians. Cells of the epidermis (outer layer) and gastrodermis (inner layer) have bundles of microfilaments arranged into contractile fibers (see Chapter 7). True muscle tissue develops from mesoderm and does not appear in diploblastic animals. The gastrovascular cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton against which the contractile cells can work. When the animal closes its mouth, the volume of the cavity is fixed, and contraction of selected cells causes the animal to change shape. Movements are coordinated by a nerve net. Cnidarians have no brain, and the noncentralized nerve net is associated with simple sensory receptors that are distributed radially around the body. Thus, the animal can detect and respond to stimuli equally from all directions.

The phylum Cnidaria is divided into three major classes: Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, and Anthozoa (TABLE 33.1; FIGURE 33.6, p. 650).

Fig 33-6. Representatives of the cnidarian classes. (a) Polyps of a colonial species belonging to class Hydrozoa. (b) Jellies of class Scyphozoa. The medusa is the conspicuous stage of the scyphozoan life cycle. Many species of jellies, including this one, glow in the dark (bioluminescence). The largest scyphozoan species have tentacles over 100 m long dangling from umbrellas up to 2 m in diameter. (c) Sea anemones and other members of class Anthozoa exist only as polyps. (d) A colony of coral polyps (class Anthozoa). Many coral animals harbor symbiotic algae that contribute to the food supply of the polyps. Coral reefs, which provide habitats for an enormous variety of invertebrates and fishes, are restricted to warm, shallow seas. This is a star coral.

Table 33-1. Classes of Phylum Cnidaria

Class and ExamplesMain CharacteristicsHydrozoa (Portuguese man-of-war, hydras, Obelia, some corals) (see FIGURES 33.6a and 33.7)Most marine, a few freshwater; both polyp and medusa stages in; most species; polyp stage often colonialScyphozoa (jellies, sea wasp, sea nettle) (see FIGURE 33.6b)All marine; polyp stage reduced; free-swimming; medusas up to 2 m in diameterAnthozoa (sea anemones, most corals, sea fans) (see FIGURE 33.6c and d)All marine; medusa stage completely absent; sessile, many colonialClass Hydrozoa

Most hydrozoans alternate polyp and medusa forms, as in the life cycle of Obelia (FIGURE 33.7). The polyp stage, a colony of interconnected polyps in the case of Obelia, is more conspicuous than the medusas. Hydras, among the few cnidarians found in fresh water, are unusual members of class Hydrozoa in that they exist only in the polyp form. When environmental conditions are favorable, a hydra reproduces asexually by budding, the formation of outgrowths that pinch off from the parent to live independently (see FIGURE 13.1). When environmental conditions deteriorate, hydras reproduce sexually, forming resistant zygotes that remain dormant until conditions improve.

Fig 33-7. The life cycle of the hydrozoan Obelia. The polyp stage is asexual, the medusa stage is sexual, and these two stages alternate, one producing the other. But do not confuse this with the alternation of generations that occurs in the plant kingdom. Both polyp and medusa are diploid organisms. (Typical of animals, only the gametes of Obelia are haploid.) By contrast, one plant generation is haploid, and the other is diploid.

Class Scyphozoa

The medusa generally prevails in the life cycle of class Scyphozoa. The medusas of most species live among the plankton as jellies. Most coastal scyphozoans go through a small polyp stage during their life cycle, but jellies that live in the open ocean generally lack the sessile polyp.

Class Anthozoa

Sea anemones and corals belong to class Anthozoa ("flower animals"). They occur only as polyps. Coral animals live as solitary or colonial forms and secrete hard external skeletons of calcium carbonate. Each polyp generation builds on the skeletal remains of earlier generations to construct "rocks" with shapes characteristic of the species. It is these skeletons that we call coral.

In tropical seas, coral reefs provide habitat for a great diversity of invertebrates and fishes. Coral reefs in many parts of the world are currently being damaged by environmental changes--global warming is one suspect. We'll examine this problem in Chapter 54.





 Phylum Ctenophora: Comb jellies possess rows of ciliary plates and adhesive colloblasts

Comb jellies, or ctenophores, superficially resemble cnidarian medusas. However, the relationship between ctenophores and cnidarians is uncertain. There are only about 100 species of comb jellies, all of which are marine. Ctenophores range in diameter from about 1 to 10 cm. Most are spherical or ovoid, but there are elongate and ribbonlike forms up to 1 m long. Ctenophora means "comb-bearer," and these animals are named for their eight rows of comblike plates composed of fused cilia. They are the largest animals to use cilia for locomotion. An aboral sensory organ functions in orientation, and nerves running from the sensory organ to the combs of cilia coordinate movement. Most comb jellies have a pair of long, retractable tentacles (FIGURE 33.8). The tentacles bear adhesive structures called colloblasts (also called lasso cells). When prey (mostly small plankton) contact a tentacle, colloblasts burst open. A sticky thread released by each colloblast captures the food, which is then wiped off the tentacle into the mouth.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-8. A ctenophore, or comb jelly. This planktonic marine animal is named for its eight combs of cilia, used for locomotion. The retractable tentacles capture food. Ctenophores and cnidarians are radiate, diploblastic animals, but these two phyla may have originated independently from different parazoan ancestors.





 Phylum Platyhelminthes: Flatworms are acoelomates with gastrovascular cavities

There are about 20,000 species of flatworms living in marine, freshwater, and damp terrestrial habitats. In addition to many free-living forms, flatworms include many parasitic species, such as the flukes and the tapeworms. Flatworms are so named because their bodies are thin between the dorsal and ventral surfaces (flattened dorsoventrally; platyhelminth means "flat worm"). They range in size from nearly microscopic free-living species to certain tapeworms over 20 m long. (Note that "worm" is not a formal taxonomic name, but a general term for animals with long, thin bodies.)

In contrast to the radiate animals (cnidarians and ctenophores), flatworms and all other bilateratians are triploblastic. The middle embryonic tissue layer, mesoderm, contributes to the development of more complex organs and organ systems and to true muscle tissue. Thus the flatworms are structurally more complex than cnidarians or ctenophores. However, in common with the radiate animals, flatworms have a gastrovascular cavity with only one opening. (Tapeworms lack a digestive tract altogether and absorb nutrients across their body surface.) Flatworms are also simpler than other bilateratians in lacking a body cavity; flatworms are acoelomates.

Flatworms are divided into four classes: Turbellaria (mostly free-living flatworms), Monogenea (monogeneans), Trematoda (trematodes, or flukes), and Cestoidea (tapeworms) (TABLE 33.2).

Table 33-2. Classes of Phylum Platyhelminthes

Class and ExamplesMain CharacteristicsTurbellaria (mostly free-living flatworms; e.g., Dugesia) (see FIGURE 33.9 and 33.10)Most marine, some freshwater, a few terrestrial, predators and scavengers; body surface ciliatedMonogenea (monogeneans)Marine and freshwater parasites; most infect external surfaces of fishes; life history simple; a ciliated larva starts an infection on a hostTrematoda (trematodes, also called flukes) (see FIGURE 33.11)Parasites, almost always of vertebrates; two suckers attach to host; most life histories include intermediate hostsCestoidea (tapeworms) (see FIGURE 33.12)Parasites of vertebrates; scolex attaches to host; proglottids produce eggs and break off after fertilization; no head or digestive system; life history with one or more intermediate hostsClass Turbellaria

Turbellarians are nearly all free-living (nonparasitic) and mostly marine (FIGURE 33.9). Members of the genus Dugesia, commonly known as planarians, abound in unpolluted ponds and streams. Planarians are carnivores that prey on smaller animals or feed on dead animals (FIGURE 33.10).

Fig 33-10. Anatomy of a planarian.

Planarians and other flatworms lack organs specialized for gas exchange and circulation. The flat shape of the body places all cells close to the surrounding water, and fine branching of the gastrovascular cavity distributes food throughout the animal. Nitrogenous waste in the form of ammonia diffuses directly from the cells into the surrounding water. Flatworms also have a relatively simple excretory apparatus that functions mainly to maintain osmotic balance between the animal and its surroundings. This system consists of ciliated cells called flame cells that waft fluid through branched ducts opening to the outside (see FIGURE 44.18). The evolution of osmoregulatory structures was a major factor in allowing some turbellarians to invade freshwater and even moist terrestrial environments.

Planarians move by using cilia on the ventral epidermis, gliding along a film of mucus they secrete. Some turbellarians also use their muscles to swim through water with an undulating motion.

A planarian has a head (cephalized) with a pair of eyespots that detect light and lateral flaps that function mainly for smell. The planarian nervous system is more complex and centralized than the nerve nets of cnidarians. Planarians can learn to modify their responses to stimuli.

Planarians can reproduce asexually through regeneration. The parent constricts in the middle, and each half regenerates the missing end. Sexual reproduction also occurs. Although planarians are hermaphrodites, copulating mates cross-fertilize.

Classes Monogenea and Trematoda

The monogeneans and the trematodes (sometimes called flukes) live as parasites in or on other animals. Many have suckers for attaching to internal organs or to the outer surfaces of the host. A tough covering helps protect the parasites. Reproductive organs nearly fill the interior of these worms.

As a group, trematodes parasitize a wide range of hosts, and most species have complex life cycles with an alternation of sexual and asexual stages. Many trematodes require an intermediate host in which larvae develop before infecting the final host (usually a vertebrate), where the adult worm lives. For example, trematodes that parasitize humans spend parts of their life histories in snails (FIGURE 33.11). The 200 million people around the world who are infected with blood flukes (Schistosoma) suffer body pains, anemia, and dysentery.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-11. The life history of a blood fluke (Schistosoma mansoni).

Most monogeneans are external parasites of fishes. Their life cycle is relatively simple, with a ciliated, free-swimming larva starting an infection on a host. Although monogeneans have been traditionally aligned with the trematodes, some structural and chemical evidence suggests they are more closely related to tapeworms.

Class Cestoidea

Tapeworms (class Cestoidea) are also parasitic. The adults live mostly in vertebrates, including humans. The tapeworm head, or scolex, is armed with suckers and often menacing hooks that lock the worm to the intestinal lining of the host (FIGURE 33.12). Posterior to the scolex is a long ribbon of units called proglottids, which are little more than sacs of sex organs. Lacking a digestive tract, the tapeworm absorbs food predigested by the host.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-12. Anatomy of a tapeworm.

Mature proglottids, loaded with thousands of eggs, are released from the posterior end of a mature tapeworm and leave the host's body with feces. In one type of life cycle, human feces contaminate the food or water of intermediate hosts, such as pigs or cattle, and the tapeworm eggs develop into larvae that encyst in muscles of these animals. Humans acquire the larvae by eating undercooked meat contaminated with cysts, and the worms develop into mature adults within the human. Large tapeworms, which may be 20 m or more in length, can cause intestinal blockage and can rob enough nutrients from the human host to cause nutritional deficiencies. An orally administered drug named niclosamide kills the adult worms.





 Phylum Rotifera: Rotifers are pseudocoelomates with jaws, crowns of cilia, and complete digestive tracts

Rotifers (about 1,800 species) are tiny animals that mainly inhabit fresh water, although some live in the sea or in damp soil. Ranging in size from only about 0.05 to 2.0 mm, smaller than many protists, rotifers are nevertheless truly multicellular and have specialized organ systems (FIGURE 33.13). In contrast to cnidarians and flatworms, which have gastrovascular cavities, rotifers have a complete digestive tract, which is a digestive tube with a separate mouth and anus. Internal organs lie within the pseudocoelom, a body cavity that is not completely lined by mesoderm (see FIGURE 32.6b). Fluid in the pseudocoelom serves as a hydrostatic skeleton and as a medium for the internal transport of nutrients and wastes in these tiny animals. Movement of a rotifer's body distributes the fluid within the pseudocoelom, and thus this body cavity and its fluid function as a circulatory system.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-13. A rotifer. These pseudocoelomates, smaller than many protists, are much more anatomically complex than flatworms (LM).

The word rotifer, derived from Latin, means "wheel-bearer," a reference to the crown of cilia that draws a vortex of water into the mouth. Posterior to the mouth, a region of the digestive tract called the pharynx bears jaws (trophi) that grind food, mostly microorganisms suspended in the water.

Rotifer reproduction is unusual. Some species consist only of females that produce more females from unfertilized eggs, a type of reproduction called parthenogenesis. Other species produce two types of eggs that develop by parthenogenesis, one type forming females and the other type developing into degenerate males that cannot even feed themselves. The males survive long enough to produce sperm that fertilize eggs, forming resistant zygotes that can survive when a pond dries up. When conditions are favorable again, the zygotes break dormancy and develop into a new female generation that then reproduces by parthenogenesis until conditions become unfavorable again.





 The lophophorate phyla: Bryozoans, phoronids, and brachiopods are coelomates with ciliated tentacles around their mouths

In subdividing bilaterians into protostomes and deuterostomes based on embryological criteria, the lophophorate phyla, including Bryozoa, Phoronida, and Brachiopoda, were never a good fit in either coelomate branch. However, molecular data place the lophophorates squarely in the protostome branch. These phyla are collectively called the lophophorate animals after the most distinctive structure they share, the lophophore (FIGURE 33.14). The lophophore is a horseshoe-shaped or circular fold of the body wall bearing ciliated tentacles that surround the mouth (see FIGURE 32.11). The anus lies outside the whorl of tentacles. The cilia draw water toward the mouth between the tentacles, which help trap food particles for these suspension-feeders. The common occurrence of this complex apparatus in the lophophorate animals suggests that the three phyla are related. Other similarities, such as a U-shaped digestive tract and the absence of a distinct head, are adaptations to a sessile existence. In contrast to flatworms, which lack body cavities, and rotifers, which have pseudocoeloms, lophophorates have true coeloms completely lined by mesoderm (see FIGURE 32.6c).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-14. The lophophorate animals. The most distinctive characteristic of these phyla is the lophophore, an organ that functions in suspension-feeding. (a) Bryozoans, such as this common sea mat (Membranipora membranacea), are colonial lophophorates, many with hard exoskeletons. (b) Brachiopods are lophophorates with a hinged shell. The two parts of the shell are dorsal and ventral, in contrast to the lateral shells of bivalve mollusks (such as clams).

Bryozoans are colonial animals that superficially resemble mosses. (Bryozoa means "moss animals.") In most species, the colony is encased in a hard exoskeleton with pores through which the lophophores of the animals extend (FIGURE 33.14a). Of the 5,000 species of bryozoans, most live in the sea, where they are among the most widespread and numerous sessile animals. Several species are important reef builders.

Phoronids are tube-dwelling marine worms ranging from 1 mm to 50 cm in length. Some live buried in the sand within tubes made of chitin, extending their lophophore from the opening of the tube and withdrawing it into the tube when threatened. There are only about 15 species of phoronid worms in two genera.

Brachiopods, or lamp shells, superficially resemble clams and other bivalve mollusks, but the two halves of the brachiopod shell are dorsal and ventral to the animal rather than lateral, as in clams (FIGURE 33.14b). A brachiopod lives attached to its substratum by a stalk, opening its shell slightly to allow water to flow between the shells and the lophophore. All brachiopods are marine. The living brachiopods are remnants of a much richer past; only about 330 extant species are known, but there are 30,000 species of Paleozoic and Mesozoic fossils. A tie to the past is Lingula, a living brachiopod genus that has changed little in 400 million years.





 Phylum Nemertea: Proboscis worms are named for their prey-capturing apparatus

Members of the phylum Nemertea are called proboscis worms or ribbon worms (FIGURE 33.15). A proboscis worm's body is structurally acoelomate, like that of a flatworm, but it contains a small fluid-filled sac that may be a reduced version of a true coelom. The sac and fluid hydraulically operate an extensible proboscis by which the worm captures prey.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-15. A proboscis worm, phylum Nemertea.

Proboscis worms range in length from less than 1 mm to more than 30 m. Nearly all of the 900 or so members of this phylum are marine, but a few species inhabit fresh water or damp soil. Some are active swimmers, and others burrow in the sand.

Proboscis worms and flatworms have similar excretory, sensory, and nervous systems. But, in addition to the unique proboscis apparatus, two anatomical features not found in flatworms have evolved in the phylum Nemertea: a complete digestive tract (with mouth and anus) and a closed circulatory system--the blood is contained in vessels and is therefore distinct from fluid in the body cavity. Proboscis worms have no heart, but the blood is propelled by muscles squeezing the vessels.





 Phylum Mollusca: Mollusks have a muscular foot, a visceral mass, and a mantle

Snails and slugs, oysters and clams, and octopuses and squids are all mollusks. In all, the phylum Mollusca has more than 150,000 known species. Most mollusks are marine, though some inhabit fresh water, and there are snails and slugs that live on land. Mollusks are soft-bodied animals (from the Latin molluscus, soft), but most are protected by a hard shell made of calcium carbonate. Slugs, squids, and octopuses have reduced shells, most of which are internal, or they have lost their shells completely during their evolution.

Despite their apparent differences, all mollusks have a similar body plan (FIGURE 33.16). The body has three main parts: a muscular foot, usually used for movement; a visceral mass containing most of the internal organs; and a mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes a shell (if one is present). In many mollusks, the mantle extends beyond the visceral mass, producing a water-filled chamber, the mantle cavity, which houses the gills, anus, and excretory pores. Many mollusks feed by using a straplike rasping organ called a radula to scrape up food.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-16. The basic body plan of mollusks. Three hallmarks of the phylum are the mantle, visceral mass, and foot. A mantle cavity houses gills in many species. The long digestive tract is coiled in the visceral mass. Most mollusks have an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart that pumps circulatory fluid (hemolymph) through arteries into sinuses (body spaces) bathing the organs. Excretory organs called nephridia remove metabolic wastes from the hemolymph. The nervous system consists of a nerve ring around the esophagus, from which nerve cords extend. The enlargement shows the mouth region with the radula, a rasplike feeding organ present in many mollusks. The radula is a belt of backward-curved teeth that extends from the mouth and slides back and forth, scraping and scooping like a backhoe.

Most mollusks have separate sexes, with gonads (ovaries or testes) located in the visceral mass. Many snails, however, are hermaphrodites. The life cycle of many marine mollusks includes a ciliated larva called the trochophore, also characteristic of marine annelids (segmented worms) and some other lophotrochozoans (see FIGURE 32.9).

The basic body plan of mollusks has evolved in various ways in the different classes of the phylum. Of the eight classes, we examine four here: Polyplacophora (chitons), Gastropoda (snails and slugs), Bivalvia (clams, oysters, and other bivalves), and Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, and nautiluses) (TABLE 33.3).

Table 33-3. Major Classes of Phylum Mollusca

Class and ExamplesMain CharacteristicsPolyplacophora (chitons)(see FIGURE 33.17)Marine; shell with eight plates; foot used for locomotion; head reducedGastropoda (snails, slugs) (see FIGURES 33.18 and 33.19)Marine, freshwater, or terrestrial; asymmetric body, usually with a coiled shell; shell reduced or absent in some; foot for locomotion; radula presentBivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters) (see FIGURES 33.20 and 33.21)Marine and freshwater, flattened shell with two valves; head reduced; paired gills; most are filter-feeders; mantle forms siphonsCephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses) (see FIGURE 33.22)Marine; head surrounded by grasping tentacles, usually with suckers; shell external, internal, or absent; mouth with or without radula; locomotion by jet propulsion using siphon made from mantleClass Polyplacophora

Chitons are marine animals with oval shapes and shells divided into eight dorsal plates (the body itself, however, is unsegmented). You can find chitons clinging to rocks along the shore during low tide (FIGURE 33.17). Try to dislodge a chiton by hand, and you will be surprised at how well its foot, acting as a suction cup, grips the rock. Using this muscular foot, a chiton can creep slowly over the rock surface. Chitons are grazers that use their radulas to cut and ingest algae.

Fig 33-17. A chiton. Clinging tenaciously to rocks in the intertidal zone, this chiton (class Polyplacophora) displays the eight-plate shell characteristic of this class of mollusks.

Class Gastropoda

The largest of the molluscan classes, Gastropoda has more than 40,000 living species. Most gastropods are marine, but there are also many freshwater species. Garden snails and slugs have adapted to land.

The most distinctive characteristic of the class Gastropoda is a process known as torsion. During embryonic development, an asymmetrical muscle forms, and contraction of the muscle and uneven growth causes the visceral mass to rotate up to 180 degrees, so that the anus and mantle cavity are placed above the head in the adult (FIGURE 33.18). Some zoologists speculate that the advantage of torsion is to place the visceral mass and heavy shell more centrally over the snail's body.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-18. The results of torsion in a gastropod. Because of torsion (twisting of the visceral mass) during embryonic development, the digestive tract is coiled and the anus is near the mouth at the head end of the animal. After torsion, some of the organs that were bilateral are reduced in size or are lost on one side of the body. Torsion should not be confused with the formation of a coiled shell, which is an independent developmental process.

Most gastropods are protected by single, spiraled shells into which the animals can retreat when threatened (FIGURE 33.19). The shell is often conical, but abalones and limpets have somewhat flattened shells. Many gastropods have distinct heads with eyes at the tips of tentacles. Gastropods inch along literally at a snail's pace by a rippling motion of the elongated foot. Most gastropods use their radula to graze on algae or plant material. Several groups, however, are predators, and the radula is modified for boring holes in the shells of other mollusks or for tearing apart tough animal tissue. In one group, the cone snails, the teeth of the radula form separate poison darts, which penetrate prey, including fishes.

Gastropods are among the few invertebrate groups to have successfully populated the land. Terrestrial snails lack the gills typical of most aquatic gastropods, and instead the lining of the mantle cavity functions as a lung, exchanging respiratory gases with the air.

Class Bivalvia

The mollusks of class Bivalvia include many species of clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops. Bivalves have shells divided into two halves (FIGURE 33.20). The two parts of the shell are hinged at the mid-dorsal line, and powerful adductor muscles draw the two halves tightly together to protect the soft-bodied animal. When the shell is open, the bivalve may extend its hatchet-shaped foot for digging or anchoring.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-20. A bivalve. This scallop has many eyes peering out between the two halves of the hinged shell.

The mantle cavity of a bivalve contains gills that are used for feeding as well as gas exchange (FIGURE 33.21). Most bivalves are suspension-feeders. They trap fine food particles in mucus that coats the gills, and cilia then convey the particles to the mouth. Water flows into the mantle cavity through an incurrent siphon, passes over the gills, and then exits the mantle cavity through an excurrent siphon. Bivalves have no distinct head, and the radula has been lost.

Fig 33-21. Anatomy of a clam. The left half of the bivalve shell has been removed. Food particles suspended in water that enters through the incurrent siphon are collected by the gills and passed via cilia and elongated flaps called palps to the mouth.

Being suspension-feeders, most bivalves lead rather sedentary lives. Sessile mussels secrete strong threads that tether them to rocks, docks, boats, and the shells of other animals. Clams can pull themselves into the sand or mud, using the muscular foot for an anchor. In addition to digging, scallops can also skitter along the seafloor by flapping their shells, rather like the mechanical false teeth sold in novelty shops.

Class Cephalopoda

Cephalopods are built for speed, an adaptation that fits their carnivorous diet. Squids and octopuses use beaklike jaws to bite their prey; they then inject poison to immobilize the victim. The mouth is at the center of several long tentacles. A mantle covers the visceral mass, but the shell is reduced and internal (squids) or missing altogether (many octopuses) (FIGURES 33.22a and b). One small group of shelled cephalopods, the chambered nautiluses, survives today (FIGURE 33.22c).

(b) Octopuses are believed to be among the most intelligent invertebrates. (c) Chambered nautiluses are the only extant cephalopods with external shells.

A squid darts about, usually backward, by drawing water into its mantle cavity and then firing a jet stream of water through the excurrent siphon that points anteriorly. The animal steers by pointing the siphon in different directions. The foot of a cephalopod has become modified into this muscular siphon and parts of the tentacles and head. (Cephalopod means "head foot.") Most species of squid are less than 75 cm long, but there are also giant squids, the largest of all invertebrates. The biggest specimen on record was 17 m long (including the tentacles) and weighed about 2 tons.

Rather than swimming as squids do in the open seas, most octopuses live on the seafloor, where they creep and scurry about in search of crabs and other food.

Cephalopods are the only mollusks with a closed circulatory system. They also have a well-developed nervous system with a complex brain. The ability to learn and behave in a complex manner is probably more critical to fast-moving predators than to sedentary animals such as clams. Squids and octopuses also have well-developed sense organs.

The ancestors of octopuses and squids were probably shelled mollusks that took up a predaceous lifestyle, the loss of the shell occurring in later evolution. Shelled cephalopods called ammonites, some of them as large as truck tires, were the dominant invertebrate predators of the seas for hundreds of millions of years until their disappearance during the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous period (see Chapter 25).





 Phylum Annelida: Annelids are segmented worms

ANNELIDA means "little rings," and a segmented body resembling a series of fused rings is a hallmark of the annelid worms. There are about 15,000 annelid species, ranging in length from less than 1 mm to the 3-m length of a giant Australian earthworm. Annelids live in the sea, most freshwater habitats, and damp soil. We can describe the anatomy of annelids in terms of a well-known member of the phylum, the earthworm (FIGURE 33.23).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-23. Anatomy of an earthworm. Annelids are segmented both externally and internally. Many of the internal structures are repeated, segment by segment. Externally, each segment has four pairs of setae, bristles that provide traction for burrowing. Earthworms and many other annelids creep along or burrow by coordinating two sets of muscles, one longitudinal and the other circular (see FIGURE 49.27). These muscles work against the noncompressible coelomic fluid, a hydrostatic skeleton.

The coelom of the earthworm is partitioned by septa, but the digestive tract, longi tudinal blood vessels, and nerve cords penetrate the septa and run the length of the animal (the major vessels have segmental branches). The digestive system has several specialized regions: the pharynx, the esophagus, the crop, the gizzard, and the intestine. The closed circulatory system consists of a network of vessels containing blood with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin. Dorsal and ventral vessels are connected by segmental pairs of vessels. The dorsal vessel and five pairs of vessels that circle the esophagus of an earthworm are muscular and pump blood through the circulatory system. Tiny blood vessels are abundant in the earthworm's skin, which functions as its respiratory organ.

In each segment of the worm is a pair of excretory tubes called metanephridia with ciliated funnels, called nephrostomes, that remove wastes from the blood and coelomic fluid. The metanephridia lead to exterior pores, through which the metabolic wastes are discharged.

A brainlike pair of cerebral ganglia lies above and in front of the pharynx. A ring of nerves around the pharynx connects to a subpharyngeal ganglion, from which a fused pair of nerve cords runs posteriorly. All along these ventral nerve cords are segmental ganglia, also fused.

Earthworms are hermaphrodites, but they cross-fertilize. Two earthworms mate by aligning themselves in such a way that they exchange sperm, and then they separate. The received sperm cells are stored temporarily while a special organ, the clitellum, secretes a mucous cocoon. The cocoon slides along the worm, picking up the eggs and then the stored sperm. The cocoon then slips off the worm's head and resides in the soil while the embryos develop. Some earthworms can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation followed by regeneration.

Some aquatic annelids swim in pursuit of food, but most are bottom-dwellers that burrow in the sand and silt; earthworms, of course, are burrowers.

The phylum Annelida is divided into three classes: Oligochaeta (earthworms and their relatives), Polychaeta (polychaetes), and Hirudinea (leeches) (TABLE 33.4).

Table 33-4. Classes of Phylum Annelida

Class and ExamplesMain CharacteristicsOligochaeta (terrestrial and freshwater segmented worms; e.g., earthworms) (see FIGURES 33.23 and 33.24a)Reduced head; no parapodia, but setae presentPolychaeta (mostly marine segmented worms) (see FIGURE 33.24b and c)Well-developed head; each segment usually has parapodia with setae; tube-dwelling and free-livingHirudinea (leeches) (see FIGURE 33.24d)Body usually flattened, with reduced coelom and segmentation; setae absent; suckers at anterior and posterior ends; parasites, predators, and scavengersClass Oligochaeta

This class of segmented worms includes the earthworms and a variety of aquatic species (FIGURE 33.24a). An earthworm eats its way through the soil, extracting nutrients as the soil passes through the digestive tube. Undigested material, mixed with mucus secreted into the digestive tract, is egested as castings through the anus. Farmers value earthworms because the animals till the earth, and the castings improve the texture of the soil. Darwin estimated that 1 acre of British farmland had about 50,000 earthworms that produced 18 tons of castings per year.

Fig 33-24. Annelids, the segmented worms. (a) Class Oligochaeta: Some giant Australian earthworms are bigger than snakes. (b) Class Polychaeta: Most polychaetes are marine worms. Each segment has a pair of lateral flaps that function in movement and as gills for the exchange of respiratory gases with the surrounding water. (c) Fanworms are tube-dwellers that use their feathery headdresses for gas exchange and to extract suspended food particles from the seawater. This species is known as a Christmas-tree worm. (d) Class Hirudinea: A nurse applied this medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) to a patient's sore thumb to drain blood from a hematoma (abnormal accumulation of blood around an internal injury).

Class Polychaeta

Each segment of a polychaete (meaning "many setae," for the bristles on each segment) has a pair of paddlelike or ridgelike structures called parapodia ("almost feet") that function in locomotion. Each parapodium has several setae made of the polysaccharide chitin. In many polychaetes the parapodia are richly supplied with blood vessels and function as gills (FIGURE 33.24b).

Most polychaetes are marine. A few drift and swim among the plankton, many crawl on or burrow in the seafloor, and many others live in tubes, which the worms make by mixing mucus with bits of sand and broken shells. The tube-dwellers include the brightly colored fanworms, which trap microscopic food particles in feathery tentacles that extend from the opening of the tube (FIGURE 33.24c).

Class Hirudinea

The majority of leeches inhabit fresh water, but there are also land leeches that move through moist vegetation. Many leeches feed on other invertebrates, but some are blood-sucking parasites that feed by attaching temporarily to other animals, including humans. Leeches range in length from about 1 to 30 cm. Some parasitic species use bladelike jaws to slit the skin of the host, whereas others secrete enzymes that digest a hole through the skin. The host is usually oblivious to this attack because the leech secretes an anesthetic. After making the incision, the leech secretes another chemical, hirudin, which keeps the blood of the host from coagulating. The parasite then sucks as much blood as it can hold, often more than ten times its own weight. After this gorging, a leech can last for months without another meal.

Until this century, leeches were frequently used by physicians for bloodletting. Leeches are still used for treating bruised tissues and for stimulating the circulation of blood to fingers or toes that have been sewn back to hands or feet after accidents (FIGURE 33.24d).

Before leaving annelids, let's highlight two evolutionary adaptations that are well developed in this phylum: the coelom and segmentation. The evolutionary significance of the coelom cannot be overemphasized. In addition to providing a hydrostatic skeleton and allowing new and diverse methods of locomotion, it also provides body space for storage and for complex organ development. The coelom also serves as a cushion that protects internal structures, and it allows a functional separation of the action of body wall muscles from those of internal organs, such as the muscles of the digestive tract.

Segmentation allows a high degree of specialization of body regions. This regional specialization--groups of segments modified for different functions--is seen to some degree in annelids but is a true hallmark of the body plan of arthropods, as we will see in the next section.





 Phylum Nematoda: Roundworms are nonsegmented pseudocoelomates covered by tough cuticles

Among the most widespread of all animals, roundworms (nematodes) are found in most aquatic habitats, in wet soil, in the moist tissues of plants, and in the body fluids and tissues of animals. About 90,000 species are known, and perhaps ten times that number actually exist. In contrast to annelids, the bodies of nematodes are not segmented. The cylindrical bodies of roundworms range from less than 1 mm to more than a meter in length, tapering to a fine tip at the posterior end and to a more blunt tip at the anterior (head) end (FIGURE 33.25a, p. 662). A tough exoskeleton called a cuticle covers the body; as the worm grows, it periodically sheds its old cuticle (molting, or ecdysis) and secretes a new, larger one. Nematodes have a complete digestive tract. They lack a circulatory system, but nutrients are transported throughout the body via fluid in the pseudocoelom (a body cavity only partially lined by mesoderm--see FIGURE 32.6b). The muscles of nematodes are all longitudinal, and their contraction produces a thrashing motion.

Not visible is the anus at the other end of a complete digestive tract. What looks like a corduroy coat is the worm's ridged cuticle (colorized SEM). (b) Parasitic nematode. These juveniles of Trichinella spiralis are encysted in human muscle tissue. This parasitic nematode causes trichinosis, characterized by severe nausea and sometimes death when large numbers of the juveniles penetrate heart muscle (LM).

Nematode reproduction is usually sexual. The sexes are separate in most species, females generally being larger than males. Fertilization is internal, and a female may deposit 100,000 or more fertilized eggs per day. The zygotes of most species are resistant cells capable of surviving harsh conditions.

Great numbers of nematodes live in moist soil and in decomposing organic matter on the bottoms of lakes and oceans. These extremely numerous free-living worms play an important role in decomposition and nutrient cycling, but little is known about most species. One species of soil nematode, Caenorhabitis elegans, is widely cultured and has become a model research organism in developmental biology (see Chapter 21).

Phylum Nematoda also includes many important agricultural pests that attack the roots of plants. Other species of roundworms parasitize animals. Humans host at least 50 nematode species, including various pinworms and hookworms. One notorious nematode is Trichinella spiralis, the worm that causes trichinosis (FIGURE 33.25b). Humans acquire this nematode by eating undercooked infected pork or other meat with juvenile worms encysted in the muscle tissue. Within the human intestine, the juveniles develop into sexually mature adults. Females burrow into the intestinal muscles and produce more juveniles, which bore through the body or travel in lymph vessels to encyst in other organs, including skeletal muscles.





 Arthropods are segmented coelomates with exoskeletons and jointed appendages

Zoologists estimate that the arthropod population of the world, including crustaceans, spiders, and insects, numbers about a billion billion (1018) individuals. Nearly 1 million arthropod species have been described, mostly insects. In fact, two out of every three organisms known are arthropods, and the phylum is represented in nearly all habitats of the biosphere. On the criteria of species diversity, distribution, and sheer numbers, arthropods must be regarded as the most successful of all animal phyla.

General Characteristics of Arthropods

The diversity and success of arthropods are largely related to their segmentation, hard exoskeleton, and jointed appendages. (arthropod means "jointed feet.") Groups of body segments and their appendages have become specialized for a great variety of functions. This evolutionary flexibility resulted not only in great diversification but also in an efficient body plan by the division of labor among regions. For example, the appendages are variously modified for walking, feeding, sensory reception, copulation, and defense. FIGURE 33.26 illustrates the diverse appendages and other arthropod characteristics of a lobster.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-26. External anatomy of an arthropod. Many of the distinctive features of arthropods are apparent in this dorsal view of a lobster, along with some uniquely crustacean characteristics. The whole body, including appendages, is covered by an exoskeleton. Distinct regions of the body are the head and thorax (together forming the cephalothorax) and the abdomen. The body is segmented, but this characteristic is obvious only in the abdomen. All body regions bear jointed appendages (including pincers, mouthparts, walking legs, and swimming appendages). The two pairs of sensory antennae are also jointed appendages. The head bears a pair of eyes, each situated on a movable stalk.

The body of an arthropod is completely covered by the cuticle, an exoskeleton (external skeleton) constructed from layers of protein and chitin. The cuticle can be a thick, hard armor over some parts of the body and paper-thin and flexible in other locations, such as the joints. The exoskeleton protects the animal and provides points of attachment for the muscles that move the appendages. The skeleton of arthropods is both strong and relatively impermeable to water. As we will see, both of these qualities were largely responsible for the move onto land by various arthropod groups. The rigid exoskeleton also posed some problems. For example, in order to grow, an arthropod must occasionally shed its old exoskeleton and secrete a larger one. This molting (ecdysis) is energetically expensive and leaves the animal temporarily vulnerable to predators and other dangers.

Arthropods tune in to their environment with well-developed sensory organs, including eyes, olfactory receptors for smell, and antennae for touch and smell. Cephalization is extensive, with most sensory organs concentrated at the anterior end of the animal.

Arthropods have open circulatory systems in which fluid called hemolymph is propelled by a heart through short arteries and then into spaces called sinuses surrounding the tissues and organs. (The term blood is best reserved for fluid in a closed circulatory system.) Hemolymph reenters the arthropod heart through pores that are usually equipped with valves. The body sinuses are collectively called the hemocoel, which is not part of the coelom. In most arthropods, the coelom that forms in the embryo becomes much reduced as development progresses, and the hemocoel becomes the main body cavity in adults. Although this condition resembles the open circulatory system of mollusks, the two systems probably arose independently.

A variety of organs specialized for gas exchange have evolved in arthropods. These organs must allow the diffusion of respiratory gases in spite of the exoskeleton. Most aquatic species have gills with thin feathery extensions that place an extensive surface area in contact with the surrounding water. Terrestrial arthropods generally have internal surfaces specialized for gas exchange. Most insects, for instance, have tracheal systems, branched air ducts leading into the interior from pores in the cuticle.

Arthropod Phylogeny and Classification

Molecular systematics generally supports evidence from fossils and comparative anatomy that the arthropods diverged early in their history into four main evolutionary lineages: trilobites (all extinct); chelicerates (horseshoe crabs, scorpions, ticks, spiders, and an extinct group called the eurypterids); uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, and insects); and crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, shrimps, barnacles, and many others).

Crustaceans are primarily aquatic and are believed to have evolved in the ocean. Insects, millipedes, centipedes, and most extant chelicerates diversified on land.

Chelicerates (from the Greek cheilos, lips, and cheir, arm) are named for clawlike feeding appendages called chelicerae. In contrast, uniramians and crustaceans have jawlike mandibles. They are also distinguished from chelicerates in having one or two pairs of sensory antennae and usually a pair of compound eyes (multifaceted eyes with many separate focusing elements). Uniramians have one pair of antennae and uniramous (unbranched) appendages; crustaceans have two pairs of antennae and typically biramous (branched) appendages (note the branched walking legs of the lobster in FIGURE 33.26). Chelicerates lack antennae, and most have simple eyes (eyes with a single lens).

The move onto land by arthropods was made possible in part by the exoskeleton. When the exoskeleton first evolved in the seas, its main functions were probably protection and anchorage for muscles, but it eventually helped certain arthropods live on land by solving the problems of water loss and structural support. The arthropod cuticle is relatively impermeable to water, helping prevent desiccation. The firm exoskeleton also solved the problem of support when arthropods left the buoyancy of water. Chelicerates, insects, millipedes, and centipedes diversified on land during the late Silurian and early Devonian periods, following the colonization by plants. The oldest fossil signs of terrestrial animals are tracks of extinct chelicerates (apparently eurypterids that spent at least some of their time on land) about 450 million years old. Fossilized arachnids almost as old have also been found.

Taxonomists traditionally grouped all the arthropods in one phylum, the phylum Arthropoda. TABLE 33.5, page 664, lists a few of the major arthropod classes in the context of this one-phylum tradition. However, many zoologists now prefer to split the arthropods into multiple phyla corresponding to the four great lineages: phylum Trilobita, phylum Chelicerata, phylum Uniramia, and phylum Crustacea. This trend toward splitting former taxa into a larger number of new ones, based mainly on cladistic analysis, extends to lower taxa. For example, many systematists now split what was the uniramian class Insecta into several classes. And there are other modern taxonomic issues. For instance, some systematists now question whether Uniramia is a monophyletic clade. These scientists interpret the molecular and anatomical data used to construct cladograms to mean that insects are actually more closely related to crustaceans than they are to centipedes and millipedes.

We do want you to be aware that phylogenetic trees and classifications represent hypotheses about the history of life that are presently being reconstructed in light of molecular data and other new approaches. However we don't want the current taxonomic turmoil to detract from your appreciation of life's diverse forms. The following survey of arthropods showcases a few major groups, which can be variously classified as phyla, subphyla, or classes, depending on the taxonomic scheme.

Trilobites

Among the early arthropods were the trilobites (FIGURE 33.27). They were common denizens of the shallow seas throughout the Paleozoic era but disappeared with the great Permian extinctions that ended that era, about 250 million years ago. Trilobites had pronounced segmentation, but their appendages showed little variation from segment to segment. As arthropods continued to evolve, the segments tended to fuse and become fewer in number, and the appendages became specialized for a variety of functions. (Compare the trilobite in FIGURE 33.27 with the lobster in FIGURE 33.26.)

Spiders and Other Chelicerates

The trilobites were outlasted by the eurypterids, or water scorpions. These mainly marine and freshwater predators, up to 3 m long, were chelicerates. A chelicerate has an anterior cephalothorax and a posterior abdomen. The appendages are more specialized than those of trilobites, and the most anterior appendages are modified as chelicerae (either pincers or fangs). Most of the marine chelicerates, including all of the eurypterids, are extinct; only four marine species survive today, one being the horseshoe crab (FIGURE 33.28).

The bulk of modern chelicerates are found on land in the form of class Arachnida, which includes scorpions, spiders, ticks, and mites (FIGURE 33.29). Ticks and many mites are among a large group of parasitic arthropods. Nearly all ticks are blood-sucking parasites on the body surfaces of reptiles, birds, or mammals. Parasitic mites live on or in a wide variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, including other arthropods (FIGURE 33.29c).

Fig 33-29. Arachnids. (a) Scorpions, which hunt by night, were among the first terrestrial carnivores, preying on other arthropods that fed on the early land plants. The pedipalps of scorpions are pincers specialized for defense and the capture of food. The tip of the tail bears a poisonous stinger. (b) This magnified house-dust mite is a ubiquitous scavenger in human dwellings (colorized SEM). Unlike some mites that carry disease-causing bacteria, dust mites are harmless except to people who are allergic to them. (c) Many arthropods parasitize other arthropods. In this light micrograph, the trachea (air tube) of a honeybee (an insect) is filled with parasitic mites.

Arachnids have a cephalothorax with six pairs of appendages: the chelicerae, a pair of appendages called pedipalps that usually function in sensing or feeding, and four pairs of walking legs (FIGURE 33.30). Spiders use their fanglike chelicerae, equipped with poison glands, to attack prey. As the chelicerae masticate (chew) the prey, the spider spills digestive juices onto the torn tissues. The food softens, and the spider sucks up the liquid meal.

Fig 33-30. Spiders (class Arachnida).

In most spiders, gas exchange is carried out by book lungs, stacked plates contained in an internal chamber (see FIGURE 33.30b). The extensive surface area of these respiratory organs is a structural adaptation that enhances the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the hemolymph and air.

A unique adaptation of many spiders is the ability to catch flying insects by stringing webs of silk, a protein produced as a liquid by special abdominal glands. The silk is spun by organs called spinnerets into fibers that solidify. Each spider engineers a style of web characteristic of its species and constructs the web perfectly on the first try. This complex behavior is apparently inherited. Besides building their webs from silk, various spiders use these fibers in other ways: as droplines for rapid escape, as cloth that covers eggs, and even as "gift wrapping" for food that certain male spiders offer females during courtship.

Millipedes and Centipedes

Millipedes (class Diplopoda) are wormlike, with a large number of walking legs (two pairs per segment), though fewer than the thousand their name implies (FIGURE 33.31a). They eat decaying leaves and other plant matter. Millipedes may have been among the earliest animals on land, living on mosses and primitive vascular plants.

Centipedes (class Chilopoda) are terrestrial carnivores. The head has a pair of antennae and three pairs of appendages modified as mouthparts, including the jawlike mandibles. Each segment of the trunk region has one pair of walking legs (FIGURE 33.31b). Centipedes have poison claws on the anteriormost trunk segment that paralyze prey and aid in defense.

Insects

In species diversity, insects (class Insecta) outnumber all other forms of life combined. They live in almost every terrestrial habitat and in fresh water, and flying insects fill the air. Insects are rare, though not absent, in the seas, where crustaceans are the dominant arthropods. Class Insecta is divided into about 26 orders, some of which are described in TABLE 33.6, pages 668-669. Entomology, the study of insects, is a vast field with many subspecialties, including physiology, ecology, and taxonomy.

The oldest insect fossils date back to the Devonian period, which began about 400 million years ago. However, when flight evolved during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, it spurred an explosion in insect variety. A fossil record of diverse insect mouthparts indicates that specialized feeding on gymnosperms and other Carboniferous plants also contributed to the adaptive radiation of insects. A widely held hypothesis is that the greatest diversification of insects paralleled the evolutionary radiation of flowering plants during the Cretaceous and early Tertiary periods about 60 to 65 million years ago. This view is challenged by new research suggesting that insects diversified extensively before the angiosperm radiation. Thus, during the coevolution of flowering plants and the herbivorous insects that pollinated them, insect diversity may have been more a cause of angiosperm radiation than an effect.

Flight is obviously one key to the great success of insects. An animal that can fly can escape many predators, find food and mates, and disperse to new habitats much faster than an animal that must crawl about on the ground. Many insects have one or two pairs of wings that emerge from the dorsal side of the thorax (FIGURE 33.32). Because the wings are extensions of the cuticle and not true appendages, insects can fly without sacrificing any walking legs. By contrast, the flying vertebrates--birds and bats--have one of their two pairs of walking legs modified for wings and are generally quite clumsy on the ground.

Fig 33-32. Insect flight. Insect wings, such as this dragonfly's, are not modified appendages but extensions of the cuticle. Some insects beat their wings at speeds of several hundred cycles per second by using muscles to warp the shape of the entire cuticle covering the thorax. As the wings flap, they change angles, producing lift on both the up and down strokes.

Insect wings may have first evolved as extensions of the cuticle that helped the insect body absorb heat, only later becoming organs for flight. Other views suggest that wings allowed the animals to glide from vegetation to the ground, or even served as gills in aquatic insects. Still another hypothesis is that insect wings functioned for swimming before they functioned for flight.

Dragonflies, with two similar pairs of wings, were among the first insects to fly (see FIGURE 33.32). Several insect orders that evolved later than dragonflies have modified flight equipment. The wings of bees and wasps, for instance, are hooked together and move as a single pair. Butterfly wings operate in a similar fashion because the anterior pair overlaps the posterior wings. In beetles, the posterior wings function in flight, while the anterior ones are modified as covers that protect the flight wings when the beetle is on the ground or when the beetle is burrowing.

The internal anatomy of an insect includes several complex organ systems (FIGURE 33.33). The complete digestive system is regionally specialized, with discrete organs functioning in the breakdown of food and the absorption of nutrients. Like other arthropods, an insect has an open circulatory system, with a heart pumping hemolymph through the sinuses of the hemocoel. Metabolic wastes are removed from the hemolymph by unique excretory organs called Malpighian tubules, which are outpocketings of the digestive tract. Gas exchange in insects is accomplished by a tracheal system of branched, chitin-lined tubes that infiltrate the body and carry oxygen directly to cells. The tracheal system opens to the outside of the body through spiracles, pores that can open or close to regulate air flow and limit water loss.

Fig 33-33. Anatomy of a grasshopper, an insect. The insect body has three regions: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen (top drawing). Segmentation is apparent along the thorax and abdomen, but the head segments are fused. On the insect head are one pair of antennae and a pair of compound eyes. Several pairs of appendages modified for chewing (as in grasshoppers) or for lapping, piercing, or sucking (in certain other insects) form the mouthparts. The thorax of the insect bears three pairs of walking legs. The bottom drawing identifies major internal organs.

The insect nervous system consists of a pair of ventral nerve cords with several segmental ganglia. The two cords meet in the head, where the ganglia of several anterior segments are fused into a cerebral ganglion (brain) close to the antennae, eyes, and other sense organs concentrated on the head.

Many insects undergo metamorphosis in their development. In the incomplete metamorphosis of grasshoppers and some other orders, the young resemble adults but are smaller and have different body proportions. The animal goes through a series of molts, each time looking more like an adult, until it reaches full size. Insects with complete metamorphosis have larval stages specialized for eating and growing that are known by such names as maggot, grub, or caterpillar. The larval stage looks entirely different from the adult stage, which is specialized for dispersal and reproduction. Metamorphosis from the larval stage to the adult occurs during a pupal stage (FIGURE 33.34, p. 670).

Fig 33-34. Metamorphosis of a butterfly. (a) The larva (caterpillar) spends its time eating and growing, molting as it grows. (b) After several molts, the larva encases itself in a cocoon and becomes a pupa. (c) Within the pupa, the larval tissues are broken down, and the adult is built by the division and differentiation of cells that were quiescent in the larva. (d) Finally, the adult begins to emerge from the cocoon. (e) Fluid is pumped into veins of the wings and then withdrawn, leaving the hardened veins as struts supporting the wings. Now the insect flies off and reproduces, deriving much of its nourishment from the calories stored by the feeding larva.

Reproduction in insects is usually sexual, with separate male and female individuals. Adults come together and recognize each other as members of the same species by advertising with bright colors (butterflies), sound (crickets), or odors (moths). Fertilization is generally internal. In most species, sperm cells are deposited directly into the female's vagina at the time of copulation, though in some species the male deposits a sperm packet outside the female, and the female picks it up. An internal structure in the female called the spermatheca stores the sperm, usually enough to fertilize more than one batch of eggs. Many insects mate only once in a lifetime. After mating, a female lays her eggs on an appropriate food source where the next generation can begin eating as soon as it hatches.

Animals so numerous, diverse, and widespread as insects are bound to affect the lives of all other terrestrial organisms, including humans. On one hand, we depend on bees, flies, and many other insects to pollinate our crops and orchards. On the other hand, insects are carriers for many diseases, including malaria (spread by mosquitos that carry Plasmodium; see FIGURE 28.13) and African sleeping sickness (spread by tsetse flies that carry Trypanosoma; see FIGURE 28.11). Furthermore, insects compete with humans for food. In parts of Africa, for instance, insects claim about 75%  of the crops. Trying to minimize their losses, farmers in the United States spend billions of dollars each year on pesticides, spraying crops with massive doses of some of the deadliest poisons ever invented. Try as they may, not even humans have challenged the preeminence of insects and their arthropod kin. Or, as Cornell University's Thomas Eisner, interviewed on page 24, puts it: "Bugs are not going to inherit the Earth. They own it now. So we might as well make peace with the landlord."

Crustaceans

While arachnids and insects thrived on land, crustaceans, for the most part, remained in marine and freshwater environments, where they are now represented by about 40,000 species. Crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp are the most familiar crustaceans (FIGURE 33.35).

Fig 33-35. Crustaceans. (a) This is a Sally lightfoot crab from the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. (b) Planktonic crustaceans known as krill are consumed by the ton by whales and other large suspension-feeders. (c) Barnacles are sessile crustaceans with a shell (exoskeleton) hardened by calcium carbonate. The jointed appendages projecting from the shell capture small plankton and organic particles suspended in the water.

The multiple appendages of crustaceans are extensively specialized. Lobsters and crayfish, for instance, have a toolkit of 19 pairs of appendages (see FIGURE 33.26). Crustaceans are the only arthropods with two pairs of antennae. Three or more pairs of appendages are modified as mouthparts, including the hard mandibles. Walking legs are present on the thorax, and, unlike insects, crustaceans have appendages on the abdomen. A lost appendage can be regenerated.

Small crustaceans exchange gases across thin areas of the cuticle, but larger species have gills. The circulatory system is open, with a heart pumping hemolymph through arteries into sinuses that bathe the organs. Crustaceans excrete nitrogenous wastes by diffusion through thin areas of the cuticle, but a pair of glands regulates the salt balance of the hemolymph.

Sexes are separate in most crustaceans. In the case of lobsters and crayfish, the male uses a specialized pair of appendages to transfer sperm to the reproductive pore of the female during copulation. Most aquatic crustaceans go through one or more swimming larval stages.

One of the largest groups of crustaceans (about 10,000 species), the isopods are mostly small marine species. Some are numerous at the bottom of deep oceans. Isopods also include the land-dwelling pill bugs, or wood lice, common on the undersides of moist logs and leaves.

Another group of small crustaceans, the copepods, are among the most numerous of all animals. They are important members of marine and freshwater plankton communities, eating protists and bacteria, and being eaten by many fishes.

Lobsters, crayfish, crabs, and shrimp are all relatively large crustaceans called decapods (FIGURE 33.35a). The exoskeleton, or cuticle, is hardened by calcium carbonate; the portion that covers the dorsal side of the cephalothorax forms a shield called the carapace. Most decapods are marine. Crayfish, however, live in fresh water, and some tropical crabs live on land.

The larvae of many larger-bodied crustaceans are also planktonic. A marine group known as krill are shrimplike planktonic organisms that grow to about 3 cm long (FIGURE 33.35b). A major food source for many species of whales, krill are now being harvested in great numbers by humans for food and agricultural fertilizer.

Barnacles are sessile crustaceans with parts of their cuticles hardened into shells by calcium carbonate. They feed by using their appendages to strain food from the water (FIGURE 33.35c).

How Many Times Did Segmentation Evolve in the Animal Kingdom?

Before we leave the arthropods, let's consider the evolution of one of their key anatomical characteristics, the segmentation of the body. (You can see many examples of this segmentation if you reexamine some of the arthropods in the preceding illustrations--for example, note the segmentation of the scorpion in FIGURE 33.29a and of the millipede in FIGURE 33.31a.) Until recently, based partly on this segmented body plan, the majority of biologists favored the hypothesis that arthropods evolved from an annelid ancestor, or from a segmented ancestor common to both annelids and arthropods. In placing annelids and arthropods on divergent clades of Protostomia--Lophotrochozoa for annelids, Ecdysozoa for arthropods--molecular systematists have challenged the long-held view of a close kinship between the segmented worms and the arthropods. However, many biologists do not find the existing molecular data convincing enough to reject the hypothesis of a closer annelid-arthropod relationship. The debate has focused interest on the evolutionary origin of segmentation.

The segmented bodies of arthropods, annelids, and certain other animals represent a special case of a more general phenomenon: the blocking-out of an embryo into regions where certain body parts will develop. Each bilaterally symmetrical animal has a particular linear arrangement of anatomical features along its anterior (head) to posterior axis. Eyes, for example, are located at the anterior end. Differential expression of various regulatory genes that code for transcription factors plays a key role in this blocking-out of anterior  posterior anatomy in the developing embryo. In those phyla with segmented bodies, certain genes first determine the segmentation, and then genes of the Hox complex determine what organs will develop at each segment (see FIGURE 21.15). For example, differential expression of various Hox genes along the length of a lobster embryo cause antennae to develop on a certain segment and walking legs to develop on other segments. But even in nonsegmented animals, such as flatworms, Hox genes determine where certain organs, such as eyes, develop along the animal's length. In fact, sponges have at least one Hox gene and cnidarians such as jellies have several. In a cnidarian, for example, expression of a Hox gene determines where tentacles will develop in the embryo.

Thus, as developmental determinants of morphology, Hox genes predate the origin of the bilaterians. The mechanism for the development of segmented bodies in certain animal phyla is a variation on a basic regulatory scheme that dates back to the first animals. But an increase in Hox gene number through gene duplications and mutations, along with adaptation of Hox gene function for development of segmented bodies, made it possible for a great diversity of complex animals to evolve.

Body segmentation evolved in several of the 35 animal phyla, including the annelids, arthropods, and chordates--the phylum that includes humans and other vertebrates. (The chain of vertebrae that make up your backbone is an example of this chordate segmentation.) This means that segmented animals occur in all three major clades of bilaterians: annelids are lophotrochozoans; arthropods are ecdysozoans; and chordates are deuterostomes. Each clade also includes phyla of nonsegmented animals.

Three different hypotheses can account for the scattered distribution of segmentation in the phylogenetic tree of animals. In the first hypothesis, segmentation had separate evolutionary origins in each bilaterian clade (FIGURE 33.36a). In the second hypothesis, there were two separate origins of segmentation, one for the protostomes (lophotrochozoans + ecdysozoans) and one for the deuterostomes (FIGURE 33.36b). And in the third hypothesis, segmentation evolved just once, in an ancestor common to all three bilaterian lineages (FIGURE 33.36c). Note that hypotheses 2 and 3 require evolutionary loss of segmentation in the majority of animal phyla. The principle of parsimony in cladistics would seem to favor hypothesis 1 because it requires the fewest evolutionary changes (see Chapter 25 to review cladistics and parsimony). However, application of parsimony is merely an analytical aid in cladistics, not some law of evolution that life always follows. Thus, we cannot rule out hypotheses 2 and 3 as plausible explanations for the scattered distribution of segmentation among animal phyla.

Fig 33-36. Three hypotheses for the origin of segmentation. The purple bars represent origins of segmentation, while the orange bars represent losses of segmentation.

"Evo-devo," the research field at the interface of evolutionary biology and developmental biology, may illuminate the origin(s) of segmentation. Several lab groups are investigating how various Hox genes function during the development of segmented bodies in diverse phyla. By comparing and contrasting details in how these regulatory genes block-out the segments of annelid, arthropod, and chordate embryos, this research may bring us closer to knowing whether segmentation evolved once, twice, or three times in the animal kingdom. And these studies of how segmentation develops will help systematists test various hypotheses about animal phylogeny.





 Phylum Echinodermata: Echinoderms have a water vascular system and secondary radial anatomy

Sea stars and most other echinoderms (from the Greek echin, spiny, and derma, skin) are sessile or slow-moving animals. The internal and external parts of the animal radiate from the center, often as five spokes. A thin skin covers an endoskeleton of hard calcareous plates. Most echinoderms are prickly from skeletal bumps and spines that have various functions. Unique to echinoderms is the water vascular system, a network of hydraulic canals branching into extensions called tube feet that function in locomotion, feeding, and gas exchange.

Sexual reproduction of echinoderms usually involves separate male and female individuals that release their gametes into the seawater. The radial adults develop by metamorphosis from bilateral larvae.

Given our division of eumetazoans into Radiata and Bilateria, we should explain the radial appearance of most echinoderms. The echinoderms are definitely bilaterians, not radiate animals related to cnidarians. Echinoderm larvae have bilateral symmetry. The radial anatomy of adult echinoderms is a secondary adaptation to a sessile lifestyle. And even echinoderm adults are not truly radial in their anatomy. For example, the opening (madreporite) of a sea star's water vascular system is not central, but to one side of the "star" (see FIGURE 33.38).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 33-38. Anatomy of a sea star. The surface of a sea star is covered by spines that help defend against predators and by small gills for gas exchange. Internal organs are suspended by mesenteries in a well-developed coelom. A short digestive tract runs from the mouth on the bottom of the central disk to the anus on the top of the disk. Digestive glands secrete digestive juices and aid in the absorption and storage of nutrients. The central disk has a nerve ring and nerve cords radiating from the ring into the arms. The water vascular system consists of a ring canal in the central disk and five radial canals, each running the length of an arm in a groove. The system connects to the outside by way of the sievelike madreporite. Branching from each radial canal are hundreds of hollow, muscular tube feet filled with fluid continuous with the rest of the water vascular system. Each tube foot consists of a bulblike ampulla and suckered podium (foot portion). The podium expands and extends to contact the substratum when the ampulla squeezes water into it. The podium shortens and bends when muscles in its wall contract, forcing water back into the ampulla.

The 7,000 or so echinoderms, all marine, are divided into six classes (FIGURE 33.37): Asteroidea (sea stars), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars), Crinoidea (sea lilies and feather stars), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers), and Concentricycloidea (sea daisies). The sea daisies, discovered only recently, live on waterlogged wood in the deep sea.

Fig 33-37. Echinoderms

Class Asteroidea

Sea stars have five arms (sometimes more) radiating from a central disk (FIGURE 33.37a). The undersurfaces of the arms bear tube feet, each of which can act like a suction disk. By a complex set of hydraulic and muscle actions, the suction can be created or released (FIGURE 33.38). The sea star coordinates its tube feet to adhere firmly to rocks or to creep along slowly as the tube feet extend, grip, contract, release, extend, and grip again. Sea stars also use their tube feet to grasp prey, such as clams and oysters (FIGURE 33.37b). The arms of the sea star embrace the closed bivalve, hanging on tightly by the tube feet. The sea star then turns its stomach inside-out, everting it through its mouth and into the narrow opening between the shells of the bivalve. The digestive system of the sea star secretes juices that begin digesting the soft body of the mollusk within its own shell.

Sea stars and some other echinoderms are capable of regeneration. Sea stars can regrow lost arms, and members of one genus can even regrow an entire body from a single arm.

Class Ophiuroidea

Brittle stars have distinct central disks, and the arms are long and flexible (FIGURE 33.37c). Their tube feet lack suckers, and they move by serpentine lashing of the arms. Some species are suspension-feeders; others are predators or scavengers.

Class Echinoidea

Sea urchins and sand dollars have no arms, but they do have five rows of tube feet that function in slow movement (FIGURE 33.37d). Sea urchins also have muscles that pivot their long spines, which aids in moving. The mouth of an urchin is ringed by complex jawlike structures adapted for eating seaweeds and other food. Sea urchins are roughly spherical in shape, whereas sand dollars are flattened and disk-shaped.

Class Crinoidea

Sea lilies live attached to the substratum by stalks; feather stars crawl about by using their long, flexible arms. As a group, crinoids use their arms in suspension-feeding (FIGURE 33.37e). The arms circle the mouth, which is directed upward, away from the substratum. Crinoidea is an ancient class whose evolution has been very conservative; fossilized sea lilies some 500 million years old could pass for modern members of the class.

Class Holothuroidea

On casual inspection, sea cucumbers do not look much like other echinoderms (FIGURE 33.37f). They lack spines, and the hard endoskeleton is much reduced. Sea cucumbers are elongated in the oral-aboral axis, giving them the shape for which they are named and further disguising their relationship to sea stars and sea urchins. Closer examination, however, reveals five rows of tube feet, part of the water vascular system found only in echinoderms. Some of the tube feet around the mouth are developed as feeding tentacles.





 Phylum Chordata: The chordates include two invertebrate subphyla and all vertebrates

This phylum, to which we belong, consists of two subphyla of invertebrate animals plus the subphylum Vertebrata, the animals with backbones. Grouping the chordates with echinoderms as deuterostomes on the basis of similarities in early embryonic development is not meant to imply that one phylum evolved from the other. Chordates and echinoderms have existed as distinct phyla for at least half a billion years; if the developmental similarities stem from shared ancestry, then the evolutionary paths of the two phyla must have diverged very early. We will trace the phylogeny of chordates in Chapter 34, focusing on the history of vertebrates.

TABLE 33.7 summarizes the animal phyla we have discussed in this chapter.

PRIMATES AND THE EVOLUTION OF Homo Sapiens

   Humanity is one very young twig on the vertebrate tree

Most of us are curious about our genealogies. On the personal level, we wonder about our family ancestry. As biology students, we are interested in retracing human ancestry within the broader scope of the evolutionary history of the entire animal kingdom. The questions we must ask are the following: What were our ancestors like? How are we related to other animals? What are our closest relatives? In this chapter, we trace the evolution of the vertebrates, the group that includes humans and their closest relatives. Mammals, birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, amphibians, and the various classes of fishes are all examples of vertebrates. They share many features unique to the vertebrates, including the backbone, a series of vertebrae for which the group is named. You can see this vertebrate hallmark in the above photograph of a snake skeleton. Our first step in tracking the vertebrate genealogy is to determine where vertebrates fit in the animal kingdom.





INVERTEBRATE CHORDATES AND THE ORIGIN OF VERTEBRATES

 

 Four anatomical features characterize the phylum Chordata



 

 Invertebrate chordates provide clues to the origin of vertebrates



The vertebrates are part of a phylogenetic branch of the animal kingdom consisting of deuterostomes (see FIGURE 32.4). The deuterostome branch has two main modern phyla: the chordates (which include the vertebrates) and the echinoderms. An echinoderm such as the sea star is the closest living relative of human beings among the well-known groups of invertebrates. However, the phylum Chordata itself also includes two groups of less well-known invertebrate animals: the urochordates and the cephalochordates. The urochordates and cephalochordates are therefore more closely related to us than is a sea star. FIGURE 34.1 is a cladogram of some of the animal groups we will examine during the first part of this chapter.

The upper right cladogram places the chordates in the context of bilaterian evolution (see Chapters 32 and 33); the enlarged cladogram introduces the major chordate clades we'll be discussing in the first part of the chapter. In the rest of the chapter, we'll take a closer look at the jawed vertebrates. Some of the derived characters that define certain clades are also indicated in this diagram (for example, all chordates, and only chordates, have notochords).





INTRODUCTION TO THE VERTEBRATES

 

 Neural crest, pronounced cephalization, a vertebral column, and a closed circulatory system characterize the subphylum Vertebrata



 

 An overview of vertebrate diversity



Vertebrates (subphylum Vertebrata) retain the primitive chordate characteristics but have additional specializations, shared derived features that distinguish the subphylum from invertebrate chordates. Many of the features that distinguish vertebrates are associated with larger size and an active lifestyle.





JAWLESS VERTEBRATES

 

 Class Myxini: Hagfishes are the most primitive living "vertebrates"



 

 Class Cephalaspidomorphi: Lampreys provide clues to the evolution of the vertebral column



 

 Some extinct jawless vertebrates had ossified teeth and bony armor



The two extant classes of jawless vertebrates, or agnathans (which means "without jaws"), are the hagfishes and the lampreys. These animals are eel-like in shape, but the true eels are actually bony fishes. In fact, the agnathans represent ancient vertebrate lineages that predate the origin of paired fins, teeth, and bones hardened by mineralization (ossification). Thus, agnathans provide clues about early stages in the evolution of vertebrates.





FISHES AND AMPHIBIANS

 

 Vertebrate jaws evolved from skeletal supports of the pharyngeal slits



 

 Class Chondrichthyes: Sharks and rays have cartilaginous skeletons



 

 Osteichthyes: The extant classes of bony fishes are the ray-finned fishes, the lobe-finned fishes, and the lungfishes



 

 Tetrapods evolved from specialized fishes that inhabited shallow water



 

 Class Amphibia: Salamanders, frogs, and caecilians are the three extant amphibian orders



During the late Silurian period and early Devonian period, gnathostomes largely replaced the agnathans. The two extant groups of fishes--Chondrichthyes (the cartilaginous fishes: sharks and rays) and Osteichthyes (the bony fishes: ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned fishes, and lungfishes)--first appeared during that time. There is also a substantial fossil record of the armored, jawed fishes called placoderms ("plate skinned"), which are completely extinct. Most placoderms were less than a meter long, though some giants measured more than 10 m.

In addition to jaws, fishes also have two pairs of fins, whereas agnathans either lacked paired appendages or had a single pair. By studying the developmental genetics of extant vertebrates, biologists in the "evo-devo" field have found that differential expression of some of the Hox genes may determine whether one or two sets of paired appendages develop in a vertebrate embryo (see Chapters 21 and 25).

Jaws and paired fins were major evolutionary breakthroughs in vertebrate history. Jaws are hinged structures that, especially with the help of teeth, enable the animal to grip food items firmly and slice them up. A jawed fish can exploit food supplies that were unavailable to earlier agnathans, which fed mainly on food particles suspended in the water or located on the sea bottom. Paired fins, along with the tail, enable fishes to maneuver accurately while swimming, analogous to an airplane's movements of wing flaps and tail rudder for ascending, descending, and turning. With their jaws and paired fins, many species of fishes were active predators, capable of chasing prey and biting off chunks of flesh. Thus, these modifications of the early vertebrate body plan allowed the diversification of both lifestyles and nutrient sources, which may explain why jawed fishes replaced most agnathans during the Devonian period.

 Four anatomical features characterize the phylum Chordata

Although chordates vary widely in appearance, they are distinguished as a phylum by the presence of four anatomical structures that appear at some point during the animal's lifetime, often only during embryonic development. These four chordate characteristics are a notochord; a dorsal, hollow nerve cord; pharyngeal slits; and a muscular, postanal tail (FIGURE 34.2, p. 680).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 34-2. Chordate characteristics. All chordates possess the four trademarks of the phylum: a notochord; a dorsal, hollow nerve cord; pharyngeal slits; and a muscular, postanal tail.

1. Notochord

Chordates are named for a skeletal structure, the notochord, present in all chordate embryos. The notochord is a longitudinal, flexible rod located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord. Composed of large, fluid-filled cells encased in fairly stiff, fibrous tissue, it provides skeletal support throughout most of the length of the animal. The notochord persists in the adult of some invertebrate chordates and primitive vertebrates. However, in most vertebrates a more complex, jointed skeleton develops, and the adult retains only remnants of the embryonic notochord--as gelatinous material of the disks between the vertebrae of humans, for example.

2. Dorsal, Hollow Nerve Cord

The nerve cord of a chordate embryo develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube located dorsal to the notochord. The result is a dorsal, hollow nerve cord unique to chordates. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords, usually ventrally located. The nerve cord of a chordate embryo develops into the central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord.

3. Pharyngeal Slits

The digestive tube of chordates extends from the mouth to the anus. The region just posterior to the mouth is the pharynx, which opens to the outside of the animal through several pairs of slits. These pharyngeal slits allow water that enters the mouth to exit without continuing through the entire digestive tract. The pharyngeal slits function as suspension-feeding devices in many invertebrate chordates. The slits and structures supporting them have become modified for gas exchange (in aquatic vertebrates), jaw support, hearing, and other functions during vertebrate evolution.

4. Muscular, Postanal Tail

Most chordates have a tail extending posterior to the anus. By contrast, most nonchordates have a digestive tract that extends nearly the whole length of the body. The chordate tail contains skeletal elements and muscles and provides much of the propulsive force in many aquatic species.





 Invertebrate chordates provide clues to the origin of vertebrates

Members of the two subphyla of invertebrate chordates, Urochordata and Cephalochordata, illustrate the chordate body plan in its most "stripped-down" versions--without the additional features that evolved in vertebrates. The study of urochordates and cephalochordates also provides clues to the origin of vertebrates.

Subphylum Urochordata

Urochordates are commonly called tunicates. Most tunicates are sessile marine animals that adhere to rocks, docks, and boats (FIGURE 34.3a). Others are planktonic. Some species are colonial. Seawater enters the animal through an incurrent siphon, passes through the pharyngeal slits into a chamber called the atrium, and exits through an excurrent siphon, or atriopore (FIGURE 34.3b). The food filtered from this water current by a mucous net is passed by cilia into the intestine. The anus empties into the excurrent siphon. The entire animal is cloaked in a tunic made of a celluloselike carbohydrate. Because they shoot a jet of water through the excurrent siphon when molested, tunicates are also called sea squirts.

Fig 34-3. Subphylum Urochordata: a tunicate. (a) An adult tunicate, or sea squirt, is a sessile animal commonly arranged in a U shape (photo is approximately life-sized). (b) In the adult, prominent pharyngeal slits function in suspension feeding, but the other chordate characteristics are not obvious. (c) In the tunicate larva, which is a free-swimming but nonfeeding "tadpole," the chordate characteristics are evident: It has a notochord, dorsal nerve tube, and a tail with muscle segments.

The adult tunicate scarcely resembles a chordate. It displays no trace of a notochord, nor is there a nerve cord or tail. Only the pharyngeal slits suggest a link to other chordates. But all four chordate trademarks are manifest in the larval form of some groups of tunicates (FIGURE 34.3c). The larva swims until it attaches by its head to a surface and undergoes metamorphosis, during which most of its chordate characteristics disappear.

Subphylum Cephalochordata

Known as lancelets because of their bladelike shape, cephalochordates closely resemble the idealized chordate in FIGURE 34.2. The notochord; dorsal, hollow nerve cord; numerous gill slits; and postanal tail all persist into the adult stage (FIGURE 34.4). Lancelets are small animals, only a few centimeters long, that live in the sand at the bottom of the sea in coastal regions. Globally they are rare, but they live at huge densities (over 5,000 lancelets per square meter) in a small number of places, including one at Tampa Bay, Florida. Lancelets wriggle backward into the sand, leaving only their anterior end exposed. A mucous net secreted across the pharyngeal slits traps tiny food particles from seawater drawn into the mouth by ciliary pumping. The water exits through the slits, and the trapped food passes down the digestive tube. Animals such as lancelets that feed on small particles suspended in the water are called suspension feeders, and early chordates, until the evolution of fishes with jaws and teeth, were all suspension feeders. In the lancelet, the pharynx and gill slits are feeding structures, and only to a minor extent respiratory structures; gas exchange takes place mainly across regions of the external body surface.

Fig 34-4. Subphylum Cephalochordata: the lancelet Branchiostoma. (a) This small invertebrate displays all four chordate characteristics. The pharyngeal slits function in suspension feeding. Water passes into the pharynx and through slits into the atrium, a chamber that vents to the outside via the atriopore. Food particles trapped by mucus are swept by cilia into the digestive tract. (b) The muscle segments you can see in this photo of a lancelet produce the sinusoidal swimming of these animals.

A lancelet frequently leaves its burrow and swims to a new location. Though feeble swimmers, these invertebrate chordates display, in simple form, the swimming mechanism of fishes. Coordinated contraction of muscles serially arranged like rows of chevrons (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) along the sides of the notochord flexes the notochord, producing side-to-side undulations that thrust the body forward. This serial musculature is evidence of the lancelet's segmentation. The muscle segments develop from blocks of mesoderm called somites arranged along each side of the notochord of a chordate embryo. Chordates are segmented animals.

The Relationship Between Invertebrate Chordates and Vertebrates

Molecular evidence suggests that the cephalochordates are the vertebrates' closest relatives, and urochordates are their next closest relatives (see FIGURE 34.1). According to one hypothesis, there were two stages in the evolution of vertebrates from invertebrates: In the first stage, an ancestral cephalochordate evolved from a form resembling a modern urochordate larva; in the second stage, a vertebrate evolved from a cephalochordate. The first stage may have been preceded by paedogenesis, the precocious development of sexual maturity in a larva (see Chapter 24). Notice that a cephalochordate appears more akin to a urochordate larva than to an adult urochordate (compare FIGURES 34.3 and 34.4). Changes in genes controlling development can alter the timing of developmental events, such as the maturation of gonads. Perhaps such a change occurred in the ancestor of cephalochordates and vertebrates, causing the gonads to mature in swimming larvae before the onset of metamorphosis to the sessile adult form. If reproducing larvae were very successful, natural selection may have reinforced paedo genesis and eliminated metamorphosis.

There is no fossil evidence to support or contradict the paedogenetic hypothesis; it is deduced from comparing modern forms. But fossil evidence does tell us something about the second stage, from cephalochordate to vertebrate. In 1999, paleontologists reported that fossils from a site in China support the idea that cephalochordates are the closest relatives of vertebrates. The 530-million-year-old fossils appear to blur the distinction between cephalochordates and vertebrates by showing a series of "missing links" (FIGURE 34.5). Vertebrates, as we consider further below, differ from lancelets in having a much more elaborate brain--an enlargement of the nerve cord at the anterior end--and a braincase, or cranium. One Chinese fossil, Haikouella, seems to have a brain but may lack a cranium (skull). It also (unlike the lancelet) has eyes, and hardened structures called "denticles" in its pharynx, which may have functioned somewhat like teeth. Otherwise, Haikouella resembles the lancelet. It has tentacles around its mouth and was probably a suspension feeder. This animal had some vertebrate characteristics (brain) but not others (cranium). Another Chinese fossil from the same area, Haikouichthys, seems to have a cranium and may be the earliest fossil with a full set of vertebrate characteristics. The discovery of these Chinese fossils pushes the origin of vertebrates back to the Cambrian explosion (see Chapter 32).

Fig 34-5. Early fossil vertebrates. These fossils were discovered in 1999 near the town of Haikou in southern China. They date back to the early Cambrian period, about 530 million years ago. (a) Fossils of Haikouella are about 2-3 cm long. Based on detailed study of over 300 specimens fossilized in a variety of body positions, researchers have been able to describe many anatomical details of this species. Haikouella resembled a modern cephalochordate, but with such vertebrate characters as eyes, mineralized toothlike structures, and what seems to be an enlarged brain. However, there is no evidence of a cranium (braincase), a character found in all true modern vertebrates. Thus, Haikouella may represent animals that were transitional in the evolution of vertebrates from invertebrate chordates. (b) Haikouichthys, about the same size as Haikouella, probably had a cranium, making it a full-fledged vertebrate. (c) Based on fossils from the same Chinese sediments, an artist reconstructed Myllokunmingia, which is very similar to Haikouichthys. These earliest known vertebrates, in contrast to lancelets (cephalochordates), were more mobile and were probably predators rather than suspension feeders.





 Neural crest, pronounced cephalization, a vertebral column, and a closed circulatory system characterize the subphylum Vertebrata

The dorsal, hollow nerve cord found in all chordates develops when the edges of an ectodermal plate on the surface of the embryo roll together to form the neural tube. In vertebrates, a group of embryonic cells called the neural crest forms near the dorsal margins of the closing neural tube (FIGURE 34.6). A distinctive feature of vertebrates, the neural crest contributes to the formation of certain skeletal elements, such as some of the bones and cartilage of the cranium (braincase), and many other structures that distinguish vertebrates from other chordates.

Fig 34-6. The neural crest, embryonic source of many unique vertebrate characters. (a) The neural crest consists of bilateral bands of cells near the margins of the embryonic folds that meet to form the dorsal, hollow nerve cord (neural tube). (b) Cells from the neural crest migrate to distant sites in the embryo, where they give rise to some of the anatomical structures unique to vertebrates, including some of the bones and cartilage of the skull.

The vertebrate cranium and brain (which is the enlarged anterior end of the dorsal, hollow nerve cord), along with the eyes, ears, and nose, are evidence of an important evolutionary feature of vertebrates--a high degree of cephalization, the concentration of sensory and neural equipment in the head (see Chapter 32).

Note in FIGURE 34.1 that these vertebrate characteristics are present in the animals called hagfishes, but the hagfishes lack a backbone of vertebrae. Therefore, the cladogram in FIGURE 34.1 nests the vertebrate clade within a larger clade, Craniata, which is named for the cranium and includes the hagfishes. However, we will include hagfishes in our survey of vertebrates, with the caveat that they represent an ancient branch of Craniata that predates the origin of the vertebral column.

The cranium and vertebral column, surrounding and protecting the nerve cord, are parts of the vertebrate axial skeleton, the main support structure for the axis, or central trunk, of the body. The axial skeleton helps make large body size and strong, fast movement possible. The axial skeleton of most vertebrates also includes ribs, which anchor muscles and protect internal organs. Most vertebrates also have an appendicular skeleton, supporting two pairs of appendages (fins, legs, or arms).

The vertebrate endoskeleton is made of bone or more flexible cartilage, or most commonly some combination of these two materials. Although the skeleton consists mostly of a nonliving matrix, living cells within the skeleton secrete and maintain the materials of the matrix. The endoskeleton of a vertebrate can grow with the animal, unlike the nonliving exoskeleton of arthropods, which must be periodically shed and rebuilt as the animal grows.

When vertebrates move in pursuit of food or when escaping predators, they regenerate their ATP supply mainly by cellular respiration, which consumes oxygen. Adaptations of the vertebrate respiratory and circulatory systems support busy mitochondria in muscle cells and other active tissues. Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system, with a ventral, chambered heart that pumps blood through arteries to microscopic vessels called capillaries that branch throughout every tissue in the body. The blood is oxygenated as it passes through capillaries in gills or lungs.

A vigorous lifestyle also requires a relatively large supply of organic fuel. Vertebrate adaptations for feeding, digestion, and nutrient absorption help support active behavior. For example, muscles in the walls of the digestive tract propel food from organ to organ along the tract. These are all examples of vertebrate form and function having their historical basis in the transition from a relatively sedentary lifestyle to a more active one.





 An overview of vertebrate diversity

FIGURE 34.7 (p. 684) is a hypothetical cladogram of extant (living) vertebrates based on a combination of anatomical, molecular, and fossil evidence. Two groups, the hagfishes and the lampreys, lack hinged jaws. All the other vertebrates are grouped in FIGURE 34.7 within the clade identified as the gnathostomes (which means "jawed mouth"). In addition to jaws, gnathostomes also have two sets of paired appendages. Among these jawed vertebrates, there are various classes of aquatic animals that we generally call "fishes": the cartilaginous fishes (sharks and rays) and three classes of bony fishes (the ray-fins, lobe-fins, and lungfishes). In the case of fishes, the two sets of paired appendages are fins that function in swimming. All the other gnathostomes are tetrapods ("four footed"), in which the two sets of paired appendages are modified as legs that can support the animals on land. The tetrapods include the amphibians (frogs and salamanders) along with the clade identified as amniotes in FIGURE 34.7. The amniotes are named for the amniotic egg, which is a shelled, water-retaining egg (think of grocery store eggs, which are laid by birds). The amniotic egg functions as a "self-contained pond" that enables amniotes to complete their life cycles on land. Although most modern mammals don't lay eggs, they retain many other key features of the amniotic mode of reproduction. Note that the amniotes we customarily lump together as "reptiles" (turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and alligators) do not represent a clade (monophyletic group)--unless we also include the birds.

With the cladogram in FIGURE 34.7 as our guide, let's now take a closer look at the major vertebrate groups.





 Class Myxini: Hagfishes are the most primitive living "vertebrates"

There are about 30 species of hagfishes, all of them marine. They are mainly bottom-dwelling scavengers, ingesting such food as worms and sick or dead fish. Rows of slime glands on a hagfish's flanks secrete a gooey substance (FIGURE 34.8). The glands produce small amounts of the slime when a hagfish is feeding, a behavior that may repulse other scavengers. But when a hagfish is attacked by a potential predator, it can secrete enough water-absorbing goo to form several liters of slime in less than a minute. The slime can coat the gills of a predatory fish, sending it into retreat or even suffocating it.

Fig 34-8. A hagfish.

The skeleton of a hagfish is made entirely of cartilage, a rubbery connective tissue (see FIGURE 40.2). In addition to the cartilaginous cranium (skull), a strong but flexible rod of cartilage (which is actually the notochord) extends the length of the body, much like the notochords of lancelets (cephalochordates). The hagfish notochord provides support and a skeleton against which muscles can exert force to drive the animal's serpentine (snakelike) swimming.

Hagfishes do not have vertebrae, and so, as we pointed out earlier, these chordates are only included with vertebrates if we equate the subphylum Vertebrata with the clade marked Craniata in FIGURE 34.1. Until recently, a popular hypothesis was that hagfishes lost their vertebrae secondarily during their descent from an ancestor with a true vertebral column. However, more detailed study has convinced most zoologists that the hagfish skeleton is truly primitive. In fact, hagfishes are now considered to be the most primitive living vertebrates (or craniates), diverging from the vertebrate lineage about 530 million years ago, during the early Cambrian.





 Class Cephalaspidomorphi: Lampreys provide clues to the evolution of the vertebral column

There are about 35 species of lampreys inhabiting both marine and freshwater environments. The sea lamprey (FIGURE 34.9) feeds by clamping its round mouth onto the flank of a live fish, using a rasping tongue to penetrate the skin of its prey, and ingesting the prey's blood. Sea lampreys live as larvae for years in freshwater streams and then migrate to the sea or lakes as they mature into adults. The larva is a suspension feeder that resembles the lancelets (cephalochordates). Some species of lampreys feed only as larvae. Following several years in streams, they attain sexual maturity, reproduce, and die within a few days.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 34-9. A sea lamprey. Acting as both a predator and a parasite, a lamprey uses this rasping mouth (inset) to bore a hole in the side of a fish, living on the blood and other tissues of its host.

The notochord of lampreys persists as the main axial skeleton in the adult animal, as it does in hagfishes. However, a lamprey also has a cartilaginous pipe surrounding the rodlike notochord. Along the length of this pipe, pairs of cartilaginous projections extend upward (dorsally), partially enclosing the nerve cord with what may be a vestige of an early stage in the evolution of the vertebral column.

Note again that both hagfishes and lampreys not only lack skeleton-supported jaws but also lack paired appendages. And the skeletons of hagfishes and lampreys are made entirely of cartilage. In contrast, the skeletons of most jawed vertebrates are ossified (hardened with minerals) as bone. In the gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), the notochord is a larval structure, largely replaced during development by the segmental vertebrae that make up the backbone.

Thus, anatomical comparison of agnathans with gnatho stomes indicates that the brain and braincase (cranium) evolved first in the vertebrate lineage, followed by the vertebral column, with the jaws, ossified skeleton, and paired appendages evolving later. Analysis of the early Cambrian fossils in Chinese strata is consistent with this interpretation (see FIGURE 34.5).





 Some extinct jawless vertebrates had ossified teeth and bony armor

Jawless vertebrates are much more diverse and common in the fossil record than they are among today's fauna. A diversity of taxa informally called ostracoderms thrived from about 450 to 375 million years ago, from the Ordovician period to the late Devonian. Most species were small, less than 50 cm in length. Most lacked paired fins and apparently were bottom dwellers that wiggled along streambeds or the seafloor, but there were also some more active species with paired fins. Their mouths were circular or slitlike openings that lacked jaws. The majority of ostracoderms were probably mud-suckers or suspension feeders that took in sediments or suspended organic debris through their mouths and then passed it through the gill slits, where food was trapped. Thus, the pharyngeal apparatus retained the primitive feeding function, although gills in agnathans had probably also evolved into the major sites of gas exchange. The ostracoderms and most other agnathan groups declined and finally disappeared during the Devonian period.

Fossils of the extinct agnathans provide evidence that the process of mineralization of certain body structures evolved early in vertebrate history. Ostracoderm means "shelled skin," a reference to the armor of bony plates that encased these animals. The plates may represent an early evolutionary stage of ossification, the hardening of connective tissue that occurs when specialized cells secrete calcium and phosphate, which precipitate as calcium phosphate, a hard mineral salt. Even earlier evidence of ossification is found in fossils of ancient vertebrates called conodonts, which date back as far as 510 million years. These vertebrates are named for their coneshaped toothlike structures, which were ossified. In contrast, the mouths of hagfishes contain toothlike structures made mainly of keratin, a structural protein.

Based on cladistic analysis, most vertebrate systematists now agree that hagfishes and lampreys, though still represented in the modern fauna, are actually more primitive as vertebrates than were the conodonts and ostracoderms. The jawed vertebrates probably evolved from one of the many lineages of ostracoderms.





 Vertebrate jaws evolved from skeletal supports of the pharyngeal slits

Vertebrate jaws evolved by modification of the skeletal rods that had previously supported the anterior pharyngeal (gill) slits (FIGURE 34.10). The remaining gill slits, no longer required for suspension feeding, remained as the major sites of respiratory gas exchange with the external environment. The origin of vertebrate jaws from these skeletal parts illustrates a general feature of evolutionary change: New adaptations usually evolve by the modification of existing structures. As a mechanism of adaptation, evolution is limited by the raw material with which it must work. Evolution is generally more of a remodeling process than a creative one.

Fig 34-10. Hypothesis for the evolution of vertebrate jaws. The skeleton of the jaws and their supports evolved from two pairs of skeletal rods located between gill slits that were near the mouth. Pairs of rods anterior to those that formed the jaws were either lost or incorporated into the jaws.

The Devonian period (about 360 to 400 million years ago) has been called the "age of fishes," when the placoderms and another group of jawed fishes called acanthodians radiated and many new forms evolved in both fresh and salt water. Placoderms and acanthodians dwindled and disappeared almost completely by the beginning of the Carboniferous period, about 360 million years ago. An ancestor common to the placoderms and acanthodians may also have given rise to sharks and bony fishes some 425 to 450 million years ago. Sharks and bony fishes are currently the main vertebrates in the watery two-thirds of the surface of Earth.





 Class Chondrichthyes: Sharks and rays have cartilaginous skeletons

The vertebrates of the class Chondrichthyes, sharks and their relatives, are called cartilaginous fishes because they have relatively flexible endoskeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. However, in most species, parts of the skeleton are strengthened by mineralized granules, and the teeth are bony. There are about 750 extant species in this class. Jaws and paired fins are well developed in the cartilaginous fishes. The largest and most diverse subclass consists of the sharks and rays. A second subclass is composed of a few dozen species of unusual fishes called chimaeras, or ratfishes.

The cartilaginous skeleton of these fishes is a derived characteristic, not a primitive one; that is, the ancestors of Chondrichthyes had bony skeletons, and the cartilaginous skeleton characteristic of the class evolved secondarily. During the development of most vertebrates, the skeleton is first cartilaginous and then becomes bony (ossified) as hard calcium phos phate matrix replaces the rubbery matrix of cartilage. Apparently, some modification in the developmental process of cartilaginous fishes prevents the replacement process.

Most sharks have streamlined bodies (FIGURE 34.11a, p. 688). They are swift swimmers, but they do not maneuver very well. Powerful swimming muscles, especially in the caudal (tail) fin, propel them forward. The dorsal fins function mainly as stabilizers, and the paired pectoral (fore) and pelvic (hind) fins provide lift in the water. Although a shark gains additional buoyancy by storing a large amount of oil in its huge liver, the animal is still denser than water, and it sinks if it stops swimming. Continual swimming also ensures that water will flow into the mouth and out through the gills, where gas exchange occurs. However, some sharks and many skates and rays spend a good deal of time resting on the seafloor. When doing so, these fishes use muscles of the jaws and pharynx to pump water over the gills.

Fig 34-11. Cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes). (a) Blacktip reef shark. Fast swimmers with acute senses, sharks, such as this blacktip reef shark, have paired pectoral and pelvic fins. (b) Great white shark. A great white shark displays its hinged jaws and toothy mouth, which complement the animal's mobility and sensory equipment as adaptations for a predatory way of life. (c) Blue-spotted stingray. Most rays, such as the blue-spotted stingray, are flattened bottom dwellers that crush mollusks and crustaceans for food. Some other species cruise in open water, scooping food into their gaping mouths.

The largest sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton. Most sharks, however, are carnivores that swallow their prey whole or use their powerful jaws and sharp teeth to tear flesh from animals too large to swallow in one piece (FIGURE 34.11b). Shark teeth probably evolved from the jagged scales that cover the abrasive skin. The digestive tract of many sharks is proportionately shorter than the digestive tube of many other vertebrates. Within the shark intestine is a spiral valve, a corkscrew-shaped ridge that increases surface area and prolongs the passage of food along the short digestive tract.

Acute senses are adaptations that go along with the active, carnivorous lifestyle of sharks. Sharks have sharp vision but cannot distinguish colors. The nostrils of sharks, like those of most fishes, open into dead-end cups. They function only for olfaction (smelling), not for breathing. Along with eyes and nostrils, the shark head also has a pair of regions in the skin that can detect electrical fields generated by the muscle contractions of nearby animals. Running the length of each flank of the shark is the lateral line system, a row of microscopic organs sensitive to changes in the surrounding water pressure. A primitive feature and present in most species of aquatic vertebrates, the lateral line system enables the animal to detect minor vibrations. Sharks and other fishes have no eardrums, structures that terrestrial vertebrates use to transmit sound waves traveling through air into the ear toward the auditory organs. Sound reaches the shark through water, and the animal's entire body transmits the sound to the hearing organs of the inner ear.

Shark eggs are fertilized internally. The male has a pair of claspers on its pelvic fins that transfer sperm into the reproductive tract of the female. Some species of sharks are oviparous; they lay eggs that hatch outside the mother's body. These sharks release their eggs after encasing them in protective coats. Other species are ovoviviparous; they retain the fertilized eggs in the oviduct. Nourished by the egg yolk, the embryos develop into young that are born after hatching within the uterus. A few species are viviparous; the young develop within the uterus, nourished prior to birth by nutrients received from the mother's blood through a placenta. The reproductive tract of the shark empties along with the excretory system and digestive tract into the cloaca, a common chamber that expels through a single vent.

Although rays are closely related to sharks, they have adopted a very different lifestyle. Most rays are flattened bottom dwellers that feed by using their jaws to crush mollusks and crustaceans (FIGURE 34.11c). A ray's pectoral fins are greatly enlarged and used like water wings to propel the animal through the water. The tail of many rays is whiplike and, in some species, bears venomous barbs that function in defense.





 Osteichthyes: The extant classes of bony fishes are the ray-finned fishes, the lobe-finned fishes, and the lungfishes

Of all vertebrate groups, bony fishes are the most numerous, both in individuals and in species (about 30,000). Ranging in size from about 1 cm to more than 6 m long, bony fishes are abundant in the seas and in nearly every freshwater habitat (FIGURE 34.12).

Fig 34-12. Ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii). (a) Yellow perch (b) Long-snouted sea horse

Until recently, zoologists combined all bony fishes into a single vertebrate class (Osteichthyes), and we'll continue to use that name as a general, informal one for the great diversity of bony fishes. However, based on cladistic analysis, most vertebrate systematists now recognize three extant classes of bony fishes: the ray-finned fishes, the lobe-finned fishes, and the lungfishes (see FIGURE 34.7).

Nearly all bony fishes have an ossified endoskeleton with a hard matrix of calcium phosphate. The skin is often covered by flattened, bony scales that differ in structure from the toothlike scales of sharks. Glands in the skin of a bony fish secrete a mucus that gives the animal its characteristic sliminess, an adaptation that reduces drag during swimming. In common with sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system clearly evident as a row of tiny pits in the skin on either side of the body (FIGURE 34.13).

Fig 34-13. Anatomy of a trout, a representive ray-finned fish.

Bony fishes breathe by drawing water over four or five pairs of gills located in chambers covered by a protective flap called the operculum. Water is drawn into the mouth, through the pharynx, and out between the gills by movement of the operculum and contraction of muscles surrounding the gill chambers. This process enables a bony fish to breathe while stationary.

Another adaptation of most bony fishes not found in sharks is the swim bladder, an air sac that helps control the buoyancy of the fish. The transfer of gases between the swim bladder and the blood varies the inflation of the bladder and adjusts the density of the fish. Thus, many bony fishes, in contrast to most sharks, can conserve energy by remaining almost motionless. Swim bladders evolved from balloonlike lungs, which the ancestral bony fishes may have used to supplement gas exchange by gills in shallow water.

Bony fishes are generally maneuverable swimmers, their flexible fins better for steering and propulsion than the stiffer fins of sharks. The fastest bony fishes can swim in short bursts of up to 80 km/hr.

Details about the reproduction of bony fishes vary extensively. Most species are oviparous, reproducing by external fertilization after the female sheds large numbers of small eggs. However, internal fertilization and birthing characterize other species.

Both cartilaginous and bony fishes diversified extensively during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, but whereas sharks arose in the sea, bony fishes probably originated in fresh water. Swim bladders were modified from simple lungs that had augmented the gills in gas exchange, perhaps in stagnant swamps with low oxygen content. The three classes of bony fishes that exist today had diverged by the end of the Devonian.

Nearly all the families of fishes familiar to us are ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii; Gr. aktin, "ray," and pteryg, "wing" or "fin"). The various species of bass, trout, perch, tuna, and herring are examples. The fins, supported mainly by long flexible rays, are modified for maneuvering, defense, and other functions (see FIGURE 34.12a). Ray-finned fishes spread from fresh water to the seas during their long history. (Adaptations that solve the osmotic problems of this move to salt water are discussed in Chapter 44.) Numerous species of ray-finned fishes returned to fresh water at some point in their evolution. Some of these, including salmon and sea-run trout, replay their evolutionary round-trip from fresh water to seawater back to fresh water during their life cycle.

In contrast to the ray-fins, lobe-finned fishes (class Actinistia) have muscular pectoral and pelvic fins supported by extensions of the bony skeleton. Known mainly from the fossil record, many lobe-fins were large, apparently bottom dwellers that may have used their paired, muscular fins as aids to "walking" on the substrate under water. Lobe-finned fishes are represented today by only one known genus, the coelacanth (Latimeria) (FIGURE 34.14). A population of coelacanths inhabiting waters near Indonesia may represent a different species than the only other known populations, which live in deep waters off the coasts of Madagascar and South Africa. Although most Devonian lobe-fins were probably freshwater animals with lungs, Latimeria belongs to a lineage that entered the seas at some point in its evolution.

Fig 34-14. A coelocanth (Latimeria), the only extant lobe-finned genus.

Three genera of lungfishes (class Dipnoi) live today in the Southern Hemisphere. They generally inhabit stagnant ponds and swamps, surfacing to gulp air into lungs connected to the pharynx of the digestive tract. Lungfishes also have gills, which are the main organs for gas exchange in Australian lungfishes. When ponds shrink during the dry season, some lungfishes can burrow in the mud and aestivate (wait in a state of torpor).

Although most lineages of lungfishes died out, these groups were dominant predators in shallow freshwater habitats during the Devonian. They were also of great importance in vertebrate evolution; the ancestor of amphibians and all other tetrapods was probably one of these Devonian bony fishes.





 Tetrapods evolved from specialized fishes that inhabited shallow water

Amphibians were the first tetrapods to spend a substantial portion of their time on land. But if we define tetrapods as vertebrates that have relatively sturdy, skeleton-supported legs instead of paired fins, then the first animals to qualify were highly specialized fishes that lived in shallow aquatic habitats (FIGURE 34.15). And for the name tetrapod to identify a monophyletic lineage (clade), with legs as the key derived homology, then we must include these ancestral fishes.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 34-15. The origin of tetrapods. Many of the intermediate fossils on which this cladogram is based have been discovered only recently. The bars on the branches place the known fossils in time (arrows indicate lineages that extend to today). In this artist's recreation of the extinct animals, the body forms are based on fossilized skeletons, but the colors are fanciful artistic touches.

During the Devonian period, a diversity of plants and arthropods already inhabited the land, and the evolution of trees and other large vegetation was transforming these terrestrial ecosystems. Plants rooted at the margins of ponds and swamps and organic material that dropped into the water from the terrestrial ecosystems also created new living conditions and new food supplies for fishes living near water's edge. A diversity of fishes resembling modern lobe-fins and lungfishes had already evolved. Both modern lungfishes and frogs breathe air by a mechanism called buccal pumping rather than using the rib cage, as we do. In buccal breathing, the animal drops the floor of the mouth, which sucks air in, then closes the mouth and raises the floor, forcing air into the lungs. In addition to lungs that supplemented gills for gas exchange at water's edge, leglike appendages were probably better equipment than fins for paddling and crawling through the dense vegetation in shallow water. Thus, the lungs and appendages of tetrapods evolved in certain specialized fishes tens of millions of years before this equipment was used by the earliest amphibians to live on land.

The fossil record chronicles this transition, over a 50-million-year period from 400 to 350 million years ago, from sturdy-finned fishes such as Eusthenopteron to tetrapod fishes to amphibians (see FIGURE 34.15). For example, fossils of Acanthostega have the bony supports of gills but also have four appendages with the same basic skeletal elements as the walking limbs of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, including humans (FIGURE 34.16). Though Acanthostega was aquatic--it was a fish--it represents a period of vertebrate evolution when adaptations that equipped certain fishes for shallow water preadapted one lineage of those fishes for a gradual transition to spending more and more time walking and breathing on the terrestrial side of water's edge.

Fig 34-16. Skeleton of Acanthostega, a Devonian tetrapod fish. This vertebrate was a fish-- an aquatic vertebrate with gills as an adult-- but its appendages had the tetrapod skeletal structure. Early amphibians had very similar skeletons.

As the earliest terrestrial tetrapods, amphibians benefited from an abundance of food and relatively little competition. An adaptive radiation gave rise to a great diversity of amphibians during the early Carboniferous period, and in fact, the Carboniferous is sometimes called the "age of amphibians." Amphibians began to decline in numbers and diversity during the late Carboniferous. As the Mesozoic era dawned with the Triassic period, about 245 million years ago, most surviving lineages of amphibians resembled modern species.





 Class Amphibia: Salamanders, frogs, and caecilians are the three extant amphibian orders

Today the amphibians (class Amphibia) are represented by a total of about 4,800 species of salamanders (order Urodela, which means "tailed ones"), frogs (order Anura,"tail-less ones"), and caecilians (order Apoda, meaning "legless ones," describing the wormlike bodies of these amphibians).

There are only about 500 species of urodeles. Some are entirely aquatic, but others live on land as adults or throughout life (FIGURE 34.17a). Most salamanders that live on land walk with a side-to-side bending of the body that may resemble the swagger of the early terrestrial tetrapods.

Fig 34-17. Amphibian orders. (a) Order Urodela. Urodeles (salamanders) retain their tails as adults. Some are entirely aquatic, but others live on land. This is a spotted salamander. (b) Order Anura. Anurans, such as this poison arrow frog, lack tails as adults. Poison arrow frogs inhabit tropical forests; their skin glands secrete deadly nerve toxins used by Central and South American natives to coat arrow tips. (c) Order Apoda. Apodans, also called caecilians, are legless, mainly burrowing amphibians.

Anurans, numbering nearly 4,200 species, are more specialized than urodeles for moving on land (FIGURE 34.17b). Adult frogs use their powerful hind legs to hop along the terrain. A frog nabs insects by flicking out its long sticky tongue, which is attached to the front of the mouth. Frogs display a great variety of adaptations that help them avoid being eaten by larger predators. In common with other amphibians, many frogs exhibit color patterns that camouflage. The skin glands of frogs secrete distasteful, or even poisonous, mucus. Many poisonous species have bright coloration that apparently warns predators, who associate the coloration with danger.

Apodans, the caecilians (about 150 species), are legless and nearly blind, and superficially resemble earthworms (FIGURE 34.17c). The reduction of legs evolved secondarily from a legged ancestor. Caecilians inhabit tropical areas where most species burrow in moist forest soil. A few South American apodans live in freshwater ponds and streams.

Amphibian means "two lives," a reference to the metamorphosis of many frogs (FIGURE 34.18). The tadpole, the larval stage of a frog, is usually an aquatic herbivore with gills, a lateral line system resembling that of fishes, and a long finned tail. The tadpole lacks legs and swims by undulating like its fishlike ancestors. During the metamorphosis that leads to the "second life," legs develop, and the gills and lateral line system disappear. The young frog with air-breathing lungs, a pair of external eardrums, and a digestive system adapted to a carnivorous diet crawls onto shore and begins life as a terrestrial hunter. In spite of the name amphibian, however, many frogs do not go through the aquatic tadpole stage, and many amphibians do not live a dualistic--aquatic and terrestrial--life. There are some strictly aquatic and strictly terrestrial frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. Moreover, salamander and caecilian larvae look much like adults, and typically both the larvae and the adults are carnivorous. Paedomorphosis is common among some groups of salamanders; the mudpuppy (Necturus), for instance, retains gills and other larval features when sexually mature (see FIGURE 24.21).

They have a jelly coat but lack shells and would desiccate in air. (b) The tadpole is an aquatic herbivore with a fishlike tail and internal gills. (c) During metamorphosis, the gills and tail are resorbed, and walking legs develop.

Most amphibians maintain close ties with water and are most abundant in damp habitats such as swamps and rain forests. Even those frogs that are adapted to drier habitats spend much of their time in burrows or under moist leaves, where the humidity is high. Most amphibians rely heavily on their moist skin to carry out gas exchange with the environment. Some terrestrial species lack lungs and breathe exclusively through their skin and oral cavity.

Amphibian eggs lack a shell and dehydrate quickly in dry air. Fertilization is external in most species, with the male grasping the female and spilling his sperm over the eggs as the female sheds them (see FIGURE 34.18a). Amphibians generally lay their eggs in ponds or swamps or at least in moist environments. Some species lay vast numbers of eggs in temporary pools, and mortality is high. In contrast, some species display various types of parental care and lay relatively few eggs. Depending on the species, either males or females may house eggs on their back, in the mouth, or even in the stomach. Certain tropical tree frogs stir their egg masses into moist foamy nests that resist drying. There are also some ovoviviparous and viviparous species that retain the eggs in the female reproductive tract, where embryos can develop without drying out.

Many amphibians exhibit complex and diverse social behavior, especially during their breeding seasons. Frogs are usually quiet creatures, but many species fill the air with their mating calls during the breeding season. Males may vocalize to defend breeding territory or to attract females. In some terrestrial species, migrations to specific breeding sites may involve vocal communication, celestial navigation, or chemical signaling.

For the past 25 years, zoologists have been documenting a rapid and alarming decline in amphibian populations throughout the world. The causes may be multiple, including environmental degradation and spread of a pathogen, a chytrid fungus. The environmental assaults include acid precipitation, which is especially damaging to amphibians because of their dependence on wet places for completing their life cycles.





 Evolution of the amniotic egg expanded the success of vertebrates on land

The amniote clade consists of the mammals, the birds, and the vertebrates we commonly call reptiles, including turtles, lizards, snakes, and crocodiles.

The evolution of amniotes from an amphibian ancestor involved many adaptations for terrestrial living. The amniotic egg, a reproductive adaptation that enabled terrestrial vertebrates to complete their life cycles on land and sever their last ties with their aquatic origins, was a particularly important breakthrough. (Seeds played a similar role in the evolution of land plants, as you learned in Chapter 29.) In contrast to the shell-less eggs of amphibians, amniotic eggs (of birds, most reptiles, and some mammals) have a shell that retains water and can therefore be laid in a dry place. The shells of bird eggs are calcareous (made of calcium carbonate) and inflexible, while the shells of many reptile eggs are leathery and flexible. Most mammals have dispensed with the shell; instead, the embryo implants in the wall of the uterus and obtains its nutrients from the mother.

Reptiles, birds, and mammals all have specialized membranes within the amniotic egg (FIGURE 34.19). Called extra embryonic membranes because they are not part of the body of the developing animal, these structures function in gas exchange, waste storage, and the transfer of stored nutrients to the embryo. They develop from tissue layers that grow out from the embryo. The amniotic egg is named for one of these membranes, the amnion, which encloses a compartment of amniotic fluid that bathes the embryo and acts as a hydraulic shock absorber. The amniotes also show other adaptations to terrestrial life, including waterproof skin and increasing use of the rib cage to ventilate the lungs.

Fig 34-19. The amniotic egg. The embryos of reptiles, birds, and mammals form four extraembryonic membranes: the amnion, yolk sac, allantois, and chorion. The shell is waterproof, an adaptation that prevents the embryo and the fluid compartments around it from drying out on land. This drawing represents the extraembryonic membranes in the shelled egg of a reptile or bird. Mammals have the four extraembryonic membranes, but in most species the embryos develop without shells in the reproductive tract of the mother.





 Vertebrate systematists are reevaluating the classification of amniotes

FIGURE 34.20 diagrams the phylogeny of amniotes, with some of the clades identified as boxed names on the branches. Note that the amniotes are a monophyletic group (clade), with all modern reptiles, birds, and mammals sharing a common ancestor.

Fig 34-20. A hypothetical phylogeny of amniotes. Extant groups are named at the top in boldface type.

An evolutionary radiation of amniotes during the early Mesozoic era gave rise to three main groups, called synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids--names based on key differences between the three groups in their skull anatomy. The synapsids included mammal-like reptiles called therapsids, from which mammals evolved. The anapsid lineage is probably totally extinct. Until recently, systematists considered turtles, based on skull anatomy, to be the only surviving anapsids. However, molecular comparisons place the turtles with the diapsids (the dotted branch in FIGURE 34.20 represents the still-uncertain ancestry of turtles). The diapsids include most or all (depending on the position of turtles) groups of modern reptiles, as well as a diversity of extinct swimming, flying, and land-based reptiles.

During the early Mesozoic radiation of amniotes, the diapsid lineage split into two evolutionary branches, the lepidosaurs (which include lizards, snakes, and two species of New Zealand animals called tuataras) and the archosaurs (which include crocodiles and alligators, dinosaurs, and birds). It's important to note the position of birds in the amniote phylogeny. Birds are diapsids, specifically members of the archosaur clade. Their closest extant relatives are the crocodiles and alligators, but they are even more closely related to a branch of the extinct reptiles known as dinosaurs. In fact, neither dinosaurs nor reptiles represent monophyletic taxa unless we also include birds.

FIGURE 34.21 compares the classical classification of the amniotes with three of several alternatives that are based on strict application of cladistic conventions, in which each taxon must represent a monophyletic group. The classical taxonomy (FIGURE 34.21a) divides the amniotes into three classes, Reptilia, Aves (birds), and Mammalia. It is a classification that highlights the distinctive adaptations that evolved in the avian (bird) lineage. However, another look at the cladogram in FIGURE 34.20 will reinforce the point made earlier that the traditional class Reptilia is paraphyletic because it does not include the birds. Researchers have proposed various cladistics-based alternatives for placing the birds in the taxonomy of amniotes. These options illustrate an enduring difference of taxonomic preference, between "lumpers," who prefer to minimize the number of taxa at each taxonomic level, and "splitters," who prefer a finer-grained taxonomy having more taxa at each level. In the most extreme lumpers' version of amniote classification, the bird problem is solved by simply including birds in the class Reptilia (FIGURE 34.21b). In one splitters' version, class Aves is preserved by also granting class status to other clades of reptiles (FIGURE 34.21c, which includes only extant groups). Another alternative identifies the two major diapsid branches as taxonomic classes, Lepidosauria and Archosauria (FIGURE 34.21d).

Fig 34-21. Taxonomic classes of amniotes. Many zoologists prefer the classical taxonomy, which is pragmatic, though it breaks from the strict cladistic requirement that named taxa must be monophyletic groups. The turtles are omitted from alternative (d) because their phylogeny is still uncertain.

Whichever classification your instructor prefers, "reptile" is still a useful informal category for discussing all the amniotes except the birds and mammals. We will also take the liberty of extending the "reptile" appellation to include the fossilized animals of the earliest amniote radiation, which branched from an amphibian ancestor. In other words, all modern amniotes, including mammals and birds, evolved from forms that most of us would probably call "reptiles" if we saw them walking around today.





 A reptilian heritage is evident in all amniotes

Reptilian Characteristics

Reptiles have several adaptations for terrestrial living not generally found in amphibians. Scales containing the protein keratin waterproof the skin of a reptile, helping prevent dehydration in dry air. Keratinized skin is the vertebrate analogue of the chitinized cuticle of insects and the waxy cuticle of land plants. Reptiles cannot breathe through their keratinized dry skin, and they obtain all their oxygen with lungs. Many turtles also use the moist surfaces of their cloaca for gas exchange.

Most reptiles lay shelled amniotic eggs on land (FIGURE 34.22). Fertilization in reptiles must occur internally, before the shell is secreted as the egg passes through the reproductive tract of the female. Some species of snakes and lizards are viviparous, their extraembryonic membranes forming a placenta that enables the embryo to obtain nutrients from its mother.

Fig 34-22. A hatching reptile. This Komodo dragon is breaking out of a parchmentlike shell, a common type of shell among reptiles. The shells of some reptiles are harder because of an abundance of calcium carbonate, as in bird eggs.

Reptiles are sometimes labeled "cold-blooded" animals because they do not use their metabolism extensively to control body temperature. But reptiles do regulate body temperature by using behavioral adaptations. For example, many lizards regulate their internal temperature by basking in the sun when the air is cool and seeking shade when the air is too warm. Because they absorb external heat rather than generating much of their own, reptiles are said to be ectotherms, a term more appropriate than cold-blooded. (The control of body temperature is discussed in more detail in Chapter 44.) By heating directly with solar energy rather than through the metabolic breakdown of food, a reptile can survive on less than 10%  of the calories required by a mammal of equivalent size.

The Origin and Evolutionary Radiation of Reptiles

Reptiles were far more widespread, numerous, and diverse during the Mesozoic era than they are today. The oldest reptilian fossils are found in rocks from Kansas, dating to the late Carboniferous period; they are about 300 million years old. Their ancestor was among the Devonian amphibians. In two great waves of adaptive radiation, reptiles became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates in a dynasty that lasted more than 200 million years.

The first major reptilian radiation occurred by the dawn of the Permian, the last period of the Paleozoic era, giving rise to the three main evolutionary branches introduced in FIGURE 34.20: Synapsida, Anapsida, and Diapsida.

The second great reptilian radiation was under way by late Triassic times (a little more than 200 million years ago) and was marked mainly by the origin and diversification of two groups of reptiles: the dinosaurs, which lived on land, and the pterosaurs, or flying reptiles. These groups were the dominant vertebrates on Earth for millions of years. Pterosaurs had wings formed from a membrane of skin stretched from the body wall, along the forelimb, to the tip of an elongated finger. Stiff fibers provided support for the skin of the wing. Dinosaurs, an extremely diverse group varying in body shape, size, and habitat, in cluded the largest animals ever to inhabit land. Fossils of gigantic dinosaurs that were 45 m long have recently been unearthed in New Mexico and Utah. And Paul Sereno, the paleontologist you met on pages 508-509, has led teams that have unearthed many newly described dinosaurs that lived on land masses now located in the Southern Hemisphere. There were two main dinosaur lineages: the ornithischians, mostly herbivores; and the saurischians, with both herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, including the ancestors of birds.

Contradicting the long-standing view that dinosaurs were slow, sluggish creatures, there is increasing evidence that many dinosaurs were agile, fast-moving, and, in some species, social. Paleontologists have also discovered signs of parental care among dinosaurs (FIGURE 34.23). There is continuing debate about whether dinosaurs were endothermic, capable of keeping the body warm through metabolism. Some anatomical evidence supports this hypothesis, but many experts are skeptical. The Mesozoic climate was relatively warm and consistent, and behavioral adaptations such as basking may have been sufficient for maintaining a suitable body temperature, especially for the land-dwelling dinosaurs. Also, large dinosaurs had low surface-to-volume ratios that reduced the effects of daily fluctuations in air temperature on the internal temperature of the animal. However, given the enormous diversity of dinosaurs, the clade could have included some endothermic species, especially among smaller forms inhabiting relatively cool climates. The dinosaur that gave rise to birds was certainly endothermic, as are all birds.

Fig 34-23. Dinosaur social behavior and parental care. This artist's re-creation of duck-billed dinosaurs is based on 80-million-year-old fossils discovered in Montana. Dinosaurs of this species were relatively large, about 7 m in length. They used their bills to browse on plants. Fossilized footprints indicate that duck-billed dinosaurs traveled in large social groups, or herds. Fossilized nests contain both eggs and offspring up to a few months old, evidence that these dinosaurs took care of their young. In fact, the genus name for this dinosaur, Maiasaura, means "good mother lizard."

At the end of the Cretaceous, the last period of the Mesozoic era, the dinosaurs became extinct. Some paleontologists argue that a few species survived into the early Cenozoic. The fossil record of terrestrial vertebrates in the Cretaceous is relatively poor, and it is uncertain whether the dinosaurs were undergoing a decline before they were finished off by the asteroid impact we discussed in Chapter 25. Either way, the greatest age of the reptiles had come to an end.

Modern Reptiles

There are about 6,500 species of extant reptiles. Taxonomists classify them into four groups: Testudines (turtles); Sphenodontia (tuataras); Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Crocodilia (alligators and crocodiles). In the traditional classification scheme of FIGURE 34.21a, these four taxa are orders within the class Reptilia; in the alternative classification of FIGURE 34.21c, the four taxa are elevated to the class level.

Turtles evolved during the Mesozoic era and have scarcely changed since (FIGURE 34.24a). The usually hard shell, an adaptation that protects against predators, has certainly contributed to this long success. Those turtles that returned to water during their evolution crawl ashore to lay their eggs.

Fig 34-24. Extant reptiles. (a) Turtles have changed little since their origin early in the Mesozoic era. This species is an eastern box turtle. (b) Lizards, such as this Australian frillneck, are the most numerous and diverse of the extant reptiles. A frillneck only spreads its frill when threatened, a response that probably discourages many predators. (c) Snakes may have evolved from lizards that adapted to a burrowing lifestyle. Note the loosely-hinged jaw of this western diamondback rattlesnake, photographed during an attempted strike. (d) Crocodiles and alligators are the reptiles most closely related to dinosaurs and birds. An American alligator is shown here.

Lizards are the most numerous and diverse reptiles alive today (FIGURE 34.24b). Most are relatively small; perhaps they were able to survive the Cretaceous "crunch" by nesting in crevices and decreasing their activity during cold periods, a practice many modern lizards use.

Snakes are probably descendants of lizards that adapted to a burrowing lifestyle. Today, most snakes live above the ground, but they have retained the limbless condition. Vestigial pelvic and limb bones in primitive snakes such as boas, however, are evidence that snakes evolved from reptiles with legs.

Snakes are carnivorous, and a number of adaptations aid them in hunting and eating prey. They have acute chemical sensors, and though they lack eardrums, snakes are sensitive to ground vibrations, which helps them detect the movements of prey. Heat-detecting organs between the eyes and nostrils of pit vipers, including rattlesnakes, are sensitive to minute temperature changes, enabling these night hunters to locate warm animals. Poisonous snakes inject their toxin through a pair of sharp hollow or grooved teeth. The flicking tongue is not poisonous but helps fan odors toward olfactory organs on the roof of the mouth. Loosely articulated jaws enable most snakes to swallow prey larger than the diameter of the snake itself (FIGURE 34.24c).

Crocodiles and alligators (crocodilians) are among the largest living reptiles (some turtles are heavier) (FIGURE 34.24d). They spend most of their time in water, breathing air through their upturned nostrils. Crocodilians are confined to the warm regions of Africa, China, Indonesia, India, Australia, South America, and the southeastern United States, where alligators have made a strong comeback after spending years on the endangered species list. Among the modern animals traditionally classified as reptiles, crocodilians are the most closely related to the dinosaurs (see FIGURE 34.20). However, as we pointed out earlier, the modern animals that seem to share the most recent ancestor with the dinosaurs are the birds.





 Birds began as feathered reptiles

Birds evolved during the great reptilian radiation of the Mesozoic era (see FIGURE 34.20). Amniotic eggs and scales on the legs are just two of the reptilian features we see in birds. But modern birds look quite different from modern reptiles because of their feathers and other distinctive flight equipment.

Characteristics of Birds

Almost every part of a typical bird's anatomy is modified in some way that enhances flight. The bones have an internal structure that is honeycombed, making them strong but light (FIGURE 34.25). The skeleton of a frigate bird, for instance, has a wingspan of more than 2 m but weighs only about 113 g (4 oz). Another adaptation reducing the weight of birds is the absence of some organs. Females, for instance, have only one ovary. Also, modern birds are toothless, an adaptation that trims the weight of the head. Food is not chewed in the mouth but ground in the gizzard, a digestive organ near the stomach. (Crocodiles also have gizzards, as did some dinosaurs.) The bird's beak, made of keratin, has proven to be very adaptable during avian evolution, taking on a great variety of shapes suitable for different diets.

Fig 34-25. Form fits function: the avian wing and feather. (a) A wing is supported by a remodeled version of the tetrapod forelimb. (b) The honeycombed anatomy of the bones is a flight adaptation that reduces weight. (c) A feather consists of a central hollow shaft, from which radiate the vanes. The vanes are made up of barbs, in turn bearing even smaller branches called barbules. Birds have contour feathers and downy feathers. Contour feathers are the stiff ones that contribute to the aerodynamic shapes of the wings and body. Their barbules have hooks that cling to barbules on neighboring barbs. When a bird preens, it runs the length of a feather through its bill, engaging the hooks and uniting the barbs into a precisely shaped vane. Downy feathers lack hooks, and the free-form arrangement of barbs produces a fluffiness that provides excellent insulation because of the trapped air.

Flying requires a great expenditure of energy from an active metabolism. Birds are endothermic; they use their own metabolic heat to maintain a warm, constant body temperature. Feathers and in some species a layer of fat provide insulation that enables birds to retain their metabolically generated heat. An efficient respiratory system and a circulatory system with a four-chambered heart keep tissues well supplied with oxygen and nutrients, supporting a high rate of metabolism. The lungs have tiny tubes leading to and from elastic air sacs that help dissipate heat and reduce the density of the body.

For safe flight, senses, especially vision, must be acute. Birds have excellent eyes, perhaps the best of all the vertebrates. The visual areas of the brain are well developed, as are the motor areas; flight also requires excellent coordination.

With brains proportionately larger than those of reptiles and amphibians, birds generally display very complex behavior. Avian behavior is particularly intricate during breeding season, when birds engage in elaborate rituals of courtship. Because eggs are shelled when laid, fertilization must be internal. Copulation involves contact between the mates' vents, the openings to their cloacas. After eggs are laid, the avian embryo must be kept warm through brooding by the mother, father, or both, depending on the species.

A bird's most obvious adaptation for flight is its wings. Bird wings are airfoils that illustrate the same principles of aerodynamics as the wings of an airplane (FIGURE 34.26). Providing power for flight, birds flap their wings by contractions of large pectoral (breast) muscles anchored to a keel on the sternum (breastbone). Some birds, such as eagles and hawks, have wings adapted for soaring on air currents and flap their wings only occasionally; other birds, including hummingbirds, must flap continuously to stay aloft. In either case, it is the shape and arrangement of the feathers that form the wing into an airfoil. The fastest birds are the appropriately named swifts, which can fly 170 km/hr.

Fig 34-26. A bald eagle in flight. Bird wings are airfoils, structures whose shape creates lift by altering air currents. The leading edge of an airfoil is thicker than the trailing edge, its upper surface is somewhat convex, and its under surface is flattened or concave. This shape makes the air passing over the wing travel farther than the air passing under the wing. As a result, air molecules are spaced farther apart (expanded) above the wing than below it. Thus, the air pressure pushing downward on the wing is less than the pressure pushing upward on the wing's bottom surface. This pressure differential provides the "lift" for flight.

In being both extremely light and strong, feathers are among the most remarkable of vertebrate adaptations. Feathers are made of keratin, the same protein that forms our hair and fingernails and the scales of reptiles. Feathers may have functioned first as insulation during the evolution of endothermy, only later being co-opted as flight equipment.

The evolution of flight required radical alteration in body form, but flight provides many benefits. It enhances hunting and scavenging; many birds exploit flying insects, an abundant, highly nutritious food resource. Flight also provides ready escape from earthbound predators and enables some birds to migrate great distances to utilize different food resources and seasonal breeding areas. The bird that travels farthest in its annual migration is the arctic tern, which flies round-trip between the North Pole and South Pole each year.

The Origin of Birds

Cladistic analyses of fossilized skeletons support the hypothesis that the closest reptilian relatives of birds were the theropods, a group of relatively small, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs. (The velociraptors of Jurassic Park fame were theropods.) Most researchers agree that the ancestor of birds was a feathered theropod. However, some scientists place the origin of birds much earlier, from an ancestor common to both birds and dinosaurs.

The most famous Mesozoic bird is Archaeopteryx, known from fossils discovered in Bavarian limestone in Germany. This ancient bird lived about 150 million years ago, during the late Jurassic period. Unlike modern birds, but similar to reptiles, Archaeopteryx had clawed forelimbs, teeth, and a long tail containing vertebrae (FIGURE 34.27). Thus, Archaeopteryx was even more anatomically similar to dinosaurs than are modern birds. In fact, if it were not for the preservation of its feathers, Archaeopteryx would probably be classified as a theropod dinosaur. The skeletal anatomy of Archaeopteryx indicates that it was a weak flyer, perhaps mainly a tree-dwelling glider. A combination of gliding downward and jumping into the air from the ground may have been the precursor of actual flight in the evolution of birds. However, Archaeopteryx is not considered to be the ancestor of modern birds but probably represents an extinct side branch of avian evolution. Nonetheless, the evolutionary branch that included Archaeopteryx probably stemmed from an ancestor that also gave rise to the lineage from which modern birds evolved.

In 1998, paleontologists described a diversity of fossils in Chinese sediments that may help fill in the gap between dinosaurs and early birds such as Archaeopteryx. The Chinese fossils are feathered but flightless dinosaurs (FIGURE 34.28). Such anatomy is consistent with a hypothesis that feathers evolved as adaptations with functions other than flight, such as thermoregulation or courtship displays for mating. However, the Chinese fossils are about 20 million years younger than Archaeopteryx. Do the Chinese fossils represent descendants of feathered, flightless dinosaurs that survived for tens of millions of years, even as Archaeopteryx and other birds also evolved from those flightless ancestors? This hypothesis makes the prediction that paleontologists may one day unearth flightless dinosaurs with feathers that predate Archaeopteryx. Or did these flightless, feathered animals evolve secondarily from early flying birds, analogous to the abandonment of flight in such modern birds as ostriches? Certain skeletal features support this second hypothesis.

The Chinese sediments also include younger fossils with wings, such as an abundant Cretaceous bird named Confuciusornis. It had many features suggesting a closer kinship to modern birds than can be claimed for Archaeopteryx. For example, the weight-trimming adaptations of Confuciusornis included the absence of teeth, the replacement of certain skull elements by a horny bill, and a tail reduced to a short stub.

The intense current interest in the origin of birds will undoubtedly bring us closer to understanding how these masters of the sky evolved from nonflying reptiles.

Modern Birds

There are about 8,600 extant species of birds classified in about 28 orders. Flight is typical of birds, but there are several flightless species, including the ostrich, kiwi, and emu (FIGURE 34.29a). Flightless birds are collectively called ratites (Latin, "flat-bottomed") because their breastbone lacks a keel and the large breast muscles that attach to it in flying birds.

In common with many species, the harlequin duck, which inhabits mountain streams and coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest, exhibits pronounced color differences between the sexes.(c) Laysan albatrosses. Most birds, as exhibited here by a pair of Laysan albatrosses, have specific courtship and mating behavior. (d) Barn swallow. The barn swallow is a member of the order Passeriformes. Passeriformes are called perching birds because the toes of their feet can lock around a tree branch, enabling the bird to rest in place for long periods of time.

In contrast to ratites, other birds are called carinates because they have a carina, or sternal keel, supporting their large breast muscles. These muscles provide flight power in flying birds. The demands of flight have rendered the general body form of carinate birds similar to one another, yet experienced bird watchers can distinguish many species by their body profile. Carinate birds also exhibit great variety in feather colors, beak and foot shape, behavior, and flying style (FIGURE 34.29b-d). Among the most unusual carinate birds are the penguins, which do not fly, but use their powerful breast muscles in swimming. Nearly 60%  of the living bird species belong in one carinate order called the passeriformes, or perching birds. These are the familiar jays, swallows, sparrows, warblers, and many others (FIGURE 34.29d).





 Mammals diversified extensively in the wake of the Cretaceous extinctions

With the extinction of the dinosaurs and the fragmentation of continents that occurred at the close of the Mesozoic era, mammals underwent an extensive adaptive radiation. There are about 4,500 species of mammals on Earth today. As mammals ourselves, we naturally have a special interest in this class of vertebrates. Let's examine some of the features we share with all other mammals.

Mammalian Characteristics

Vertebrates of the class Mammalia were first defined by Linnaeus by their possession of mammary glands. Mammary glands, which produce milk, are a distinctively mammalian characteristic: All mammalian mothers nourish their babies with milk, a balanced diet rich in fats, sugars, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Hair is another mammalian characteristic. Like the feathers of birds, hair is made of keratin, although zoologists are uncertain about its evolutionary origin. Mammals are endothermic and most mammals have an active metabolism. Efficient respiratory and circulatory systems (including a four-chambered heart) support a high metabolic rate. A sheet of muscle called the diaphragm helps ventilate the lungs. Hair and a layer of fat under the skin help the body retain metabolic heat.

Most mammals are born rather than hatched. Fertilization is internal, and the embryo develops inside the uterus of the female's reproductive tract. In eutherian (placental) mammals and marsupials, the lining of the mother's uterus and extraembryonic membranes arising from the embryo collectively form a placenta, where nutrients diffuse into the embryo's blood. Eutherians are commonly called placental mammals because, compared to marsupials, their placentas are more complex and provide a more intimate and long-lasting association between the mother and her developing young.

Mammals generally have larger brains than other vertebrates of equivalent size, and many species are capable learners. The relatively long duration of parental care extends the time for offspring to learn important survival skills by observing their parents.

Differentiation of teeth is another important mammalian trait. Whereas the teeth of reptiles are generally conical and uniform in size, the teeth of mammals come in a variety of sizes and shapes adapted for chewing many kinds of foods. Our own dentition, for example, includes teeth modified for shearing (incisors and canine teeth) and for crushing and grinding (premolars and molars). Another part of the feeding apparatus, the jaw, was also remodeled during the evolution of mammals from reptiles, and two of the bones formerly making up the jaw joint were incorporated into the mammalian inner ear (FIGURE 34.30).

Fig 34-30. The evolution of the mammalian jaw and ear bones. The reptile Dimetrodon (left) was an early synapsid, the lineage that eventually gave rise to the mammals. Morganucodon (right) was one of the first mammals. (a) Notice that the lower jaw of the reptile is composed of several fused bones. In the reptile, two small bones, the quadrate and articular, form part of the jaw joint. (b) The mammalian lower jaw is reduced to a single bone, the dentary, and the location of the jaw joint has shifted. The single-bone lower jaw of mammals is stronger than the multibone jaw of reptiles. (c)-(d) During the evolutionary remodeling of the mammalian skull, the quadrate and articular bones became incorporated into the middle ear as two of the three bones that transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The steps in this evolutionary remodeling are evident in a succession of fossils of mammal-like reptiles.

The Evolution of Mammals

Mammals evolved from reptilian stock even earlier than birds. The oldest fossils believed to be mammalian date back 220 million years, into the Triassic period. The ancestor of mammals was among the therapsids, part of the synapsid branch of reptilian phylogeny (see FIGURE 34.20). An extensive record of fossils from the Permian and Triassic connects mammals with their reptilian ancestors. These fossils show that the distinctively mammalian structure of the legs, skull, jaws, and teeth evolved in many small stages. The therapsids disappeared during the reign of the dinosaurs, but their mammalian descendants coexisted with the dinosaurs throughout the Mesozoic era. Most Mesozoic mammals were very small--about the size of shrews--and most probably ate insects. A variety of evidence, such as the size of the eye sockets, suggests that these tiny mammals were nocturnal.

As the Cenozoic era dawned in the wake of the Cretaceous extinctions, mammals were in the midst of a great adaptive radiation (though the major lineages may have originated earlier--see FIGURE 25.19). That diversity is represented today in the three major groups: monotremes (egg-laying mammals), marsupials (mammals with pouches), and eutherian (placental) mammals.

Monotremes

Monotremes--the platypuses and the echidnas (spiny anteaters)--are the only living mammals that lay eggs (FIGURE 34.31a). The egg, which is reptilian in structure and development, contains enough yolk to nourish the developing embryo. Monotremes have hair and produce milk, two of the most important trademarks of Mammalia. On the belly of a monotreme mother are specialized glands that secrete milk. After hatching, the baby sucks the milk from the fur of the mother, who has no nipples. The mixture of ancestral reptilian characters and derived characters of mammals suggests that monotremes descended from a very early branch in the mammalian genealogy. Today, monotremes are found only in Australia and New Guinea.

(b) A young marsupial. The young of marsupials, such as this Australian brushtail possum, are born very early in their develop ment. They finish their growth while nursing from a nipple (in their mother's pouch in most species).(c) Long-nosed bandicoot, a marsupial. Bandicoots have a pouch that opens to the rear, whereas in other marsupials, such as the kangaroos, it opens to the front. Most bandicoots are diggers and burrowers that eat mainly insects but also some small vertebrates and plant material. Their rear-opening pouch helps protect the young from dirt as the mother digs.

Marsupials

Opossums, kangaroos, bandicoots, and koalas are examples of marsupial mammals. A marsupial is born very early in its development and completes its embryonic development while nursing (FIGURE 34.31b). In most species, the nursing young are held within a maternal pouch called a marsupium. A red kangaroo, for instance, is about the size of a honeybee at its birth, just 33 days after fertilization. Its hind legs are merely buds, but the forelimbs are strong enough for the offspring to crawl from the exit of the reproductive tract to the mother's pouch, a journey lasting a few minutes.

In Australia, marsupials have radiated and filled niches occupied by eutherian (placental) mammals in other parts of the world. Convergent evolution has resulted in a diversity of marsupials that resemble their eutherian counterparts occupying similar ecological roles (FIGURE 34.32, p. 704).

Fig 34-32. Evolutionary convergence of marsupial and eutherian (placental) mammals. Adaptive radiation in Australia has fit marsupials to many of the ecological roles filled by eutherian mammals on other continents. Convergent evolution has produced a number of remarkable look-alikes. (Drawings are not to scale.)

The opossums of North and South America are the most diverse of only three families of extant marsupials outside the Australian region, though South America had a diverse marsupial fauna throughout the Tertiary period. After the breakup of Pangaea, South America and Australia became island continents, and their marsupials diversified in isolation from the placental mammals that began an adaptive radiation on the northern continents. Australia has not been in contact with another continent since early in the Cenozoic era, about 65 million years ago. The South American fauna, meanwhile, has not remained cloistered. Placental mammals reached South America throughout the Cenozoic. The most important migrations occurred about 12 million years ago and then again about 3 million years ago, when North and South America joined at the Panamanian isthmus. Extensive two-way traffic of animals took place over the land bridge. The biogeography of mammals is another example of the interplay between biological and geologic evolution.

Eutherian (Placental) Mammals

Compared to marsupials, eutherian mammals (placentals) have a longer period of pregnancy. Young eutherians complete their embryonic development within the uterus, joined to the mother by the placenta.

Adaptive radiation during the Cretaceous and early Tertiary periods produced the orders of eutherian mammals we recognize today (Table 34.1). Marsupials and eutherians are more closely related to each other than either is to monotremes. Fossil evidence indicates that marsupials and eutherians may have diverged from a common ancestor about 80 to 100 million years ago, but the molecular clock suggests an older date, at least 125 million years ago. The common ancestor of monotremes and the other two groups may have lived more like 200 million years ago.

Table 34-1. Major Orders of Mammals (Orders are color-coded according to the clades in FIGURE 34.33)

Order ExamplesMain CharacteristicsMonotremata Platypuses, echidnasLay eggs; have no nipples; suck milk from fur of mother

Chiroptera BatsAdapted for flying; possess a broad skinfold that extends from elongated fingers to body and legs



Insectivora"Core insectivores": some moles, some shrewsInsect-eating mammals



Molecular systematics has helped to clarify the evolutionary relationships among the orders of eutherian mammals, though there is still no broad consensus on a phylogenetic tree. The main current hypothesis clusters the eutherian orders into four main clades (FIGURE 34.33).

Fig 34-33. Hypothetical cladogram of mammals.

One branch includes the elephants, together with several less well-known African mammals, such as the aardvarks and hyraxes, as well as manatees. This eutherian clade is referred to as the Afrotheria.

A second branch underwent a radiation in South America, and consists of the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos--the order Edentata in TABLE 34.1.

A third clade includes the bats (Chiroptera), certain insectivorous mammals (the "core insectivores," such as some of the animals that have the common names shrews and moles), carnivores, two ungulate (hoofed) orders--artiodactyls (pigs, cows, camels, and hippos) and perissodactyls (horses and rhinoceroses)--together with the cetaceans (dolphins and whales). One of the most striking results of recent phylogenetic research on mammals is that the cetaceans probably form a branch within the artiodactyls. Thus, hippos are more closely related to whales and dolphins than they are to other artiodactyls, such as sheep and camels. In late 2001, in fact, researchers reported an Eocene whale fossil (Rodhocetus) in Pakistan that has a foot skeleton very similar to the foot anatomy of hippos and pigs. The hypothetical mammalian phylogeny based on molecular systematics predicts that whales with hoof-like swimming appendages once lived, and now the fossil record has corroborated the molecular evidence. The traditional order Artiodactyla is therefore not monophyletic, and researchers suggest that the cetaceans and artiodactyls should be combined in the order Cetartiodactyla (see TABLE 34.1). The order Carnivora includes cats, dogs, raccoons, skunks, and the pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses). Seals and their relatives apparently evolved from middle Cenozoic carnivorans that became adapted for swimming.

The fourth eutherian branch is by far the largest in terms of numbers of modern species. It contains the lagomorphs (rabbits and relatives) and rodents, together with the primates. Order Rodentia includes rats, mice, squirrels, and beavers. With about 1,770 species, this is by far the largest order of mammals. The name Rodentia, from the Latin word for "gnawing," refers to one of the distinctive features of the group: Both the upper jaw and the lower jaw have a pair of large front teeth (incisors) that resist heavy wear by growing continually. Order Primates, which we discuss next, includes monkeys, apes, and humans.





 Primate evolution provides a context for understanding human origins

We have tracked vertebrate evolution through the mammalian orders and can now begin to trace our own specific ancestry. Order Primates includes Homo sapiens and its closest kin. We are primates.

Some General Primate Characteristics

Primates are difficult to define unambiguously in terms of morphological attributes, but most primates have hands and feet adapted for grasping, and, relative to other mammals, they have large brains and short jaws, giving them a flat face. Primates have forward-looking eyes, close together on the front of the face. They also have flat nails on their digits rather than the narrow claws of other mammals. There are other changes in the hands and feet, such as the evolution of the skin ridges on fingers (these account for our fingerprints). Primates, perhaps related to their large brains, also have relatively well-developed parental care and relatively complex social behavior.

The earliest primates were probably tree dwellers, shaped through natural selection to the demands of living in the trees. For example, the grasping hands and feet of primates are adaptations for hanging on to tree branches. All modern primates, except Homo, have a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes, enabling them to grasp onto branches with their feet. A similar separation of the thumb from the other fingers evolved in the hands of primates. Humans have a fully opposable thumb; that is, we can touch the ventral surface (fingerprint side) of the tip of all four fingers with the ventral surface of the thumb of the same hand. The thumb is relatively mobile and separate from the fingers in all primates, but a fully opposable thumb is found only in anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and humans). The opposable thumb, like the grasping foot, evolved first for gripping branches. In monkeys and apes, the opposable thumb functions in a grasping "power grip," but in humans, the opposable thumb has adaptations that enable more precise manipulation; we have a distinctive bone structure at the base of our thumbs associated with our "precision grip." The unique dexterity of humans represents descent with modification from ancestral hands adapted for life in the trees. Some of the other primate features also originated as adaptations for tree dwelling. For instance, the overlapping fields of vision of the two eyes enhance depth perception, an obvious advantage when brachiating (swinging). Excellent eye-hand coordination is also important for arboreal maneuvering. Humans, of course, do not live in trees, but we retain in modified form many of the traits that originally evolved there.

Modern Primates

The two subgroups of the Primates are the Prosimii and Anthropoidea. The prosimians ("premonkeys") probably resemble early arboreal primates (FIGURE 34.34). The lemurs of Madagascar and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers that live in tropical Africa and southern Asia are examples of prosimians. The anthropoids include monkeys, apes, and humans. The oldest known anthropoid fossils, discovered in China in mid-Eocene strata about 45 million years old, support the hypothesis that tarsiers are the prosimians most closely related to anthropoids (FIGURE 34.35, p. 708).

Fig 34-35. A phylogenetic tree of primates. The fossil record indicates that the prosimian and anthropoid lineages were diverging by about 50 million years ago. Among the anthropoids, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and the apes (represented today by several species of gibbons, the orangutan, the gorilla, and chimpanzees) have been evolving on separate lineages for over 40 million years. Molecular evidence shows that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than are any other apes. The time of divergence of the hominid lineage (human branch of the evolutionary tree) is somewhere between 5 and 7 million years ago.

The fossil record indicates that by 40 million years ago, monkeys were established both in the Old World (in Africa and Asia) and in the New World (in South America). By that time, South America and Africa had drifted apart. The first monkeys probably evolved in the Old World, and may have reached South America by rafting on logs or other debris from Africa. What is certain is that New World monkeys and Old World monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations during their many millions of years of separation (FIGURE 34.36). All New World monkeys are arboreal, whereas Old World monkeys include ground-dwelling as well as arboreal species. Most monkeys of both groups are diurnal (active during the day) and usually live in bands held together by social behavior.

Fig 34-36. New World monkeys and Old World monkeys compared. (a) New World monkeys, such as spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and capuchins, have prehensile tails and nostrils that open to the sides. (b) Old World monkeys lack prehensile tails, and their nostrils open down-ward. The tough seat pad is unique to the Old World group, which includes macaques, mandrills, baboons, and rhesus monkeys.

In addition to monkeys, the anthropoid suborder also includes the four genera of apes, shown in FIGURE 34.37: Hylobates (gibbons), Pongo (orangutans), Gorilla (gorillas), and Pan (chimpanzees and bonobos). Modern apes are confined exclusively to tropical regions of the Old World; the ancestors of the apes evolved from Old World monkeys about 25-30 million years ago. With the exception of gibbons, modern apes are larger than monkeys, with relatively long arms and short legs and no tails. Although all the apes are capable of brachiation (traveling by swinging from branch to branch in trees), only gibbons and orangutans are primarily arboreal. Social organization varies among the genera of apes; gorillas and chimpanzees are highly social. Apes have larger brains proportionate to body size than monkeys, and their behavior is more flexible.

These Asian primates are also the only monogamous apes. (b) The orangutan is a shy and solitary ape that lives in the rain forests of Sumatra and Borneo. Orangutans spend most of their time in trees, but they do venture onto the forest floor occasionally. Note the foot adapted for grasping and the opposable thumb. (c) Gorillas are the largest apes, with some males almost 2 m tall and weighing about 200 kg. These herbivores are confined to Africa, where they usually live in small groups of about 10 to 20 individuals. (d) Chimpanzees live in tropical Africa. They feed and sleep in trees but also spend a great deal of time on the ground. Chimpanzees are intelligent, communicative, and social. (e) Bonobos, smaller than chimpanzees, survive today only in the African nation of Congo.





 Humanity is one very young twig on the vertebrate tree

In the continuum of life spanning over 3.5 billion years, humans and apes have shared ancestry for all but the last few million years. Paleoanthropology, the study of human origins and evolution, focuses on this tiny fraction of geologic time during which humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor.

Paleoanthropologists use two words that are easy to confuse. Hominoid is a broader term, referring to great apes and humans. (Note that "anthropoid" is an even broader term, since it includes monkeys.) If a fossil is called "hominoid," it is related to us but may be more closely related to chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. Hominid is a word with narrower meaning, referring to the twigs of the evolutionary tree that are more closely related to us than to any other living species. If a fossil is called a "hominid," this implies the hypothesis that the species is closer to us than it is to a chimpanzee or a gorilla. There are two main groups of hominids: the australopithecines, which came first and are all extinct, and members of the genus Homo, with all species extinct except one: Homo sapiens.

Some Common Misconceptions

Paleoanthropology has a checkered history. Until about 25 years ago, researchers often gave new names to fossil forms that were undoubtedly the same species as fossils found by competing scientists. Elaborate theories have often been based on a few teeth or a fragment of jawbone. Many misconceptions about human evolution generated during the early part of the twentieth century still persist in the minds of much of the general population, long after these myths have been debunked by fossil discoveries.

Let's first dispose of the myth that our ancestors were chimpanzees or any other modern apes. Chimpanzees and humans represent two divergent branches of the hominoid tree that evolved from a common ancestor that was neither a chimpanzee nor a human.

Another misconception envisions human evolution as a ladder with a series of steps leading directly from an ancestral hominoid to Homo sapiens. This is often illustrated as a parade of fossil hominids becoming progressively more modern as they march across the page. If human evolution is a parade, then it is a disorderly one, with many splinter groups having traveled down dead ends. At times in hominid history, several different human species coexisted (FIGURE 34.38). Human phylogeny is more like a multibranched bush than a ladder, our species being the tip of the only twig that still lives.

Fig 34-38. A timeline for some hominid species. Most of these fossils come from sites in eastern and southern Africa. Note that at most times in human history, two or more hominid species were contemporaries. The names of some of the species are controversial, reflecting phylogenetic debates about what skeletal details and biogeography imply about relationships among the hominids. For example, this diagram represents the prehistoric hominids known as Neanderthals as a species separate from Homo sapiens, but some paleoanthropologists consider Neanderthals to be a subspecies of H. sapiens.

One more myth we must bury is the notion that various human characteristics, such as upright posture and an enlarged brain, evolved in unison. A popular image is of early humans as half-stooped, half-witted cave dwellers. Different features evolved at different rates--a phenomenon known as mosaic evolution--with erect posture, or bipedalism, leading the way. Our pedigree includes ancestors who walked upright but had brains much less developed than ours.

After dismissing some of the folklore on human evolution, however, we must admit that many questions about our ancestry remain.

Early Anthropoids: A Change of Environment

Our anthropoid ancestors of 30-35 million years ago were still tree dwellers. But then about 20 million years ago, the Indian plate collided with Asia and thrust up the Himalayan range. The climate became drier and the forests of what is now Africa and Asia contracted. The result was an increased area of savanna (grassland) habitat, with fewer trees. Some of the major evolutionary changes leading to the origin of our species may have occurred as our ancestors came to live less in the trees. There was then an evolutionary modification of arboreal adaptations to a new way of life, walking on the ground in more open habitats. Based on the fossil record and comparisons of DNA between humans and chimpanzees, most researchers now agree that humans and apes diverged from a common hominoid ancestor only about 5-7 million years ago.

Some Major Features of Human Evolution

Brain Size.Based on skull measurements, researchers have determined that hominoids of about 6 million years ago had brains with volumes of about 400-450 cm3. That's close to the brain volume of modern chimpanzees. In contrast, modern humans have brains averaging about 1,300 cm3 in size. This tripling of brain volume is associated with such cultural trends as the development of complex language.

Jaw Shape.Our hominoid ancestors had longer jaws--what anthropologists call prognathic jaws--than the jaws of modern humans. Chimpanzees retain this skeletal feature of prognathic jaws. During human evolution, shortening of the jaws resulted in flatter faces with more pronounced chins (compare your own face to that of the chimpanzee in FIGURE 34.37d). Along with this anatomical remodeling of the jaw, there were also changes in dentition (teeth).

Bipedal Posture.Based on the skeletal anatomy of fossils, it is clear that our hominoid ancestors walked on all four limbs when they were on the ground, as all modern apes do. The evolution of bipedal posture--upright posture and two-legged walking--is associated with key skeletal modifications that are evident in early hominid fossils.

Reduced Size Difference Between the Sexes.In hominoids, a size difference between males and females is a major feature of sexual dimorphism (see Chapter 23). On average, male gorillas and orangutans weigh about twice as much as females of their species. In chimpanzees and bonobos, the size difference is much less, with males about 1.35 times heavier than females, on average. This sexual dimorphism in size is even more reduced in humans, with males averaging about 1.2 times the weight of females.

Some Key Changes in Family Structure.The study of fossils can document evolutionary changes in skull capacity, jaw shape, bipedal posture, and, when a population has left enough fossils, even in male-female size differences. But to identify evolutionary changes in social behavior, such as family structure, researchers rely more on comparisons between humans and other extant hominoids. In contrast to the social organization of most ape species (as well as most monkeys), monogamy, with long-term pair-bonding between mates, prevails in most human cultures. Newborn human infants are exceptionally dependent on their mothers, and the duration of parental care for offspring is much longer in humans than in other hominoids (apes). This extended parental care, coupled with the large brain size, enhances learning and is associated with the behavioral complexity of humans.

Australopithecines: Early Hominids and the Origin of Bipedal Posture

Let us now see what the fossil record tells us about the evolution of such human features as shortened jaws, increased brain size, bipedal posture, and reduced size difference between males and females. All known hominid (human) fossils older than about 1.5 million years are from eastern and southern Africa. Most of these fossils are teeth and fragments of jaws, skulls, and other skeletal pieces, although paleontologists have also unearthed some spectacular skeletons that are much more complete, especially for relatively recent hominids. Researchers must try to reconstruct human phylogeny from this incomplete record, revising their hypotheses to account for new fossil evidence, as well as data from new research strategies such as molecular systematics. We will focus here mainly on the hominids known as the australopithecines, the various pre-Homo species classified in the genus Australopithecus (see FIGURE 34.38).

In 1924, British anthropologist Raymond Dart announced that a fossilized skull discovered in a South African quarry was the remains of an early human. He named his "ape-man"Australopithecus africanus ("southern ape of Africa"). With the discovery of more fossils, it became clear that A. africanus was in fact a hominid that walked fully erect (was bipedal) and had humanlike hands and teeth. However, the brain of A. africanus was only about one-third the size of a modern human's brain. Various species of Australopithecus existed for about 3 million years, beginning nearly 4 million years ago (see FIGURE 34.38).

In 1974, in the Afar region of Ethiopia, paleoanthropologists discovered an Australopithecus skeleton that was 40%  complete. "Lucy," as the fossil was named, was petite--only about 1 m tall. The skeleton is 3.24 million years old. Lucy and similar fossils have been considered sufficiently different from Australopithecus africanus to be named a separate species, Australopithecus afarensis (for the Afar region). Lucy's head was the size of a softball, indicating a brain size about the same as that of a chimpanzee of Lucy's body size. A. afarensis skulls are also apelike in being prognathic. And sexual dimorphism in size was more apelike than human, with males about 1.5 times the size of females. However, the fragments of the pelvis and skull bones indicate that A. afarensis walked on two legs (FIGURE 34.39a). Fossils discovered in the early 1990s extend the longevity of A. afarensis as a species to a span of at least one million years.

Fig 34-39. Upright posture predates an enlarged brain in human evolution. (a) Lucy, a 3.24-million-year-old skeleton, represents the hominid species Australopithecus afarensis. Fragments of the pelvis and skull show that A. afarensis was bipedal, though the arms indicate that Lucy was also adapted for arboreal locomotion. (b) The Laetoli footprints, over 3.5 million years old, confirm that upright posture evolved quite early in hominid history.

At the risk of oversimplifying, one could say that A. afarensis was more apelike than human above the neck, but more humanlike below. Fossilized footprints in Laetoli, Tanzania, corroborate the skeletal evidence that homonids living at the time of A. afarensis were bipedal (FIGURE 34.39b). However, the skeletons also suggest a capacity for arboreal locomotion, with arms relatively long in proportion to body size compared to the proportions for modern humans. A. afarensis may have been able to move well both in the trees and on the ground, suggesting a mixed forest-savanna habitat.

In the past few years, paleoanthropologists have found hominid species that predate A. afarensis. The oldest fossil that is unambiguously human--that is, definitely more closely related to humans than to apes based on skeletal analysis--is Australopithecus anamensis, which lived just over 4 million years ago. And note in FIGURE 34.38 that there are even older fossils of putative hominids going back 6 million years. Thus, the australopithecine fossils indicate that hominids were bipedal at least 4 million years ago, and perhaps hundreds of thousands of years earlier. The fossil record of humanity is creeping closer to the ape-human split that molecular systematists estimate occurred about 5-7 million years ago.

One of the key questions in paleoanthropology is which of the australopithecines were evolutionary dead ends and which were either on, or close to, the phylogenetic lineage that eventually sprouted the Homo branch. For the million years that A. afarensis is represented in the fossil record, it changed little. Then, beginning about 3 million years ago, what was apparently an adaptive radiation produced several new hominid species, including A. africanus, the human first discovered by Dart 80 years ago. Either A. africanus or some closely related species was probably ancestral to two hominid branches known from later fossils. One lineage consisted of the "robust" australopithecines. They had sturdy skulls with powerful jaws and large teeth, adapted for grinding and chewing hard, tough foods. These robust forms contrast with other australopithecines, including the earlier A. afarensis and A. africanus, which were what anthropologists call "gracile" (slender) australopithecines. The gracile forms had lighter feeding equipment adapted for softer foods. Most researchers agree that the robust australopithecines were an evolutionary dead end, and that the ancestors of Homo were among the gracile australopithecines.

Homo: The Evolution of Larger Brains and the Global Dispersion of Humans

The earliest fossils that anthropologists place in our genus, Homo, are classified as Homo habilis. These fossils, ranging in age from about 2.5 to 1.6 million years old, show clear signs of some modern hominid characters above the neck. Compared to the australopithecines, H. habilis had less prognathic jaws and larger brains, about 600-750 cm3 compared to the average of 500 cm3 for Australopithecus africanus. In some cases, anthropologists have found sharp stone tools with fossils of Homo habilis, which means "handy man." After walking upright for at least 2 million years, some hominids had started to use their brains and hands to fashion tools.

A remarkably complete fossil of a young hominid known as "Turkana Boy" indicates that even larger brains had evolved by 1.6 million years ago (FIGURE 34.40). The boy had a brain that would probably be over 900 cm3 in an adult of his species. This brain size is between that of H. habilis and another species, Homo erectus. It is a reasonable hypothesis that Turkana Boy represents hominid forms linking H. habilis to H. erectus in our phylogeny.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 34-40. The Turkana boy. This 1.7 million-year-old fossil is anatomically intermediate between H. habilis and H. erectus. Some anthropologists classify the specimen as H. erectus, while others assign it to a separate species (H. ergaster), hypothetically ancestral to both H. erectus and H. sapiens.

Homo erectus was the first hominid species to migrate out of Africa. These humans colonized Asia, including the Indonesian archipelago, leaving fossils known by such names as "Beijing Man" and "Java Man."H. erectus lived from about 1.8 million years ago to 500,000 years ago, and had already populated Asia by at least 1.5 million years ago. Compared to H. habilis, H. erectus was taller and had a larger brain, averaging about 1,100 cm3. And H. erectus males were only about 1.2 times the size of females in the same population, a sexual dimorphism in size matching that of modern humans. Some anthropologists interpret this to mean that monogamy based on pair-bonding had evolved in H. erectus societies, replacing a more polygamous system where the largest, strongest males generally outcompeted smaller males and left the most offspring.

In addition to dispersing from Africa to Asia, H. erectus also spread into Europe, though the timing of that migration is less certain than for Asia. In Europe, H. erectus gave rise to the humans known as Neanderthals.

Neanderthals are named for the locale where their fossils were first discovered, the Neander Valley of Germany. Anthropologists now use the name for humans who lived throughout Europe from about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago. Fossilized skulls indicate that Neanderthals had brains as large as ours, though somewhat different in shape. Neanderthals were also generally more heavily built than modern humans. Despite these differences, it is unlikely that an appropriately dressed Neanderthal misplaced in time would stand out from the crowd on a city street today.

Controversy surrounds the classification of fossils of the humans that lived in Europe, Asia, and Africa from about 500,000 to 100,000 years ago. These fossils represent the various regional descendants of H. erectus, including Neanderthals. One school of researchers refers to all of these regional forms as "archaic Homo sapiens," classifying them in the same species, but with subspecies names for the regional variants. In the view of these scientists, for example, the scientific name for Neanderthals should be Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. The other school restricts the name Homo sapiens to later fossils and gives separate species names to the regional fossils of the earlier period--for example, Homo neanderthalensis for the European fossils. Though this controversy may seem like trivial semantic quibbling, it is really a debate between advocates of alternative hypotheses for the origin of modern humans.

The Origin of Anatomically Modern Humans

When and where did fully modern humans--what paleoanthropologists call anatomically modern humans--originate?

One hypothesis for the origin of fully modern humans is that Homo sapiens evolved in each region from the local populations of H. erectus. This model of parallel evolution of modern humans is called the multiregional hypothesis (FIGURE 34.41a, p. 714). It is mainly advocates of this hypothesis who refer to the regional derivatives of H. erectus as "archaic Homo sapiens," giving the geographic variants of fossils subspecies names, such as H. sapiens neanderthalensis for European forms. In this view, the great genetic similarity of all modern people is the product of occasional interbreeding between neighboring populations that has provided corridors for gene flow throughout the geographic range of humans.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 34-41. Two hypotheses for the origin of anatomically modern humans. (a) Multiregional hypothesis. According to the multiregional hypothesis, modern humans evolved in many parts of the world from regional descendants of Homo erectus, who dispersed from Africa between 1 and 2 million years ago. The dashed line symbolizes interbreeding and gene flow between regional populations. (b) "Out of Africa" hypothesis (replacement hypothesis). According to the "Out of Africa" hypothesis, only the African descendants of Homo erectus gave rise to modern humans. All other regional descendants of H. erectus, including Neanderthals, became extinct without contributing significantly to the gene pool of modern humanity. Advocates of this hypothesis argue that anatomically modern humans began spreading from Africa just 100,000 years ago, giving rise to all the diverse human populations on Earth today.

On the other side of a very lively debate about human origins are the proponents of the "Out of Africa" hypothesis, also called the replacement hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, all Homo sapiens throughout the world evolved from a second major migration out of Africa that occurred about 100,000 years ago--a migration of anatomically modern humans that completely replaced all the regional populations of Homo derived from the first hominid migrations of H. erectus out of Africa about 1.5 million years ago (FIGURE 34.41b). Most advocates of the replacement hypothesis prefer to give separate species names to the regional hominids that were not anatomically modern, such as Homo neanderthalensis for the Neanderthals in Europe.

Note that both hypotheses recognize the fossil evidence for humanity's African origin. The debate centers on the vintage of the most recent hominid ancestor in Africa common to all the world's modern populations. The multiregional hypothesis places that last common ancestor in Africa over 1.5 million years ago, when H. erectus began migrating to other parts of the world. But according to the replacement hypothesis, the diverse human populations of the world are much more closely related. In this view, all of the world's populations diverged from anatomically modern Homo sapiens that evolved from an African H. erectus population and then migrated throughout the world beginning only 100,000 years ago. These anatomically modern humans--Homo sapiens--completely replaced all the other regional descendants of H. erectus, including Neanderthals, which are therefore evolutionary dead ends in the view of the replacement hypothesis.

A third alternative to the multiregional and replacement hypotheses suggests that Homo sapiens dispersing from Africa 100,000 years ago interbred with the regional descendants of the earlier H. erectus migration. This hypothesis predicts that the genomes of the indigenous people around the globe today should reflect a complex mix of ancestries. More generally, the key to our past, and a way to test the predictions made by the competing hypotheses, is to assess our current genetic diversity.

So far, the genetic data have mostly supported the replacement hypothesis. One approach has been to compare the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) between population samples from various parts of the world. Using changes in the mtDNA as a molecular clock (see Chapter 25), researchers have reported a time of genetic divergence of about 100,000 years ago, consistent with the replacement hypothesis. Some other researchers question the reliability of this approach. However, studies of genetic markers from the nucleus have corroborated the mtDNA data in tracing the geographic branching of Homo sapiens to about 100,000 years ago. And in the late 1990s, the replacement hypothesis accrued further support from researchers who sequenced mtDNA extracted from Neanderthal bones. The multiregional hypothesis predicts that the mtDNA of modern Europeans should be more similar to this Neanderthal mtDNA than to mtDNA from modern humans indigenous to other geographic regions. But the mtDNA from four Neanderthals all fall completely outside the range of mtDNA for modern Europeans. These data suggest that Neanderthals contributed nothing to the ancestry of anatomically modern humans in Europe. So far, however, there have been no such comparisons of DNA between local fossils and local indigenous people in regions outside Europe, such as Asia.

In testing the predictions of contesting hypotheses on the origin of modern humans, perhaps the most important genetic data so far are comparisons of Y chromosomes that a large research team published in 2001. In contrast to other human chromosomes, copies of a Y chromosome transmitted from male to male through the generations of a family retain their genetic identity because there is no crossing over for the Y chromosome during meiosis (except for a very small portion, which may cross over with the X chromosome). The diversity among Y chromosomes is thus limited to mutations, which serve as markers for tracing the ancestry and relationships among males alive today. By comparing the Y chromosomes of males from various geographic regions, researchers were able to infer divergence from a common African ancestor less than 100,000 years ago. As one former advocate of the multiregional hypothesis put it when he learned of these Y-chromosome data: "I have undergone a conversion--a sort of epiphany. There are no old Y chromosome lineages [in modern humans]. There are no old mtDNA lineages. Period. It was total replacement." However, not all multiregionalists find the genetic data so conclusive.

So far, the fossil evidence has been less one-sided than the genetic data in testing the alternative explanations for the origin of modern humans. The fossil evidence in western Europe is consistent with a total replacement of Neanderthals about 40,000 years ago by anatomically modern humans, known as Cro-Magnons in the case of the European fossils. There is no evidence for a transition in skeletal morphology that would suggest interbreeding between Neanderthals and the later arrivals. Thus, for western Europe, at least, the fossil evidence corroborates the genetic evidence in support of the replacement hypothesis. However, the fossil data outside of Europe are more ambiguous. For example, some paleoanthropologists interpret certain Asian fossils to be intermediate between older fossils of H. erectus in Asia and skeletal features of modern Asians, a result predicted by the multiregional hypothesis (or implying interbreeding with H. erectus after modern humans arrived in Asia).

Scientific debates about our evolutionary history, including the origin of anatomically modern humans, will certainly continue to make paleonanthropology one of the most exciting research fields in science.

Though we are ending this unit of chapters on the evolution of biological diversity with the origin of modern humans, we do not mean to reinforce the common misconception of a "ladder of life leading from lowly microbes to lofty humanity." Biological diversity is the product of branching phylogeny, not ladderlike "progress," however we choose to measure it. The fact that there are more species of bony fishes alive today than all other verterbrates combined is a clear indication that our finned relatives are not outmoded underachievers that failed to get out of the water. The tetrapods--amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals--are derived from one fish population. As tetrapods diversified on land, fishes continued their branching evolution in the greatest portion of the biosphere's volume. Similarly, the ubiquitous presence of diverse prokaryotes throughout the biosphere today is a reminder of the enduring ability of these relatively simple organisms to keep up with the times through adaptive evolution. Biology exalts life's diversity, past and present.

This unit examines the biology of the flowering plants, or angiosperms. (The structure of algae, mosses, ferns, and gymnosperms was covered in Unit Five, along with the evolutionary relationships of these plant groups to the angiosperms.) With about 250,000 known species, the angiosperms are by far the most diverse and widespread group of land plants. As primary producers, flowering plants are at the base of the food web of nearly every terrestrial ecosystem. Most land animals, including humans, depend on plants directly or indirectly for sustenance. Science has increased agricultural productivity to such an extent that most of us are no longer directly involved in the growing of foods, but this is a recent development; most of us do not have to trace our ancestry too far back to find a farmer. Setting the stage for our study of plant biology, this chapter introduces the structural organization of flowering plants and how this organization develops from a single cell, the zygote.

A plant's continuous growth and development depend on processes that shape organs and generate specific patterns of specialized cells and tissues within those organs. Growth is the irreversible increase in mass that results from cell division and cell expansion. Development is the sum of all of the changes that progressively elaborate an organism's body. The early stages of growth and development--germination of the seed and emergence of the seedling--are among the topics of Chapter 38. Here we will study how plants continue to grow after their shoot and root systems are established.

A plant begins life as a single cell, the zygote formed by the union of egg and sperm. (Fertilization and embryonic development in plants are described in Chapter 38.) The main objective of plant developmental biology is to understand how this single cell gives rise to a multicellular plant of particular form with functionally integrated cells, tissues, and organs. With each meristematic cell possessing the same genetic information, why should one cell become a sieve-tube member in the phloem while another becomes a vessel element in the xylem? Or why should a particular region of the shoot apex give rise to leaves at one time and later to flowers? In considering these questions, we must bear in mind that plants have tremendous developmental plasticity. A plant's form, including height, branching patterns, and reproductive output, is greatly influenced by environmental factors, and a broad range of morphologies can result from the same genotype. (Chapter 39 considers how plants respond to environmental factors.)

Three developmental processes acting in concert are responsible for transforming the fertilized egg into a plant: growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation. The modern techniques of molecular biology are helping plant biologists explore how these processes give rise to plant form.





 Both genes and environment affect plant structure

In their long evolutionary journey from water onto land, plants became adapted by natural selection to the specific problems posed by terrestrial environments (see Chapters 29 and 30). A plant's structure reflects interactions with the environment on two time scales. Over the long term, entire plant species have, by natural selection, accumulated morphological adaptations that enhance survival and reproductive success in the environments in which they grow. For example, some desert plants, such as cacti, have leaves that are so highly reduced that the stem is actually the primary photosynthetic organ. This reduction in leaf size, and thus in surface area, is a morphological adaptation that reduces water loss. Over the short term, individual plants, far more than individual animals, exhibit structural responses to their specific environment. For example, look at how submersion in water affects leaf development in Cabomba, the aquatic plant illustrated in the opening illustration of this chapter. Those leaves that developed while the plant was submerged have a feathery appearance--a morphological adaptation that enhances photosynthesis by increasing the surface area of the leaf for the uptake of bicarbonate (HCO3-), the form in which CO2 occurs in water. In contrast, those leaves that develop when the growing plant reaches the surface are oval pads that aid in flotation (leaves to right of flower). The architecture of a plant is a dynamic process, continuously shaped by the plant's genetically directed growth pattern along with fine-tuning to the environment. In contrast, animal form is much less adjustable.

Even faster than a plant's structural responses to environmental changes are its physiological (functional) adjustments. Unlike cacti, most plants are rarely exposed to severe drought conditions and rely mainly on physiological adaptations to cope with drought stress. In the most common response, the plant produces a hormone that causes the stomata, the pores in the leaves through which most water is lost, to close. In our study of such responses, remember that structure and function are closely related. For example, we cannot understand the function of stomata unless we also examine the structure of the guard cells that border these pores.





 Plants have three basic organs: roots, stems, and leaves

The plant body is a hierarchy of structural levels, with emergent properties arising from the ordered arrangement and interactions of component parts (see Chapter 1). As in multicellular animals, the plant body consists of organs that are composed of different tissues, and these tissues are teams of different types of cells. Although our exploration of the plant body will emphasize features common to all angiosperms, we will also note some important variations among plants. In particular, the two plant groups called the monocots and the dicots differ in many anatomical details (FIGURE 35.1). The dicot group includes the largest class of angiosperms, the eudicots, along with some smaller classes in which the dicot-type anatomy evolved independently (see FIGURE 30.4).

Fig 35-1. A comparison of monocots and dicots. These two groups of angiosperms are named for the number of cotyledons, or seed leaves, present on the embryo of the plant. Monocots include orchids, bamboos, palms, lilies, and yuccas, as well as the grasses, such as wheat, corn, and rice. A few examples of dicots are roses, beans, sunflowers, and oaks (which are all eudicots, the largest class of angiosperms with the dicot-type anatomy).

The basic morphology of plants reflects their evolutionary history as terrestrial organisms that must simultaneously inhabit and draw resources from two very different environments--soil and air. Soil provides water and minerals, but air is the main source of CO2, and light does not penetrate far into the soil. The evolutionary solution to this separation of resources was differentiation of the plant body into two main systems: a subterranean root system and an aerial shoot system consisting of stems and leaves (FIGURE 35.2). (Flowers are shoots consisting of leaves and stems highly modified for sexual reproduction). Neither system can live without the other. Lacking chloroplasts and living in the dark, roots would starve without sugar and other organic nutrients imported from the photosynthetic tissues of the shoot system. Conversely, the shoot system depends on water and minerals absorbed from the soil by the roots. As we take a closer look at the morphology of roots and shoots, try to view these systems from the evolutionary perspective of adaptations to living on land.

Fig 35-2. Morphology of a flowering plant: an overview. The plant body is divided into a root system and a shoot system, connected by vascular tissue (purple strands in this diagram) that is continuous throughout the plant. The plant shown in this diagram is an idealized dicot.

The Root System

Roots anchor the plant in the soil, absorb minerals and water, and store food. Monocots, including grasses, generally have fibrous root systems consisting of a mat of thin roots that spread out below the soil surface. (Large monocots, such as palms and bamboo, are exceptional in having thicker roots.) The fibrous root system extends the plant's exposure to soil water and minerals and anchors it tenaciously to the ground (see FIGURE 35.1). Because their root systems are concentrated in the upper few centimeters of the soil, grasses hold the topsoil in place and make excellent ground cover for preventing erosion.

Many dicots have a taproot system, consisting of one large, vertical root (the taproot) that produces many smaller lateral, or branch, roots (see FIGURES 35.1 and 35.2). If you have ever tried to pull up a dandelion, then you probably appreciate that one of the primary functions of taproots is to firmly anchor the plant in the soil. In addition, taproots often store food. The plant consumes the food reserves during flowering and fruit production. For this reason, root crops, such as carrots, turnips, and sugar beet, are harvested before they flower. Taproots are particularly long in certain desert plants, which "tap" water sources located far belowground.

Although the entire root system helps anchor a plant, most absorption of water and minerals in both monocots and dicots occurs near the root tips, where vast numbers of tiny root hairs increase the surface area of the root enormously (FIGURE 35.3). Root hairs are extensions of individual epidermal cells on the root surface, not to be confused with lateral (branch) roots, which are multicellular organs. (You will learn about symbiotic relationships between plant roots and fungi and bacteria in Chapters 36 and 37.)

Fig 35-3. Radish root hairs. Growing by the thousands just behind the tip of each root, the hairs increase the surface area for the absorption of water and minerals by the roots (colorized SEM).

In addition to roots that extend from the base of the shoot, some plants have roots arising aboveground from stems or even from leaves. Such roots are said to be adventitious (from the Latin adventicius, extraneous), a term that describes any plant part that grows in an atypical location. The adventitious roots of some plants, including corn, function as props that help support tall stems.

The Shoot System: Stems and Leaves

Shoots consist of stems and leaves. Shoot systems may be vegetative (leaf bearing) or reproductive (flower bearing). Here, we focus on the morphology of vegetative shoots. We'll discuss the transition of vegetative shoots into reproductive shoots later in the chapter.

Stems. A stem is an alternating system of nodes, the points at which leaves are attached, and internodes, the stem segments between nodes (see FIGURE 35.2). In the angle (axil) formed by each leaf and the stem is an axillary bud, a structure that has the potential to form a vegetative branch. Most axillary buds of a young shoot are dormant (not growing). Thus, growth of a young shoot is usually concentrated at its apex (tip), where there is a terminal bud with developing leaves and a compact series of nodes and internodes.

The presence of the terminal bud is partly responsible for inhibiting the growth of axillary buds, a phenomenon called apical dominance. By concentrating resources on growing taller, apical dominance is an evolutionary adaptation that increases the plant's exposure to light. But what if an animal eats the top of the plant? Or what if, because of obstructions, light is more intense to the side of a plant than directly above it? Under such conditions, axillary buds break dormancy--that is, they start growing. A growing axillary bud gives rise to a vegetative branch complete with its own terminal bud, leaves, and axillary buds. Removing the terminal bud usually stimulates the growth of axillary buds. This is the rationale for pruning trees and shrubs and "pinching back" houseplants to make them bushy.

Modified shoots with diverse functions have evolved in many plants. These modified shoots, which include stolons, rhizomes, tubers, and bulbs, are often mistaken for roots (FIGURE 35.4). Stolons, such as the "runners" of strawberry plants, grow on the surface of the ground and enable a plant to colonize large areas asexually when the single parent plant fragments into many smaller offspring. Rhizomes, such as those of ginger plants, are horizontal stems similar to stolons except that they grow underground. Tubers, including potatoes, are the swollen ends of rhizomes specialized for storing food. Bulbs, such as onions, are vertical, underground shoots consisting mostly of the swollen bases of leaves that store food.

(b) Rhizomes, like the edible base of this ginger plant, are horizontal stems that grow underground.
(c) Tubers, such as these white potatoes, are swollen ends of rhizomes specialized for storing food. The "eyes" arranged in a spiral pattern around a potato are clusters of axillary buds that mark the nodes.
(d) Bulbs are vertical, underground shoots consisting mostly of the swollen bases of leaves that store food. You can see the many layers of modified leaves attached to the short stem by slicing an onion bulb lengthwise.

Leaves. Leaves are the main photosynthetic organs of most plants, although green stems also perform photosynthesis. Leaves vary extensively in form, but they generally consist of a flattened blade and a stalk, the petiole, which joins the leaf to a node of the stem (see FIGURE 35.2). Grasses and many other monocots lack petioles; instead, the base of the leaf forms a sheath that envelops the stem. Some monocots, including palm trees, do have petioles.

The leaves of monocots and dicots differ in the arrangement of their major veins (see FIGURE 35.1). Most monocots have parallel major veins that run the length of the leaf blade. In contrast, dicot leaves generally have a multibranched network of major veins.

Because leaf morphology varies extensively among plant species, plant taxonomists use characteristics such as leaf shape, spatial arrangement of leaves on a stem, and the pattern of a leaf's veins to help identify and classify plants. FIGURE 35.5 illustrates one variation: simple versus compound leaves. Most very large leaves are compound or doubly compound. This structural adaptation enables large leaves to withstand strong wind with less tearing and also confines some pathogens that invade the leaf to a single leaflet, rather than allowing the pathogens to spread to the entire leaf.

Fig 35-5. Simple versus compound leaves. A simple leaf has a single, undivided blade. The blade of a compound leaf is divided into several leaflets, which are themselves divided in a doubly compound leaf. You can distinguish a compound leaf from a stem with several closely spaced simple leaves by examining the locations of axillary buds. There is only one axillary bud per leaf. Thus, a compound leaf has a bud where its petiole attaches to the stem, but not at the bases of the individual leaflets.

Although most leaves are specialized for photosynthesis, some plants have leaves that have become adapted by evolution for other functions (FIGURE 35.6).

(b) The spines of cacti, such as this prickly pear, are actually leaves, and photosynthesis is carried out mainly by the fleshy green stems.

(d) In many plants, brightly colored leaves help attract pollinators to the flower. The red "petals" of the poinsettia are actually leaves that surround a group of flowers.





 Plant organs are composed of three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground

Each organ of a plant--leaf, stem, or root--has three tissue systems: the dermal, vascular, and ground tissue systems. Each tissue system is continuous throughout the plant body, although the specific characteristics of the tissues and their spatial relationships to one another vary in different organs of the plant (FIGURE 35.7). Here we survey the three tissue systems as they occur in a young, nonwoody plant.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 35-7. The three tissue systems. The dermal tissue system--epidermis (white) in the case of a young, nonwoody organ--is a single layer of cells that covers the entire body of a young plant. The vascular tissue system (purple) is also continuous throughout the plant, but is arranged differently in each organ. The ground tissue system (yellow), responsible for most of the plant's metabolic functions, is located between the dermal tissue and the vascular tissue in each organ.

The dermal tissue, or epidermis, is generally a single layer of tightly packed cells that covers and protects all young parts of the plant--the "skin" of the plant. In addition to the general function of protection, the epidermis has more specialized characteristics consistent with the function of the particular organ it covers. For example, the root hairs so important in the absorption of water and minerals are extensions of epidermal cells near the tips of roots. The epidermis of leaves and most stems secretes a waxy coating called the cuticle that helps the aerial parts of the plant retain water--an important adaptation to living on land (see p. 581).

Vascular tissue, continuous throughout the plant, is involved in the transport of materials between roots and shoots. The two types of vascular tissue are xylem, which conveys water and dissolved minerals upward from roots into the shoots, and phloem, which transports food made in mature leaves to the roots and to nonphotosynthetic parts of the shoot system, such as developing leaves and fruits. Both xylem and phloem are composed of a variety of cell types, but those directly involved in long-distance transport are so highly modified as to warrant special discussion.

The water-conducting elements of xylem, the tracheids and vessel elements, are elongated cells that are dead at functional maturity. The term functional maturity refers to the stage in a cell's development when it is fully specialized for its function. When the living interior of a tracheid or vessel element disintegrates, the cell's thickened cell walls remain behind, forming a nonliving conduit through which water can flow (FIGURE 35.8). Both tracheids and vessels form in parts of the plant that are no longer elongating. Their secondary walls are interrupted only by pits, thinner regions where only primary walls are present (see FIGURE 7.28 to review primary and secondary walls). Tracheids are long, thin cells with tapered ends. Water moves from cell to cell mainly through the pits, where the water does not have to cross thick secondary walls. Because their secondary walls are hardened with lignin, tracheids function in support as well as water transport. Vessel elements are generally wider, shorter, thinner walled, and less tapered than tracheids. Vessel elements are aligned end to end, forming long micropipes, the xylem vessels. The end walls of vessel elements are perforated, enabling water to flow freely through xylem vessels.

(b) Vessel elements are linked together end to end, forming long tubes, or xylem vessels. Water streams from cell to cell through perforated end walls. Water can also migrate laterally between neighboring vessels through pits.
(c) Wood is composed mostly of tracheids and vessels (SEM).

In the phloem, sucrose, other organic compounds, and some mineral ions are transported through tubes formed by chains of cells called sieve-tube members (FIGURE 35.9). Sieve-tube members are alive at functional maturity, although they lack such organelles as the nucleus, ribosomes, and a distinct vacuole. In angiosperms, the end walls between sieve-tube members, called sieve plates, have pores that presumably facilitate the flow of fluid from cell to cell along the sieve tube. Alongside each sieve-tube member is a nonconducting cell called a companion cell, which is connected to the sieve-tube member by numerous channels, the plasmodesmata (see FIGURE 7.8). The nucleus and ribosomes of the companion cell may serve not only that cell but also the adjacent sieve-tube member, which has no nucleus or ribosomes of its own. In some plants, companion cells in leaves also help load sugar produced in the leaf into the sieve-tube members. The phloem then transports the sugar to other parts of the plant.

Sieve-tube members transport a sugar-rich sap from areas of sugar production (such as leaves) to areas of sugar consumption (such as growing root and shoot tips). (a) This diagram of a longitudinal view shows how the sieve-tube members are arranged end to end with porous walls (sieve plates) between them. Alongside each sieve-tube member is a nucleated companion cell. (b) A transverse section showing two sieve-tube members sectioned through sieve plates.

Ground tissue is tissue that is neither dermal tissue nor vascular tissue (see FIGURE 35.7). In dicot stems, ground tissue is divided into pith, internal to the vascular tissue, and cortex, external to the vascular tissue. Ground tissue is more than just filler; among its diverse functions are photosynthesis, storage, and support. In fact, ground tissue illustrates the point that each tissue system of a plant consists of a variety of cell types. The cortex of a dicot stem, for example, typically consists of both fleshy storage cells and thick-walled support cells. All plant tissues consist of a variety of the three basic plant cell types that we discuss in the next section.





 Plant tissues are composed of three basic cell types: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma

A multicellular organism is characterized by a division of labor among cell types specialized for different functions. As you consider each major type of plant cell, notice the structural adaptations that make specific functions possible. In some cases, we will find distinguishing characteristics within the protoplast, the cell contents exclusive of the cell wall. For example, only the protoplasts of photosynthetic cells contain chloroplasts. But modifications of cell walls are also important in how the specialized cells of a plant function. FIGURE 35.10 will help you review the general structure of plant cells before you proceed to our survey of specific cell types.

Fig 35-10. Review of general plant cell structure.

Parenchyma Cells

Mature parenchyma cells have primary walls that are relatively thin and flexible, and most lack secondary walls. The protoplast generally has a large central vacuole. Parenchyma cells are often depicted as "typical" plant cells because they generally are the least specialized (FIGURE 35.11a, p. 728), but there are exceptions. For example, the highly specialized cells that function in the transport of sugar sap in the phloem--the sieve-tube members--are thin walled and living and are examples of parenchyma cells.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 35-11. The three major categories of plant cells.

Parenchyma cells perform most of the metabolic functions of the plant, synthesizing and storing various organic products. For example, photosynthesis occurs within the chloroplasts of parenchyma cells in the leaf. Some parenchyma cells in stems and roots have colorless plastids that store starch. And the fleshy tissue of most fruit is composed mostly of parenchyma cells.

Developing plant cells of all types are parenchyma cells before specializing further in structure and function. Those cells that retain the less specialized condition and become mature parenchyma cells do not generally undergo cell division. Most of them, however, retain the ability to divide and differentiate into other types of plant cells under special conditions--during the repair and replacement of organs after injury to the plant, for example. It is even possible in the laboratory to regenerate an entire plant from a single parenchyma cell.

Collenchyma Cells

Collenchyma cells have thicker primary walls than parenchyma cells, though the walls are unevenly thickened (FIGURE 35.11b). Grouped in strands or cylinders, collenchyma cells help support young parts of the plant shoot. Young stems and petioles often have a cylinder of collenchyma just below their surface (the "strings" of a celery stalk, for example). Because they lack secondary walls and the hardening agent lignin is absent in their primary walls, collenchyma cells provide support without restraining growth. Unlike sclerenchyma cells, which we discuss next, mature, functioning collenchyma cells are living and flexible and elongate with the stems and leaves they support.

Sclerenchyma Cells

Also functioning as supporting elements in the plant, but with thick secondary walls usually strengthened by lignin, sclerenchyma cells are much more rigid than collenchyma cells. Mature sclerenchyma cells cannot elongate, and they occur in regions of the plant that have stopped growing in length. So specialized are sclerenchyma cells for support that many are dead at functional maturity, but they produce secondary walls before the protoplast dies. The rigid walls remain as a "skeleton" that supports the plant. In parts of the plant that are still elongating, the secondary walls of sclerenchyma are deposited unevenly in spiral or ring patterns like the wire helix that reinforces the wall of a vacuum hose. These forms of cell wall thickenings enable the cell wall to stretch like a spring as the cell grows.

The water-conducting vessel elements and tracheids in the xylem are sclerenchyma cells with dual functions: support and transport. But there are also two types of sclerenchyma cells called fibers and sclereids that specialize entirely in support (see FIGURE 35.11c). Long, slender, and tapered, fibers usually occur in groups. Some plant fibers are used commercially, such as hemp fibers for making rope and flax fibers for weaving into linen. Sclereids, which are shorter than fibers and irregular in shape, impart the hardness to nutshells and seed coats and the gritty texture to pear fruits.

So far, our description of the types of plant tissues and cells has focused on their structure and arrangement in mature organs of the plant. But how does this organization arise? A major difference between plants and most animals is that the growth and development of plants is not just limited to an embryonic or juvenile period, but occurs throughout the life of the plant. At any given instance, a typical plant consists of embryonic organs, developing organs, and mature organs.





 Meristems generate cells for new organs throughout the lifetime of a plant: an overview of plant growth

Most plants continue to grow as long as the plant lives, a condition known as indeterminate growth. In contrast, most animals and certain plant organs, such as flowers and leaves, undergo determinate growth; that is, they cease growing after reaching a certain size. Indeterminate growth does not imply immortality. Although they continue to grow throughout their lives, plants, of course, do die. Plants known as annuals complete their life cycle--from germination through flowering and seed production to death--in a single year or less. Many wildflowers are annuals, as are the most important food crops, including the cereal grains and legumes. A plant is called a biennial if its life generally spans two years. In many cases, plants with this biennial life cycle are those that live through an intervening cold period (winter) between vegetative growth (first spring/summer) and flowering (second spring/summer). Beets and carrots are biennials, but we rarely leave them in the ground long enough to see them flower. Plants that live many years, including trees, shrubs, and some grasses, are known as perennials. Some of the buffalo grass of the North American plains is believed to have been growing for 10,000 years from seeds that sprouted at the close of the last ice age. When a perennial plant finally dies, it is not usually from old age, but from an infection or some environmental trauma, such as fire or severe drought.

For as long as it survives, a plant is capable of indeterminate growth because it has perpetually embryonic tissues called meristems in its regions of growth. Meristematic cells divide to generate additional cells. Some of the products of this division remain in the meristematic region to produce still more cells, while others become specialized and are incorporated into the tissues and organs of the growing plant. Cells that remain as wellsprings of new cells in the meristem are called initials. The new cells that are displaced from the meristem, called derivatives, continue to divide for some time, until the cells they produce begin to specialize within developing tissues.

The pattern of plant growth depends on the locations of the meristems (FIGURE 35.12). Apical meristems, located at the tips of roots and in the buds of shoots, supply cells for the plant to grow in length. This elongation, called primary growth, enables roots to ramify throughout the soil and shoots to increase their exposure to light and carbon dioxide. In herbaceous (nonwoody) plants, only primary growth occurs. In woody plants, however, there is also secondary growth, a progressive thickening of the roots and shoots formed earlier by primary growth. Secondary growth is the product of lateral meristems, cylinders of dividing cells extending along the length of roots and shoots. One lateral meristem replaces the epidermis with a secondary dermal tissue, such as bark, that is thicker and tougher. A second lateral meristem adds layers of vascular tissue. Wood is the secondary xylem that accumulates over the years.

Apical meristems (blue in this diagram) are located near the tips of roots and shoots and are responsible for primary growth, or growth in length. Woody plants also have lateral meristems (red here) that function in secondary growth, which adds girth to roots and shoots.

In woody plants, primary and secondary growth occur simultaneously but in different locations. Primary growth is restricted to the youngest parts of the plant--the tips of roots and shoots, where the apical meristems are located. The lateral meristems develop in slightly older regions of the roots and shoots, some distance away from the tips. There, secondary growth adds girth to the organs. The oldest region of a root or shoot--the base of a tree branch, for example--has the greatest accumulation of secondary tissues formed by the lateral meristems. Each growing season, primary growth produces young extensions of roots and shoots, while secondary growth thickens and strengthens the older parts of the plant.

Examine a winter twig of a deciduous tree, and you can see the relationship between primary and secondary growth. At the tip is the dormant terminal bud, enclosed by scales that protect its apical meristem (FIGURE 35.13). In spring, the bud will shed its scales and begin a new spurt of primary growth, producing a series of nodes and internodes. Along each growth segment, nodes are marked by scars left when leaves fell during autumn. Above each leaf scar is either an axillary bud or a branch twig formed by an axillary bud. Farther down the twig are whorls of scars left by the scales that enclosed the terminal bud during the previous winter. Each spring and summer, as primary growth extends the shoot, secondary growth thickens the parts of the shoot that formed in previous years.

 Primary growth: Apical meristems extend roots and shoots by giving rise to the primary plant body

Primary growth produces the primary plant body--the parts of the root and shoot systems produced by apical meristems. An herbaceous plant and the youngest parts of a woody plant represent the primary plant body. Although apical meristems are responsible for the extension of both roots and shoots, there are important differences in the primary growth of these two systems.

Primary Growth of Roots

The root tip is covered by a thimblelike root cap, which physically protects the delicate meristem as the root pushes through the abrasive soil during primary growth. The cap also secretes a polysaccharide slime that lubricates the soil around the growing root tip. Growth in length is concentrated near the root's tip, where three zones of cells at successive stages of primary growth are located. From the root tip upward, they are the zone of cell division, the zone of elongation, and the zone of maturation. These regions grade together, with no sharp boundaries (FIGURE 35.14).

Fig 35-14. Primary growth of a root. The diagram and light micrograph take us into the tip of an onion root. Mitosis is concentrated in the zone of cell division, where the apical meristem and its products, the three primary meristems, are located. The apical meristem also maintains the root cap by generating new cells that replace those that are sloughed off. If the apical meristem is damaged, its quiescent center is activated and restores the meristem by means of cell division. Most lengthening of the root is concentrated in the zone of elongation. Cells become functionally mature in the zone of maturation. The zones of the root grade into one another without sharp boundaries.

The zone of cell division includes the apical meristem and its derivatives, called primary meristems. The apical meristem, at the heart of the zone of cell division, produces the cells of the primary meristems and also replaces cells of the root cap that are sloughed off. Near the center of the apical meristem is the quiescent center, a population of cells that divide much more slowly than the other meristematic cells. Cells of the quiescent center are relatively resistant to damage from radiation and toxic chemicals, and they may function as reserves that can be recruited to restore the meristem if it is somehow damaged. In experiments where part of the apical meristem is removed, cells of the quiescent center become more mitotically active and produce a new meristem.

Just above the apical meristem, the products of its cell division form three concentric cylinders of cells that continue to divide for some time. These are the primary meristems--the protoderm, procambium, and ground meristem--that will produce the three primary tissue systems of the root: dermal, vascular, and ground tissues.

The zone of cell division blends into the zone of elongation. Here the cells elongate, sometimes to more than ten times their original length. Although the meristem provides the new cells for growth, the elongation of cells is mainly responsible for pushing the root tip, including the meristem, ahead. The meristem sustains growth by continuously adding cells to the youngest end of the zone of elongation.

Even before they finish elongating, the cells of the root begin to specialize in structure and function where the zone of elongation grades into the zone of maturation. In this region of the root, the three tissue systems produced by primary growth complete their differentiation, their cells becoming functionally mature.

Primary Tissues of Roots. The three primary meristems give rise to the three primary tissues of roots. The light micrographs in FIGURE 35.15 show, in transverse (cross) section, the three primary tissue systems in the roots of a dicot (Ranunculus, a buttercup) and a monocot (Zea, corn). The protoderm, the outermost primary meristem, gives rise to the epidermis, a single layer of cells covering the root. Water and minerals absorbed by the plant from the soil must enter through the epidermis. The root hairs enhance this process by greatly increasing the surface area of epidermal cells.

The procambium gives rise to the stele, which in roots is a central cylinder of vascular tissue where both xylem and phloem develop. The main difference between dicot and monocot roots is the organization of tissues within the stele. In dicot roots, the stele is a cylinder made up almost entirely of differentiated phloem and xylem cells. In monocot roots, however, the most centrally located cells in the stele do not typically differentiate, remaining instead as unspecialized parenchyma cells. Although this region is often referred to as pith, it should not be confused with the stem pith, which is part of the ground tissue system rather than the vascular tissue system. In dicots, the xylem cells radiate from the center of the stele in two or more spokes, with phloem developing in the wedges between the spokes. In the monocot root, the pith of the stele is generally ringed by vascular tissue with an alternating pattern of xylem and phloem.

Between the protoderm and procambium is the ground meristem, which gives rise to the ground tissue system. The ground tissue, which consists mostly of parenchyma cells, fills the cortex, the region of the root between the stele and epidermis. Ground tissue cells of the root store food, and their plasma membranes are active in the uptake of minerals that enter the root with the soil solution. The innermost layer of the cortex is the endodermis, a cylinder one cell thick that forms the boundary between the cortex and the stele in the roots of both monocots and dicots. You will learn in Chapter 36 how the endodermis functions as a selective barrier that regulates the passage of substances from the soil solution into the vascular tissue of the stele.

An established root may sprout lateral roots, which arise from the outermost layer of the stele, the pericycle (see FIGURE 35.15). Just inside the endodermis, the pericycle is a layer of cells that may become meristematic and begin dividing again. Originating as a clump of cells formed by mitosis in the pericycle, a lateral root elongates and pushes through the cortex until it emerges from the main root (FIGURE 35.16). The stele of the lateral root retains its connection with the stele of the primary root, making the vascular tissue continuous throughout the root system.

Primary Growth of Shoots

The apical meristem of a shoot is a dome-shaped mass of dividing cells at the tip of the terminal bud (FIGURE 35.17). As in the root, the apical meristem of the shoot tip gives rise to the primary meristems--protoderm, procambium, and ground meristem--that will differentiate into the three tissue systems. Leaves arise as leaf primordia on the flanks of the apical meristem. Axillary buds develop from islands of meristematic cells left by the apical meristem at the bases of the leaf primordia.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 35-17. The terminal bud and primary growth of a shoot. Leaf primordia arise from the flanks of the apical dome. The apical meristem gives rise to protoderm, procambium, and ground meristem, which in turn develop into the three tissue systems. This is a longitudinal section of the shoot tip of Coleus (LM).

Within a bud, leaf primordia are crowded close together because internodes are very short. Most of the actual elongation of the shoot occurs by the growth in length of slightly older internodes below the shoot apex. This growth is due to both cell division and cell elongation within the internode. In some plants, including grasses, internodes continue to elongate all along the length of the shoot over a prolonged period. This is possible because these plants have meristematic regions, called intercalary meristems, at the base of each internode.

Axillary buds have the potential to form branches of the shoot system at some later time (see FIGURE 35.2). Thus, there is an important difference in how roots and shoots form lateral organs. Lateral roots originate from deep within a main root as outgrowths from the pericycle (see FIGURE 35.16). In contrast, branches of the shoot system originate from axillary buds, at the surface of a main shoot. Only by extending from the pericycle can a lateral root be connected to the vascular system. The vascular tissue of a stem, however, is near the surface, and branches can develop with connections to the vascular tissue without having to originate from deep within the main shoot.

Primary Tissues of Stems. Vascular tissue runs the length of a stem in strands called vascular bundles (FIGURE 35.18). This arrangement contrasts with that of the root, where the vascular tissue forms a vascular cylinder in the center of the root (see FIGURE 35.15). At the transition zone where the stem grades into the root, the vascular bundles of the stem converge as the root's vascular cylinder.

Fig 35-18. Organization of primary tissues in young stems.

Each vascular bundle of the stem is surrounded by ground tissue. In most dicots, the vascular bundles are arranged in a ring, with pith to the inside of the ring and cortex external to the ring (see FIGURE 35.18a). Both pith and cortex are part of the ground tissue system. The vascular bundles have their xylem facing the pith and their phloem facing the cortex side. Thin rays of ground tissue between the vascular bundles connect the pith and cortex. In the stems of most monocots, the vascular bundles are scattered throughout the ground tissue rather than being arranged in a ring (see FIGURE 35.18b). In both monocots and dicots, the ground tissue of the stem is mostly parenchyma, but many stems are strengthened by collenchyma located just beneath the epidermis. Sclerenchyma, in the form of fiber cells within vascular bundles, also helps support stems.

The protoderm of the terminal bud gives rise to the epidermis, which covers stems and leaves as part of the continuous dermal tissue system.

Tissue Organization of Leaves. The leaf epidermis is composed of cells tightly interlocked like pieces of a puzzle (FIGURE 35.19). Like our own skin, the leaf epidermis is a first line of defense against physical damage and pathogenic organisms. Also, the waxy cuticle of the epidermis is a barrier to the loss of water from the plant. The epidermal barrier is interrupted only by the stomata, tiny pores flanked by specialized epidermal cells called guard cells. Each stoma is actually a gap between a pair of guard cells. The stomata allow gas exchange between the surrounding air and the photosynthetic cells inside the leaf. Stomata are also major avenues for the evaporative loss of water from the plant--a process called transpiration.

Fig 35-19. Leaf anatomy. (a) This cutaway drawing of a leaf illustrates the organization of the three tissue systems: dermal tissue (epidermis), vascular tissue, and ground tissue (the mesophyll region consisting of palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma). (b) This surface view of a Tradescantia leaf shows the cells of the epidermis and stomata, with their guard cells (LM). (c) Palisade and spongy regions of mesophyll are present within the leaf of a lilac, a dicot (LM).

The ground tissue of a leaf is sandwiched between the upper and lower epidermis in the region called mesophyll (from the Greek mesos, middle, and phyll, leaf). It consists mainly of parenchyma cells equipped with chloroplasts and specialized for photosynthesis. The leaves of many dicots have two distinct regions of mesophyll. On the upper part of the leaf are one or more layers of palisade parenchyma, made up of cells that are columnar in shape. Below the palisade region is the spongy parenchyma, which gets its name from the labyrinth of air spaces through which carbon dioxide and oxygen circulate around the irregularly shaped cells and up to the palisade region. The air spaces are particularly large in the vicinity of stomata, where gas exchange with the outside air occurs.

The vascular tissue of a leaf is continuous with the xylem and phloem of the stem. Leaf traces, which are branches from vascular bundles in the stem, pass through petioles and into leaves. Within a leaf, veins subdivide repeatedly and branch throughout the mesophyll. This brings xylem and phloem into close contact with the photosynthetic tissue, which obtains water and minerals from the xylem and loads its sugars and other organic products into the phloem for shipment to other parts of the plant. The vascular infrastructure also functions as a skeleton that reinforces the shape of the leaf.





 Secondary growth: Lateral meristems add girth by producing secondary vascular tissue and periderm

The stems and roots, but not the leaves, of most dicots increase in girth by secondary growth. The secondary plant body consists of the tissues produced during this secondary growth in diameter. Two lateral meristems function in secondary growth: the vascular cambium, which produces secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem, and the cork cambium, which produces a tough, thick covering for stems and roots that replaces the epidermis. Secondary growth occurs in all gymnosperms. Among angiosperms, secondary growth takes place in most dicot species but is rare in monocots.

Secondary Growth of Stems

Vascular Cambium and the Production of Secondary Vascular Tissue. The vascular cambium is a cylinder of meristematic cells that forms secondary vascular tissue (see FIGURE 35.12). The accumulation of this secondary vascular tissue over the years accounts for most of the increase in the diameter of a woody plant. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem to its interior and secondary phloem to its exterior (FIGURE 35.20). A tree grows in girth as the diameter of the cylinder of vascular cambium increases over time, laying down successive layers of secondary tissues, each with a larger diameter than the last.

Fig 35-20. Production of secondary xylem and phloem by the vascular cambium. This diagram traces the radial file of cells that develops from the meristematic activity of a single cell of the vascular cambium. The cambium ell (C) gives rise to secondary xylem (X) on the inside and secondary phloem (P) on the outside. Each time a cambium cell divides, one daughter cell retains its status as an initial, and the other, the derivative (D), differentiates into a xylem or phloem cell., As layers of xylem are added. vascular cambium itself increases in diameter.

It is important to understand that primary and secondary growth occur simultaneously but in different regions of a stem. While the apical meristem serves to elongate the stem, secondary growth commences farther down the shoot. How does the primary plant body of a young shoot make the transition from primary to secondary growth? The vascular cambium forms from parenchyma cells that regain the capacity to divide; that is, the cells become meristematic. This meristem forms in a layer between the primary xylem and primary phloem of each vascular bundle and in the rays of ground tissue between the bundles. The meristematic bands within the vascular bundles and rays unite to form the vascular cambium as a continuous cylinder of dividing cells surrounding the primary xylem and pith of the stem (FIGURE 35.21, p. 736).

Fig 35-21. Secondary growth of a stem. You can track the progress of secondary growth by examining the sections through sequentially older parts of the stem. (You would observe the same changes if you could follow the youngest region, near the apex, for the next three years.)

Viewed in cross section, the cylinder of vascular cambium appears as a ring. If we trace around the ring, there are alternating regions of cambium cells called ray initials and fusiform initials. The ray initials are cambium cells that produce radial files of parenchyma cells known as xylem rays and phloem rays. These rays separate wedge-shaped sections of secondary vascular tissue. Xylem and phloem rays, consisting mainly of parenchyma, function as living avenues for the radial transport of water and nutrients within a woody stem and in the storage of starch and other reserves. The cambium cells within the vascular bundles are the fusiform initials, a name that refers to the shape of these cells, which have tapered (fusiform) ends and are elongated along the axis of the stem. Fusiform initials produce new vascular tissue, forming secondary xylem to the inside of the vascular cambium and forming secondary phloem to the outside (see FIGURE 35.20).

As secondary growth continues over the years, layer upon layer of secondary xylem accumulates, producing the tissue we call wood. Wood consists mainly of tracheids, vessel elements (in angiosperms), and fibers. These cells, dead at functional maturity, have thick, lignified walls that give wood its hardness and strength. In temperate regions of the world, secondary growth in perennial plants is interrupted each year when the vascular cambium becomes dormant during winter. When secondary growth resumes in the spring, the first tracheids and vessel cells to develop usually have relatively large diameters and thin walls compared to the secondary xylem produced later in the summer. Thus, it is usually possible to distinguish early wood (usually produced during spring) from late wood (usually produced during summer) (see FIGURE 35.21, p. 736).

The structure of the early wood maximizes delivery of water to new, expanding leaves during the start of the growth season. Though the thick-walled cells of late wood do not transport as much water as the cells of early wood, they add more physical support to the tree than do the thinner-walled cells. The annual growth rings that are evident in the cross sections of most tree trunks in temperate regions result from the yearly activity of the vascular cambium: cambium dormancy, early wood production, and late wood production. The boundary between one year's growth and the next is usually quite conspicuous, allowing us to estimate the age of a tree by counting its annual rings.

Cork Cambium and the Production of Periderm. During the early stages of secondary growth, the epidermis produced by primary growth splits, dries, and falls off the stem. It is replaced by new protective tissues produced by the cork cambium, a cylinder of meristematic tissue that first forms in the outer cortex of the stem and later in the secondary phloem (FIGURE 35.22). Cork cambium produces cork cells, which accumulate to the cambium's exterior. As the cork cells mature, they deposit a waxy material called suberin in their walls and then die. The cork tissue then functions as a barrier that helps protect the stem from physical damage and pathogens. And because cork is waxy, it impedes water loss from the stems. Together, the layers of cork plus the cork cambium make up the periderm. This is the protective coat of the secondary plant body that replaces the epidermis of the primary body. In localized areas, the periderm may split open because the cork cambium is more active than elsewhere. These regions, called lenticels, make it possible for living cells within the trunk to exchange gases with the outside air for cellular respiration.

Fig 35-22. Anatomy of a three-year-old stem(LM).

The term bark, more inclusive than periderm, refers to all tissues external to the vascular cambium. Thus, in an outward direction, bark consists of the secondary phloem, the cork cambium, and cork. Put another way, bark is phloem plus periderm (see FIGURES 35.21 lower right and 35.22).

Unlike the vascular cambium, which grows in diameter, the original cork cambium is a cylinder of fixed size. After a few weeks of cork production, the cork cambium loses its meristematic activity, and its remaining cells differentiate into cork. Expansion of the stem splits the original periderm. How is it renewed to keep pace with continued secondary growth? New cork cambium forms deeper and deeper in the cortex. Eventually, no cortex is left, and the cork cambium then develops from parenchyma cells in the secondary phloem.

Only the youngest secondary phloem, which is internal to the cork cambium, functions in sugar transport. The older secondary phloem, outside the cork cambium, dies and helps protect the stem until it is sloughed off as part of the bark during later seasons of secondary growth. This is why secondary phloem does not accumulate as extensively over the years as the secondary xylem does.

Examining an old tree trunk in cross section enables us to see the result of many years of secondary stem growth. Beginning at the center of the tree and tracing outward, we can distinguish several zones (FIGURE 35.23). Heartwood and sapwood both consist of secondary xylem. Heartwood is older and no longer functions in water transport; the lignified walls of its dead cells form a central column that supports the tree. This wood owes its rich color to resins and other compounds that clog the cell cavities and help protect the core of the tree from fungi and wood-boring insects. Sapwood is so named because its secondary xylem still functions in the upward transport of water and minerals (xylem sap). Because each new layer of secondary xylem has a larger circumference, secondary growth enables the xylem to transport more sap each year, providing water and minerals to an increasing number of leaves.

Secondary Growth of Roots

The two lateral meristems, vascular cambium and cork cambium, also develop and produce secondary growth in roots. The vascular cambium forms within the stele and produces secondary xylem to its inside and secondary phloem to its outside. As the stele grows in diameter, the cortex and epidermis are split and shed. A cork cambium forms from the pericycle of the stele and produces the periderm, which becomes the secondary dermal tissue. Unlike the primary epidermis of a younger root, periderm is impermeable to water. Therefore, it is only the youngest parts of roots, those representing the primary plant body, that absorb water and minerals from the soil. Older parts of roots, with secondary growth, function mainly to anchor the plant and to transport water and solutes between the younger roots and the shoot system.

Over the years, the root becomes woodier, and annual rings are evident in the secondary xylem. The tissues external to the vascular cambium form a thick, tough bark. After extensive secondary growth, old stems and old roots are quite similar.

So far we have described the development of the plant body from meristems. In the next section, we'll move from a description of plant growth and development to the mechanisms that underlie these processes.





 Molecular biology is revolutionizing the study of plants

Plant biology is in the midst of a renaissance. New laboratory and field methods coupled with clever choices of experimental organisms have catalyzed a research explosion. For example, many scientists interested in the genetic control of plant development, including Joanne Chory, whom you met in the interview on pages 718-719, are focusing their research on Arabidopsis thaliana, a little weed of the mustard family (FIGURE 35.25). Arabidopsis is small enough to allow researchers to cultivate thousands of the plants in a few square meters of lab space. Arabidopsis also has a short generation span of about six weeks, making it an excellent model for genetic studies. Plant biologists are also attracted to Arabidopsis by its tiny genome; the amount of DNA per cell ranks among the least of all known plants. Because of these attributes, Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, a multinational effort that took six years to complete.

Fig 35-25. Arabidopsis thaliana. Owing to its small size, rapid life cycle, and small genome, Arabidopsis (inset) was the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced (some 26,000 genes). The pie chart represents the proportion of Arabidopsis genes in different functional categories.

Arabidopsis possesses about 26,000 genes, but many of these are duplicates--there are probably fewer than 15,000 different types of genes. This level of complexity is similar to that found in the fly Drosophila. Knowing what some of the Arabidopsis genes do has already expanded our understanding of plant development. However, the functions of about 45%  of Arabidopsis';s genes are unknown (FIGURE 35.25).

Now that the DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis genome is completely known, plant biologists have launched an ambitious quest to determine the function of every one of the plant's genes by the year 2010. By identifying each gene's function and tracking every chemical pathway, researchers aim to establish a blueprint for how plants are built. One of the key tasks will be to identify exactly which cells are manufacturing which gene products and at what stages in the plant's life. Researchers also plan to create mutants for every gene in the genome. As Joanne Chory predicted, it may one day be possible to create a computer-generated "virtual plant" that will enable researchers to visualize which plant genes are activated in different parts of the plant during the entire course of development.





 Growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation produce the plant body

Consider a small annual weed. It may consist of billions of cells--some large, some small, some highly specialized and others not, but all derived from a single fertilized egg. The increase in mass, or growth, that occurs during the life of the plant results from both cell division and cell expansion, but what controls these processes? Why do leaves stop growing upon reaching a certain size, whereas apical meristems divide perpetually? Also, note that the millions of cells in our hypothetical weed are not an undifferentiated clump of cells. They are organized into recognizable tissues and organs. Leaves arise from nodes; roots (unless adventitious) do not. Epidermis forms on the exterior of the leaf, and vascular tissue in the interior--never vice versa. This development of body form and organization is called morphogenesis. Each cell in the plant body contains the same set of genes, exact copies of the genome present in the fertilized egg. But how can this same set of genetic instructions produce such a diversity of cell types--guard cells, mesophyll, sieve-tube members, root hairs, and so on? This generation of cellular diversity is called differentiation (see p. 403).

Next, let's take a closer look at the molecular mechanisms that underlie growth, morphogenesis, and cellular differentiation in plants.





 Growth involves both cell division and cell expansion

Cell division in meristems, by increasing cell number, increases the potential for growth, but it is cell expansion that accounts for the actual increase in plant mass. The process of plant cell division is described more fully in Chapter 12 (see FIGURE 12.9) and the process of cell elongation in Chapter 39 (see FIGURE 39.7). Here we are more concerned with how these processes contribute to plant form.

The Plane and Symmetry of Cell Division

The plane (direction) of cell division is an important determinant of plant form (FIGURE 35.26a). Imagine a single cell poised to undergo mitosis. If the planes of division of its descendants are parallel to the plane of the first cell division, a single file of cells will be produced (FIGURE 35.26). At the other extreme, if the planes of cell division of the descendant cells are randomly aligned, an unorganized clump of cells will result. The plane of cell division is immensely important in determining form, but so is the symmetry of cell division. Although in earlier chapters we have emphasized the symmetry of chromosomal redistribution during mitosis, the same does not necessarily hold for the cytoplasm. Asymmetrical cell division, in which one daughter cell receives more cytoplasm than the other during mitosis, is fairly common in plant cells and usually signals a key event in development. For example, the formation of guard cells typically involves both an asymmetrical cell division and a change in the plane of the cell division. An epidermal cell divides asymmetrically to form a large cell that will remain an unspecialized epidermal cell and a small cell that will become the guard cell "mother cell." This small mother cell then undergoes another cell division, in a plane perpendicular to the first, to form the guard cells (FIGURE 35.26b).

Fig 35-26. The plane and symmetry of cell division influence development of form.

The plane in which a cell will divide is determined during late interphase. The first sign of this spatial orientation is a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules in the cortex (outer cytoplasm) of the cell become concentrated into a ring called the preprophase band (FIGURE 35.27). The band disappears before metaphase, but it has already set the future plane of cell division. The "imprint" consists of an ordered array of actin microfilaments that remain after the microtubules of the preprophase band disperse. These microfilaments hold the nucleus in a fixed orientation until the spindle forms, and later they direct movement of the vesicles that produce the cell plate (see FIGURE 12.8b). When the cell finally divides, the walls separating the daughter cells form in the plane defined earlier by the preprophase band.

Although the cells dhown on the left and right are similar in shpae. They will divide in different planes. Eachg cell is represented by two light micrographs, one (top) unstained and the other (bottom) stained with a fluorescent dye that binds specifically to microtubules. The stained microtubules form a "halo" (preprophase band) around the nucleus in the outer cytoplasm.

The Orientation of Cell Expansion

Before discussing how cell expansion contributes to plant form, it is useful to consider the difference in cell expansion between plants and animals. Animal cells grow mainly by synthesizing protein-rich cytoplasm, a metabolically expensive process. Growing plant cells also produce additional organic material in their cytoplasm, but the uptake of water typically accounts for about 90%  of a plant cell's expansion. Most of this water is packaged in the large central vacuole, which forms by the coalescence of numerous smaller vacuoles as a cell grows. A plant can grow rapidly and economically because a small amount of cytoplasm can go a long way. Bamboo shoots, for instance, may elongate more than 2 m per week. Rapid extension of shoots and roots increases the exposure to light and soil, an important evolutionary adaptation to the immobile lifestyle of plants.

Plant cells rarely expand equally in all directions. Their greatest expansion is usually oriented along the main axis of the plant. For example, cells near the root tip may elongate to 20 times their original length, with relatively little increase in width. The orientation of cellulose microfibrils in the innermost layers of the cell wall causes this differential growth. The microfibrils cannot stretch much, so the cell expands mainly in the direction perpendicular to the "grain" of the microfibrils, as shown in FIGURE 35.28. A rosette-shaped complex of enzymes built into the plasma membrane synthesizes microfibrils for the cell wall (FIGURE 35.29). The pattern of microfibrils in the wall mirrors the orientation of microtubules located just across the plasma membrane in the cortex of the cell. According to one hypothesis, the microtubules confine the flow of the cellulose-producing enzymes to a specific direction along the membrane. Each enzyme complex advances along one of these channels as the microfibril it extends becomes locked in place by cross-linking to other microfibrils. This specifies the alignment of microfibrils in the wall, which in turn determines the direction of cell expansion.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 35-28. The orientation of plant cell expansion. Growing plant cells expand mainly through water uptake. In a growing cell, enzymes weaken cross-links in the cell wall, allowing it to expand as water flows in by osmosis. The orientation of cell growth is mainly in the plane perpendicular to the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in the wall. The microfibrils are embedded in a matrix of other (noncellulose) polysaccharides, some of which form the cross-links visible in the micrograph (TEM). Loosening of the wall occurs when hydrogen ions secreted by the cell activate cell wall enzymes that break the cross-links between polymers in the wall. This reduces restraint on the turgid cell, which can take up more water and expand. Small vacuoles, which accumulate most of this water, coalesce and form the cell's central vacuole.

Fig 35-29. A hypothetical mechanism for how microtubules orient cellulose microfibrils. Cellolose microfibrils are synthesized at the cell surface by complexes of enzymes that can move in the plane of the plasma membrane. According to one hypothesis, microtubules form "banks" that confine the movement of the enzymes to channels of specified direction. Each enzyme complex advances along one of these channels as the microfibril it extends becomes locked in place by cross-linking to other microfibrils.

The Importance of Cortical Microtubules in Plant Growth

Studies of Arabidopsis mutants have confirmed the importance of cortical microtubules in both cell division and expansion. As an example, let's consider what are called fass mutants of Arabidopsis. Fass mutants have cells that are unusually squat and that seemingly align their planes of division in a random fashion. In the roots and stems of these mutants, the ordered cell files and layers normally present are completely absent. Despite these abnormalities, fass mutants do develop into tiny adult plants with all their parts, including flowers, but these organs are compressed longitudinally (FIGURE 35.30).

Fig 35-30. The fass mutant of Arabidopsis confirms the importance of cortical microtubules to plant growth. The squat body of the fass mutant results from cell division and cell elongation being randomly oriented instead of orienting in the direction of the normal plant axis.

The cortical microtubular organization of fass mutants is abnormal. Although the microtubules involved in chromosome movements and in cell plate deposition are normal, the preprophase bands do not form prior to mitosis (see FIGURE 35.27). In interphase cells, the cortical microtubules are not organized in arrays but are randomly positioned, so the cellulose microfibrils deposited in the cell wall cannot be arranged to determine the direction of the cell's elongation (see FIGURES 35.28 and 35.29). This defect in cortical microtubular organization gives rise to cells that expand in all directions equally and that divide in a haphazard arrangement--hence the stout stature and disorganized tissue arrangement of these mutants.





 Morphogenesis depends on pattern formation

A plant's body is more than a collection of dividing and expanding cells. Morphogenesis must occur for development to proceed properly; that is, cells must be organized into multicellular arrangements such as tissues and organs. The development of specific structures in specific locations is called pattern formation.

Pattern formation depends to a large extent on positional information, signals of some kind that indicate each cell's location within an embryonic structure, such as a shoot tip. Within a developing organ, each cell continues to detect positional information and responds by differentiating into a particular type of cell. Developmental biologists are accumulating evidence that gradients of specific molecules, generally proteins, provide positional information. For example, a substance diffusing from a shoot's apical meristem may "inform" the cells below of their distance from the shoot tip. We can imagine that the cells gauge their radial positions within the developing organ by detecting a second chemical signal that emanates from the outermost cells. The gradients of these two substances would be sufficient for each cell to "get a fix" on its position relative to the longitudinal and radial axes of the rudimentary organ. This idea of diffusible chemical signals is just one of several alternative hypotheses that developmental biologists are testing to learn how an embryonic cell detects its location.

One type of positional information is associated with polarity. In plants, there is typically a well-developed axis, but the two ends of this axis are not the same; there is a root end and a shoot end. Such polarity is most obvious in morphological differences, but it is also manifest in several physiological properties, including the unidirectional movement of certain hormones (see Chapter 39) and the emergence of adventitious roots and shoots from the appropriate ends of "cuttings." Adventitious roots form from the root end of a stem or a root cutting, and shoots from the shoot end.

The first division of a plant zygote is normally asymmetrical, initiating polarization of the plant body into shoot and root. Once this polarity has been induced, it becomes exceedingly difficult to reverse. Thus, the proper establishment of axial polarity is a critical step in a plant's morphogenesis. In the gnom mutant of Arabidopsis, the establishment of polarity is defective. The first cell division of the zygote is abnormal in being symmetrical, and the resulting ball-shaped plant has neither roots nor cotyledons (seed leaves) (FIGURE 35.31).

Fig 35-31. Establishment of axial polarity. The normal Arabidopsis seedling (left) has a shoot end and a root end. In the gnom mutant (right), the first division of the zygote was not asymmetrical; as a result, the plant is ball-shaped and lacks cotyledons (seed leaves) and roots.

Let's examine another example of how genes regulate pattern formation and morphogenesis in plants. Plants, like other multicellular organisms, have master regulatory genes called homeotic genes (see Chapter 21) that mediate many of the major events in an individual's development, such as the initiation of an organ. For example, the protein product of the KNOTTED-1 homeotic gene, found in many plant species, is important in the development of leaf morphology, including the production of compound leaves. If the KNOTTED-1 gene is overexpressed in tomato plants, the normally compound leaves become "supercompound" (FIGURE 35.32).

 Cellular differentiation depends on the control of gene expression

It is remarkable that cells as diverse as guard cells, sieve-tube members (phloem), and xylem vessel elements all share the same DNA and all descend from a common cell, the zygote. This cellular differentiation occurs continuously throughout a plant's life, as meristems sustain indeterminate growth. Differentiation reflects the synthesis of different proteins in different types of cells (see Chapter 19). For example, two distinct cell types are formed in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis: root hair cells and hairless epidermal cells. Cell fate is associated with the position of the epidermal cells. Immature epidermal cells that are in contact with two underlying cortical cells differentiate into root hair cells, whereas those in contact with only one cortical cell differentiate into mature, hairless cells. A homeotic gene called GLABRA-2 is required for appropriate root hair distribution. GLABRA-2 is normally expressed only in epidermal cells that will not develop root hairs. If GLABRA-2 is rendered dysfunctional by mutation, every root epidermal cell develops a root hair. Researchers demonstrated this by coupling the GLABRA-2 gene to a "reporter gene" that causes every cell expressing GLABRA-2 in the root to turn blue following a certain treatment (FIGURE 35.33).

Fig 35-33. Example of cellular differentiation. Two distinct cell types are formed in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis: root hair cells and hairless epidermal cells.

What makes differentiation so fascinating is that the cells of a developing organism synthesize different proteins and diverge in structure and function even though they share a common genome. The cloning of whole plants from somatic cells supports the conclusion that the genome of a differentiated cell remains intact (see FIGURE 21.5). If a mature cell removed from a root or leaf can "dedifferentiate" in tissue culture and give rise to the diverse cell types of a plant, then it must possess all the genes necessary to make these many kinds of cells. This means that cellular differentiation depends, to a large extent, on the control of gene expression--the regulation of transcription and translation leading to specific proteins. Cells with the same genomes follow different developmental pathways because they selectively express certain genes at specific times during their differentiation. A guard cell has the genes that program the self-destruction of a xylem protoplast, but it does not express those genes. A xylem vessel cell does express them, but only at a specific time in its differentiation, after the cell has elongated and produced its secondary wall. Researchers are beginning to unravel the molecular mechanisms that switch specific genes on and off at critical times in a cell's development (see Chapters 19 and 21).





 Clonal analysis of the shoot apex emphasizes the importance of a cell's location in its developmental fate

In the process of shaping a rudimentary organ, patterns of cell division and cell expansion affect the differentiation of cells by placing them in specific locations relative to other cells. Thus, positional information underlies all the processes of development: growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation. One approach to studying the relationships among these processes is clonal analysis, in which the cell lineages (clones) derived from each cell in an apical meristem are mapped as organs develop. Researchers can do this by using radiation or chemicals to induce somatic mutations that alter chromosome number or otherwise tag a cell in some way that distinguishes it from its neighbors in the shoot tip. The lineage of cells derived by mitosis from the mutant meristematic cell will also be "marked." For example, a single cell in the shoot apical meristem may undergo a somatic mutation that prevents chlorophyll from being produced. This cell and all of its descendants will be "albino," and they will appear as a linear file of colorless cells running down the long axis of the otherwise green shoot. One of the important questions that clonal analysis can address is: How early is the developmental fate of a cell determined by its position in an embryonic structure? To some extent, the developmental fates of cells in the shoot apex are predictable. For example, almost all the cells derived from division of the outermost meristematic cells end up as part of the dermal tissue of leaves and stems. But it is not possible to pinpoint precisely which cells of the meristem will give rise to specific tissues and organs. Apparently random changes in rates and planes of cell division can reorganize the meristem. For example, the outermost cells usually divide in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the shoot tip, resulting in the addition of cells to the surface layer. But occasionally, a cell at the surface divides in a plane parallel to this meristematic layer, placing one daughter cell beneath the surface among cells derived from different lineages. Thus, the cells of the meristem are not dedicated early to forming specific tissues and organs. Put another way, a cell's developmental fate is not determined by its membership in a lineage derived from a particular meristematic cell. Rather, it is the cell's final position in an emerging organ that determines what kind of cell it will become, presumably as a result of positional information.





 Phase changes mark major shifts in development

From what you have learned so far about the shoot apex and primary growth, it would seem as if the meristem lays down an identical repeating pattern of stems and leaves. In fact, the apical meristem can change from one developmental phase to another during its history--a process called a phase change. One of these phase changes is a gradual transition in vegetative (leaf-producing) growth from a juvenile state to a mature state in some species. Usually, the most obvious sign of this phase change is a change in the morphology of the leaves produced. The leaves of juvenile versus mature shoot regions differ in shape and other features (FIGURE 35.34). Once the meristem has laid down juvenile nodes and internodes, they retain that status even as the shoot continues to elongate and the meristem eventually changes to the mature phase. If axillary buds give rise to branches, those shoots reflect the developmental phase of the main shoot region from which they arise. Though the main shoot apex may have made the transition from the juvenile to the mature phase, an older region of the shoot below the apex will continue to give rise to branches bearing juvenile leaves if that shoot region was laid down when the main apex was still in the juvenile phase. Ironically, this means that a branch with juvenile leaves may actually be older than a branch with mature leaves. This is analogous to repairing a vintage automobile with newly manufactured body parts; the parts are new, but they must be of the old style to go with the rest of the car.

Fig 35-34. Phase change in the shoot system of Eucalyptus. A silver-dollar eucalyptus (Eucalyptus polyanthemos) has both (a) juvenile leaves (the round "silver dollars") and (b) mature leaves (the lance-shaped leaves). This dual foliage reflects a phase change in the development of the apical meristem of each shoot. In its juvenile vegetative phase, a meristem lays down modules on which round leaves develop. As the meristem changes gradually to the mature vegetative phase, the leaves become more and more lance-shaped. Once a module forms, its developmental phase--juvenile or mature--is fixed; that is, round leaves do not mature into lanceolate leaves.

The juvenile-to-mature phase transition is another case where it is misleading to compare plant and animal development. In an animal, this transition occurs at the level of the entire organism--as when a larva develops into an adult animal, for example. In plants, phase changes during the history of apical meristems can result in juvenile and mature regions coexisting along the axis of each shoot.





 Genes controlling transcription play key roles in a meristem's change from a vegetative to a floral phase

Another particularly striking passage in plant development is the transition of a vegetative shoot tip into a floral meristem. A combination of environmental cues, such as day length, and internal signals, such as hormones, trigger this transition. (You will learn more about the control of flowering in Chapter 39.) Unlike vegetative growth, which is self-renewing, the production of a flower by an apical meristem terminates primary growth of that shoot tip; the apical meristem is consumed in the production of the flower's organs. The transition from vegetative growth to flowering is associated with the switching on of floral meristem identity genes. The protein products of these genes are transcription factors that in turn help activate the genes required for development of the floral meristem.

Once a shoot meristem is induced to flower, positional information commits each primordium that arises on the flanks of the shoot tip to develop into an organ of specific structure and function--for example, an anther-bearing stamen (see FIGURE 30.13 to review flower structure). Plant biologists have identified some of the genes that are regulated by positional information and that function in this development of floral pattern. Mutations in these organ identity genes substitute one type of floral organ where another would normally form (FIGURE 35.35). For example, a particular mutation may cause an extra whorl of sepals to develop in a flower where there ought to be petals. The inference is that the wild-type alleles for these organ identity genes are responsible for the development of normal floral pattern.

Fig 35-35. Organ identity genes and pattern formation in flower development. (a) Arabidopsis normally has four whorls of flower parts: sepals (Se), petals (Pe), stamens (St), and carpels (Ca). (b) Researchers have identified several mutations of organ identity genes that cause abnormal flowers to develop. This flower has an extra set of petals in place of stamens and an internal flower where normal plants have carpels.

Organ identity genes code for transcription factors (see FIGURE 21.20). Positional information determines which organ identity genes are expressed in a particular floral-organ primordium. The resulting transcription factors probably induce the expression of those genes responsible for building an organ of specific structure and function. FIGURE 35.36 illustrates a hypothesis for how three regulatory products of organ identity genes are responsible for normal flower development. (Chapter 21 explores this hypothesis for flower development in much greater detail--see FIGURE 21.19.) By constructing such hypotheses and designing experiments to test them, researchers are tracing the genetic basis of plant development.

Fig 35-36. The ABC hypothesis for the functioning of organ identity genes in flower development. Based on their studies of mutations that affect floral morphology in Arabidopsis and other plants (a generalized flower is illustrated here), researchers have determined that three classes of organ identity genes are responsible for the spatial pattern of floral organs. (Chapter 21 presents the experimental support for this hypothesis.) The three classes of organ identity genes are designated A, B, and C in the upper drawing, a schematic diagram of a floral meristem in transverse view. The products of these genes are transcription factors that regulate expression of other genes responsible for the development of the specific floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Sepals develop from the region of the meristem where only the A genes are active. Petals develop from the region where both A and B genes are expressed. Stamens arise from the meristem where both the B and C genes are active. And carpels are derived from the region where only the C genes are expressed.

In dissecting the plant to examine its parts, as we have done in this chapter, we must remember that the whole plant functions as an integrated organism. In the following chapters, you will learn more about how materials are transported within the plant (Chapter 36), how plants obtain nutrients (Chapter 37), how plants reproduce (Chapter 38), and how the various functions of the plant are coordinated (Chapter 39). Remembering that structure fits function and that plant anatomy and physiology reflect evolutionary adaptation to the problems of living on land will enhance your understanding of plants.

The algal ancestors of plants were completely immersed in water and dissolved minerals, and none of their cells were far from these ingredients. The evolutionary journey onto land involved the differentiation of the plant body into roots, which absorb water and minerals from soil, and shoots, which are exposed to light and atmospheric CO2. This body plan enabled plants to survive in an environment where chemical resources are divided between two media, soil and air. But the morphological solution to a dual environment posed a new problem: the need to transport materials between roots and shoots, sometimes over long distances. For example, the leaves of the eucalyptus trees in the photograph above are more than 100 m from the roots. These remote organs are bridged by vascular tissues that transport sap throughout the plant body. The mechanisms responsible for this internal transport are the subject of this chapter.

FIGURE 36.1 provides an overview of the major transport processes in whole plants.

 The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue



Water and mineral salts from soil enter the plant through the epidermis of roots, cross the root cortex, pass into the stele, and then flow up xylem vessels to the shoot system. In this section, we focus on the soil  epidermis  root cortex  xylem segments of this transport pathway. Use FIGURE 36.7 to reinforce the key concepts as you read this section.

Minerals are absorbed from the soil solution by the root surface, especially by root hairs and mycorrhizae (symbiotic associations of roots and fungi, not shown in this diagram).

TRANSLOCATION OF PHLOEM SAP

 

 Phloem translocates its sap from sugar sources to sugar sinks



 

 Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms



Xylem sap flows in a direction that generally does not allow it to function in exporting sugar from leaves to other parts of the plant. A second vascular tissue, the phloem, transports the organic products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. This transport of food in the plant is called translocation. In angiosperms, the specialized cells of phloem that function in translocation are the sieve-tube members, which are arranged end to end to form long sieve tubes. Between the cells are sieve plates, porous cross-walls that allow the flow of sap along the sieve tube (see FIGURE 35.9).

Phloem sap is an aqueous solution that differs markedly in composition from xylem sap. By far the prevalent solute in phloem sap is sugar, primarily the disaccharide sucrose in most plant species. The sucrose concentration may be as high as 30%  by weight, giving the sap a syrupy thickness. Phloem sap may also contain minerals, amino acids, and hormones in transit from one part of the plant to another.





 Transport at the cellular level depends on the selective permeability of membranes

The transport of solutes and water across biological membranes was covered in detail in Chapter 8. Here we reexamine a few of these transport processes in the specific context of plant cells.

The selective permeability of a plant cell's plasma membrane controls the movement of solutes between the cell and the extracellular solution. Recall from Chapter 8 that solutes tend to diffuse down their gradients, and when this occurs across a membrane, the process is termed passive transport--passive because it happens without the direct expenditure of metabolic energy by the cell. Most solutes, however, cross a membrane very slowly unless they can pass through transport proteins embedded in the membrane. Some of these facilitate diffusion by binding selectively to a solute on one side of the membrane and releasing the solute on the opposite side. Transfer of the solute across the membrane involves a conformational (shape) change by the transport protein. Other transport proteins function as selective channels, which are simply selective passageways across the membrane. For example, the membranes of most plant cells have potassium channels that allow potassium ions (K+) to pass, but not similar ions, such as sodium (Na+). Some channels are gated;that is, certain environmental or biochemical stimuli can cause the channels to open or close. Later in this chapter, we will see how gated K+ channels in the membranes of guard cells function in the opening and closing of stomata.

Recall also from Chapter 8 that active transport is the pumping of solutes across membranes against their electrochemical gradients, the combined effects of the solute's concentration gradient and the voltage (charge difference) across the membrane. It is termed active because the cell must expend metabolic energy, usually in the form of ATP, to transport a solute "uphill"--that is, counter to the direction in which the solute diffuses. Transport proteins that simply facilitate diffusion, such as selective channels, cannot perform active transport. The active transporters are a special class of membrane proteins, each responsible for pumping specific solutes.





 Proton pumps play a central role in transport across plant membranes

The most important active transporter in the plasma membranes of plant cells is the proton pump, which hydrolyzes ATP and uses the released energy to pump hydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. This results in a proton gradient with a higher H+ concentration outside the cell than inside (FIGURE 36.2a). The gradient is a form of stored energy because the hydrogen ions tend to diffuse "downhill" back into the cell. And because the proton pump moves positive charge, in the form of H+, out of the cell, the pump also generates a membrane potential. Membrane potential is a voltage, a separation of opposite charges across a membrane. Proton pumping makes the inside of a plant cell negative in charge relative to the outside. This voltage is called a membrane potential because the charge separation is a form of potential (stored) energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work.

Fig 36-2. A chemiosmotic model of solute transport in plant cells.

Plant cells use energy stored in the proton gradient and membrane potential to drive the transport of many different solutes. For example, the membrane potential generated by proton pumps contributes to the uptake of potassium ions (K+) by root cells (FIGURE 36.2b). And in the mechanism called cotransport, a transport protein couples the downhill passage of one solute (H+) to the uphill passage of another (NO3-, in the case of FIGURE 36.2c). This "coattail" effect is also responsible for the uptake of the sugar sucrose by plant cells (FIGURE 36.2d). A membrane protein cotransports sucrose with the H+ that is moving down its gradient through the protein.

The role of proton pumps in the transport processes of plant cells is a specific application of the general mechanism called chemiosmosis (see FIGURE 9.15). The key feature of chemiosmosis is a transmembrane proton gradient, which links energy-releasing processes to energy-consuming processes in cells. For example, you learned in Chapters 9 and 10 that mitochondria and chloroplasts use proton gradients generated by electron transport chains (which release energy) to drive ATP synthesis (which consumes energy). The ATP synthases that couple H+ diffusion to ATP synthesis during cellular respiration and photosynthesis function somewhat like the proton pumps in the plasma membranes of plant cells. But in contrast to ATP synthases, proton pumps normally run in reverse, using ATP energy to pump H+ against its gradient. In both cases, proton gradients are the metabolic gears that enable one process to drive another. Chemiosmosis is a unifying principle of cellular energetics.





 Differences in water potential drive water transport in plant cells

The survival of plant cells depends on their ability to balance water uptake and loss. The net uptake or loss of water by a cell occurs by osmosis, the passive transport of water across a membrane (see FIGURE 8.11). How can we predict the direction of osmosis when a cell is surrounded by a particular solution? In the case of an animal cell, it is enough to know whether the extracellular solution is hypotonic (has a lower solute concentration) or hypertonic (has a higher solute concentration) relative to the cell; water will move by osmosis in the hypotonic  hypertonic direction. But in the case of a plant cell, the presence of a cell wall adds a second factor affecting osmosis: physical pressure. The combined effects of these two factors--solute concentration and pressure--are incorporated into a single measurement called water potential, abbreviated by the Greek letter psi (y).

The most important thing for you to learn about water potential is that water will move across a membrane from the solution with the higher water potential to the solution with the lower water potential. For example, if a plant cell is immersed in a solution having a higher water potential than the cell, osmotic uptake of the water will cause the cell to swell. By moving, water can perform work (expanding a cell, for instance). The potential in water potential refers to this potential energy, the capacity to perform work when water moves from a region of higher y to a region of lower y. It is a special case of the general tendency of systems to change spontaneously to a state of lowest free energy (see FIGURE 6.5).

Plant biologists measure y in units of pressure called megapascals (abbreviated MPa), where 1 MPa is equal to about 10 atmospheres of pressure. (An atmosphere is the pressure exerted at sea level by an imaginary column of air--about 1 kg of pressure per square centimeter.) A couple of nonbiological examples will give you some idea of the magnitude of a megapascal: A car tire is usually inflated to a pressure of about 0.2 MPa; the water pressure in home plumbing is about 0.25 MPa.

How Solutes and Pressure Affect Water Potential

Let's see how solute concentration and pressure affect water potential. For purposes of comparison, the water potential of pure water in a container open to the atmosphere is zero (y = 0 MPa). The addition of solutes lowers the water potential. This is because the water molecules that form shells around a solute have less freedom to move than they do in pure water. Because y is standardized as 0 MPa for pure water, any solution at atmospheric pressure has a negative water potential owing to the presence of solutes. For instance, a 0.1-molar (M) solution of any solute has a water potential of -20.23 MPa. If this solution is separated from pure water by a selectively permeable membrane, water will move by osmosis into the solution, from the region of higher y (0 MPa) to the region of lower y (-20.23 MPa). But to predict the direction of water movement, we also have to consider the influence of physical pressure on y.

In contrast to the inverse relationship of y to solute concentration, water potential is directly proportional to pressure; increasing pressure raises y. Remember that y measures the relative tendency for water to leave one location in favor of another. Physical pressure--pressing the plunger of a syringe filled with water, for example--causes water to escape via any available exit. If a solution is separated from pure water by a selectively permeable membrane, external pressure on the solution can counter its tendency to take up water due to the presence of solutes. In fact, even greater pressure will force water across the membrane from the solution to the compartment containing pure water. It is also possible to create a negative pressure, or tension, on water or solutions. For example, if you pull up on the plunger of a syringe, the negative pressure within the syringe draws a solution through the needle.

Quantitative Analysis of Water Potential

The combined effects of pressure and solute concentration on water potential are incorporated into the following equation:  where yP is the pressure potential (physical pressure on a solution) and yS is the solute potential, which is proportional to the solute concentration of a solution. (yS is also called osmotic potential.)

Let's see how this equation works with the help of FIGURE 36.3. A 0.1 M solution has a yS of -20.23 MPa. Thus, in the absence of a physical pressure (yP = 0), water potential, as stated earlier, is -20.23 MPa for a 0.1 M solution:  Water would move into this solution from a compartment of pure water separated from the solution by a selectively permeable membrane (FIGURE 36.3a). But if we now apply a physical pressure of +10.23 MPa to this solution, we raise its water potential from a negative value to 0 MPa (y = 0.23 -0.23). There will now be no net flow of water between this pressurized solution and the compartment of water (FIGURE 36.3b). In fact, if we increase yP to +10.3 MPa, then the solution has a water potential of +10.07 MPa (y = 0.3 - 0.23), and this solution will actually lose water to a compartment containing pure water (FIGURE 36.3c). Finally, imagine using a plunger to pull upward on the water instead of pushing downward on the solution. A negative pressure (tension) of -0.3 MPa on the water compartment would be sufficient to draw water from the solution, which has a water potential of -0.23 MPa (FIGURE 36.3d). In dissecting water potential to see these opposing effects of pressure and solutes, it is important to remember the key point: Water will move across a membrane in the direction of lower (more negative) water potential.

Fig 36-3. Water potential and water movement: a mechanical model. In this U-shaped apparatus, a selectively permeable membrane separates pure water from a 0.1 molar (M) solution containing a particular solute that cannot pass freely across the membrane. Water moves across a selectively permeable membrane from where water potential is higher to where it is lower. The water potential (y) of pure water at atmospheric pressure is 0 MPa. If we know the values of pressure potential (yP) and solute potential (yS), we can calculate water potential: (y = yP + yS). The values for y and yS in the left and right arms of the U-tube are given for initial conditions, before any net movement of water. (a) The addition of solutes reduces water potential (to a negative value). (b, c) Application of physical pressure increases water potential. (d) A negative pressure (tension) decreases water potential.

Let's now apply what we have learned about water potential to the uptake and loss of water by plant cells. First, imagine a flaccid cell, one that has a yP of 0 and is therefore not firm. Let's bathe this flaccid cell in a solution of higher solute concentration than the cell itself (FIGURE 36.4a). Since the external solution has the lower (more negative) water potential, water will leave the cell by osmosis, and the cell will plasmolyze, or shrink and pull away from its wall. Now let's place the same flaccid cell in pure water (y =0; FIGURE 36.4b). The cell has a lower water potential because of the presence of solutes, and water enters the cell by osmosis. The cell begins to swell and push against the wall, producing a turgor pressure. The partially elastic wall pushes back against the pressurized cell. When this wall pressure is great enough to offset the tendency for water to enter because of the solutes in the cell, then yP and yS are equal in magnitude and thus y -0. This matches the water potential of the extracellular environment--in this example, 0 MPa. A dynamic equilibrium has been reached, and there is no further net movement of water, although an equal exchange of water across the membrane continues.

(The protoplasts of flaccid cells are in contact with their walls but lack turgor pressure.) The blue arrows indicate the initial direction of water movement.

In contrast to a flaccid cell, a walled cell that has a greater solute concentration than its surroundings will be turgid, referring to the turgor pressure that keeps it firm. Healthy plant cells are turgid most of the time. Their turgor contributes to support in nonwoody parts of the plant. You can see the consequences of turgor loss in a wilted tomato plant, which has flaccid cells (FIGURE 36.5).

 Aquaporins affect the rate of water transport across membranes

We have been examining water potential as the force that moves water across the membranes of plant cells, but how do the water molecules actually cross the membranes? Because water molecules are so small, they move relatively freely across the lipid bilayer of membranes, even though the middle zone of that bilayer is hydrophobic (see FIGURE 8.1). Until recently, most biologists accepted the hypothesis that leakage of water across the lipid bilayer was enough to account for water fluxes across membranes. That hypothesis was challenged in the early 1990s, when careful measurements indicated that water transport across biological membranes is too specific and too rapid to be explained entirely by diffusion through the lipid bilayer. This observation suggested the possibility of selective channels for water, and such channels have since been discovered in the membranes of both plant and animal cells.

These specific channels for passive traffic of water are transport proteins called aquaporins. Aquaporins do not affect the water potential gradient or the direction of water flow, but rather the rate at which water diffuses down its water potential gradient. The existence of aquaporins raises the possibility that a cell can regulate the rate of water uptake or loss when it has a water potential different from that of its surroundings. Aquaporins may form gated channels that open and close in response to variables such as turgor pressure of the cell. Many laboratories are now investigating how aquaporins work, and this research is likely to increase our understanding of how the cells of plants and other organisms regulate water balance.





 Vacuolated plant cells have three major compartments

Outside the protoplast of a plant cell is a thick cell wall that helps maintain the cell's shape (see FIGURES 7.8 and 35.10). The cell wall itself, however, does not play a direct role in regulating the traffic of molecules into and out of the protoplast; that is the role of the selectively permeable plasma membrane. The plasma membrane serves as a barrier between two major compartments: the cell wall and the cytosol (the part of the cytoplasm contained within the plasma membrane but outside the intracellular organelles). Most mature plant cells have a third major compartment, the vacuole, a large organelle that can occupy as much as 90%  of the protoplast's volume (FIGURE 36.6a). The membrane that bounds the vacuole, the tonoplast, regulates molecular traffic between the cytosol and the vacuolar contents, called cell sap. For example, the tonoplast has proton pumps that expel H+ from the cytosol into the vacuole. This augments the ability of the proton pumps of the plasma membrane to maintain a low cytosolic concentration of H+.

Fig 36-6. Compartments of plant cells and tissues and routes for lateral transport. (a) The cell wall, cytosol, and vacuole are the three main compartments of most mature plant cells. Specific transport proteins embedded in the plasma membrane and tonoplast regulate traffic of molecules between the three compartments. (b) At the tissue level, there are two compartments, the symplast and the apoplast. This anatomy provides three routes for lateral transport in a plant tissue or organ. In this diagram, substances seem confined to one of the three routes; in fact, substances may transfer from one route to another during their commute across an organ.

In most plant tissues, two of the three cellular compartments are continuous from cell to cell. Plasmodesmata connect the cytosolic compartments of neighboring cells, forming a continuous pathway for transport of certain molecules between cells. This cytoplasmic continuum is called the symplast (see FIGURE 36.6). The walls of adjacent plant cells are also in contact, forming a second compartment at the tissue level. This compartment, the continuum of cell walls, is called the apoplast. The third cellular compartment, the vacuole, is not shared with neighboring cells.





 Both the symplast and the apoplast function in transport within tissues and organs

How do water and solutes move from one location to another within plant tissues and organs? For example, what mechanisms transport water and minerals absorbed by a root from the outer cells to the inner cells of the root? Such short-distance transport is sometimes called lateral transport because its usual direction is along the radial axis of plant organs, rather than up and down along the length of the plant.

Three routes are available for lateral transport (FIGURE 36.6b). By the first route, substances move out of one cell, across the cell wall, and into the neighboring cell, which may then pass the substances along to the next cell in the pathway by the same mechanism. This transmembrane route requires repeated crossings of plasma membranes, as the solutes exit one cell and enter the next.

The second route, via the symplast, the continuum of cytosol within a plant tissue, requires only one crossing of a plasma membrane. After entering one cell, solutes and water can then move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata.

The third route for lateral transport within a plant tissue or organ is along the apoplast, the extracellular pathway consisting of cell walls and extracellular spaces. Before ever entering a cell, water and solutes can move from one location to another within a root or other organ along the byways provided by the continuum of cell walls.





 Bulk flow functions in long-distance transport

Diffusion in a solution is fairly efficient for transport over distances of cellular dimensions (less than 100 mm), but it is much too slow to function in long-distance transport within a plant--for example, in the transport of water and minerals from roots to leaves. Water and solutes move through xylem vessels and sieve tubes by bulk flow, the movement of a fluid driven by pressure. In phloem, for example, hydrostatic pressure is generated at one end of a sieve tube, forcing sap to the opposite end of the tube. In xylem, it is actually tension (negative pressure) that drives long-distance transport. Transpiration, the evaporation of water from a leaf, reduces pressure in the leaf xylem. This creates a tension that pulls xylem sap upward from the roots.

If you have ever dealt with a partially clogged drain, you know that the rate of flow through a pipe depends on the pipe's internal diameter. Clogs reduce flow because they reduce the effective diameter of the drainpipe. Such household experiences help us understand how the unusual structures of plant cells specialized for bulk flow--sieve-tube members of the phloem and vessel elements and tracheids of the xylem--fit their function. Recall from Chapter 35 that sieve-tube members are almost entirely devoid of internal organelles and that vessel elements and tracheids are dead at maturity. Like unplugging a kitchen drain, the developmental loss of cytoplasmic content in a plant's "plumbing" allows for the efficient bulk flow of materials through the conduits formed by the specialized cells. The porous plates that connect contiguous sieve-tube members (see FIGURE 35.9) and the perforated end walls of xylem vessel elements (see FIGURE 35.8) also enhance bulk flow.

Now that we have an overview of the basic mechanisms of transport at the cellular, tissue, and whole-plant levels, we are ready to take a closer look at how these mechanisms work together in the overall transport functions that enable a plant to survive on land. For example, bulk flow due to a pressure difference is the mechanism of long-distance transport of phloem sap, but it is active transport of sugar at the cellular level that maintains this pressure difference. The four transport functions we will examine in more detail are the absorption of water and minerals by roots, the ascent of xylem sap, the control of transpiration, and the transport of organic nutrients within phloem.





 Root hairs, mycorrhizae, and a large surface area of cortical cells enhance water and mineral absorption

Much of the absorption of water and minerals occurs near root tips, where the epidermis is permeable to water and where root hairs are located. Root hairs, which are extensions of epidermal cells, account for much of the surface area of roots (see FIGURE 35.14). Soil particles, which are usually coated with water and dissolved minerals, adhere tightly to the hairs. The soil solution flows into the hydrophilic walls of epidermal cells and passes freely along the apoplast into the root cortex. This exposes all the parenchyma cells of the cortex to soil solution, providing a much greater surface area of membrane than the surface area of the epidermis alone.

As the soil solution moves along the apoplast into the roots, cells of the epidermis and cortex take up water and certain solutes into the symplast. The soil solution is usually very dilute, and roots can accumulate essential minerals to concentrations that are hundreds of times higher than the concentrations of these minerals in soil. For example, selective transport proteins of the plasma membrane and tonoplast enable root cells to extract K+, an essential mineral nutrient. In contrast, the cells exclude most Na+, which may be much more concentrated than K+ in the soil solution.

In their essential business of absorbing water and minerals from the soil, most plants are not on their own but have partners in the form of symbiotic fungi. "Infected" roots form mycorrhizae, symbiotic structures consisting of the plant's roots united with the hyphae (filaments) of the fungi (FIGURE 36.8). The hyphae absorb water and selected minerals, transferring much of these resources to the host plant. Chapter 37 highlights the role of mycorrhizae in the mineral nutrition of plants, and Chapter 31 featured the fungal partners in these mutualistic relationships. What is important to understand here is that the mycelium (network of hyphae) of the fungus endows mycorrhizae with an enormous surface area for absorption of water and minerals. As much as 3 m of hyphae can extend from each centimeter along the length of a root, reaching a far greater volume of soil than the root alone could penetrate. Mycorrhizae enable even older regions of roots, far from the abundance of root hairs near the root tips, to supply water and minerals to the plant.

 The endodermis functions as a selective sentry between the root cortex and vascular tissue

Water and minerals that pass from the soil into the root cortex cannot be transported to the rest of the plant until they enter the xylem of the stele. The endodermis, the innermost layer of cells in the root cortex, surrounds the stele and functions as a last checkpoint for the selective passage of minerals from the cortex into the vascular tissue (see FIGURE 36.7). Minerals already in the symplast when they reach the endodermis continue through the plasmodesmata of the endodermal cells and pass into the stele. These minerals were already screened by the selective membrane they had to cross to enter the symplast in the epidermis or cortex. Those minerals that reach the endodermis via the apoplast encounter a dead end that blocks their passage into the stele: In the wall of each endodermal cell is the Casparian strip, a belt made of suberin, a waxy material that is impervious to water and dissolved minerals. Thus, water and minerals cannot cross the endodermis and enter vascular tissue via the apoplast. The only way past this barrier is for the water and minerals to cross the plasma membrane of an endodermal cell and enter the stele via the symplast. The endodermis, with its Casparian strip, ensures that no minerals can reach the vascular tissue of the root without crossing a selectively permeable plasma membrane. If minerals do not enter cells in the cortex, they must enter endodermal cells or be excluded from the vascular tissue. The structure of the endodermis and its strategic location in the root fit its function as sentry of the cortex-stele border, a function that contributes to the ability of roots to preferentially transport certain minerals from the soil into the xylem.

The last segment in the soil  xylem pathway is the passage of water and minerals into the tracheids and vessel elements of the xylem. These water-conducting cells lack protoplasts, and thus the lumen of these cells and the cell walls are part of the apoplast. Endodermal cells as well as parenchyma cells within the stele discharge minerals into their walls. Both diffusion and active transport are probably involved in this transfer of solutes from symplast to apoplast, and the water and minerals are now free to enter the tracheids and xylem vessels. The water and mineral nutrients we have tracked from the soil to root xylem can now be transported upward as xylem sap to the shoot system.





 The ascent of xylem sap depends mainly on transpiration and the physical properties of water

Xylem sap rises against gravity, without the help of any mechanical pump, to reach heights of more than 100 m in the tallest trees. Is the sap pushed upward from the roots, or is it pulled upward from the leaves? Let's evaluate the relative contributions of these two possible mechanisms.

Pushing Xylem Sap: Root Pressure

At night, when transpiration is very low or zero, the root cells are still expending energy to pump mineral ions into the xylem. The endodermis surrounding the stele of the root helps prevent the leakage of these ions back out of the stele. The accumulation of minerals in the stele lowers water potential there. Water flows in from the root cortex, generating a positive pressure that forces fluid up the xylem. This upward push of xylem sap is called root pressure.

Root pressure causes guttation, the exudation of water droplets that can be seen in the morning on tips of grass blades or the leaf margins of some small, herbaceous (nonwoody) dicots. During the night, when the rate of transpiration is low, the roots of some plants keep accumulating minerals, and root pressure pushes xylem sap into the shoot system. More water enters leaves than is transpired, and the excess is forced out as guttation fluid (FIGURE 36.9).

Fig 36-9. Guttation. Root pressure is forcing excess water from this strawberry leaf.

In most plants, root pressure is not the major mechanism driving the ascent of xylem sap. At most, root pressure can force water upward only a few meters, and many plants generate no root pressure at all. Even in plants that display guttation, root pressure cannot keep pace with transpiration after sunrise. For the most part, xylem sap is not pushed from below by root pressure but pulled upward by the leaves themselves.

Pulling Xylem Sap: The Transpiration-Cohesion-Tension Mechanism

If we want to move solid material upward, we can either push it from below or pull it from above. It is less obvious that something as seemingly fluid as water could be pulled up a pipe. Nevertheless, that is what happens in the xylem vessels of plants. As we investigate this mechanism of transport, we will see that transpiration provides the pull, and the cohesion of water due to hydrogen bonding transmits the upward pull along the entire length of the xylem to the roots.

Transpirational Pull.Stomata, the microscopic pores on the surface of a leaf, lead to a maze of internal air spaces that expose the mesophyll cells to the carbon dioxide they need for photosynthesis. The air in these spaces is saturated with water vapor because it is in contact with the moist walls of the cells. On most days, the air outside the leaf is drier; that is, it has a lower water concentration than the air inside the leaf. Therefore, gaseous water, diffusing down its concentration gradient, exits the leaf via the stomata. It is this loss of water vapor from the leaf that we call transpiration.

How is transpiration translated into a pulling force for the movement of water in a plant? The mechanism depends on the generation of a negative pressure (tension) in the leaf due to the unique physical properties of water. Evaporation from the thin film of water that coats the mesophyll cells replaces the water vapor that is lost from the leaf's air spaces by transpiration. As water evaporates, the remaining film of liquid water retreats into the pores of the cell walls, attracted by adhesion to the hydrophilic walls (FIGURE 36.10). At the same time, cohesive forces in the water resist an increase in the surface area of the film (a surface-tension effect; see Chapter 3). The combination of the two forces acting on the water -- adhesion to the wall and surface tension -- causes the surface of the water film to form a meniscus, or concave shape. In a sense, the water is being "pulled on" by the adhesive and cohesive forces. Thus, the water film at the surface of leaf cells has a negative pressure, a pressure less than atmospheric pressure. And the more concave the meniscus, the more negative the pressure of the water film. This negative pressure, or tension, is the pulling force that draws water out of the leaf xylem, through the mesophyll, and toward the cells and surface film bordering the air spaces near stomata.

Fig 36-10. The generation of transpirational pull in a leaf. Water vapor diffuses from the moist air spaces of the leaf to the drier air outside via stomata. Evaporation from the water film coating the mesophyll cells maintains the high humidity of the air spaces. This loss of water causes the water film to form menisci that become more and more concave as the rate of transpiration increases. A meniscus has a tension that is inversely proportional to the radius of the curved water surface. Thus, as the water film recedes and its menisci become more concave, the tension of the water film increases. Tension is a negative pressure--a force that pulls water from locations where hydrostatic pressure is greater. The tension of water lining the air spaces of the leaf is the physical basis of transpirational pull, which draws water out of xylem.

This mechanism of water flow fits with what you learned earlier about water potential. In the equation for water potential, a tension (negative pressure) lowers the potential. And since water moves from where its potential is higher to where it is lower, mesophyll cells will lose water to the surface film lining air spaces, which in turn loses water by transpiration. The water lost via the stomata is replaced by water that is pulled out of the leaf xylem. The negative water potential of leaves provides the "pull" in transpirational pull.

Cohesion and Adhesion in the Ascent of Xylem Sap.The transpirational pull on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips and even into the soil solution (FIGURE 36.11). The cohesion of water due to hydrogen bonding makes it possible to pull a column of sap from above without the water separating. Water molecules exiting the xylem in the leaf tug on adjacent water molecules, and this pull is relayed, molecule by molecule, down the entire column of water in the xylem. Also helping to fight gravity is the strong adhesion of water molecules (again by hydrogen bonds) to the hydrophilic walls of the xylem cells. The very small diameter of tracheids and vessel elements exposes a large proportion of the water to the hydrophilic walls, thus enhancing adhesion in overcoming the downward force of gravity.

Fig 36-11. Ascent of water in a tree. Hydrogen bonding forms an unbroken chain of water molecules extending from leaves all the way to the soil. The force that drives the ascent of xylem sap is a gradient of water potential (y). For the bulk flow over long distance, the y gradient is due mainly to a gradient of the pressure potential (yP). Transpiration results in the yP at the leaf end of xylem being lower than the yP at the root end.

The upward pull on the cohesive sap creates tension within the xylem. Pressure will cause an elastic pipe to swell, but tension will pull the walls of the pipe inward. You can actually measure a decrease in the diameter of a tree trunk on a warm day, when transpirational pull puts the xylem under tension. The rings of secondary walls prevent xylem vessels from collapsing, much as wire rings maintain the shape of a vacuum hose. Transpirational pull puts the xylem under tension all the way down to the root tips, even in the tallest trees. This tension lowers water potential in the root xylem to such an extent that water flows passively from the soil, across the root cortex, and into the stele.

Transpirational pull can extend down to the roots only through an unbroken chain of water molecules. Cavitation, the formation of a water vapor pocket in a xylem vessel, such as when xylem sap freezes in winter, breaks the chain. Small plants can use root pressure to refill xylem vessels in spring, but in trees, root pressure cannot push water to the top, so a vessel with a water vapor pocket can never function as a water pipe again. However, the transpiration stream can detour around the water vapor pocket through pits between adjacent xylem vessels, and secondary growth adds a layer of new xylem vessels each year. In some angiosperm trees, including oaks and elms, the youngest, outermost growth ring of xylem transports most of the water. The older xylem functions to support the tree (see Chapter 35).





 Xylem sap ascends by solar-powered bulk flow: a review

The transpiration-cohesion-tension mechanism that transports xylem sap against gravity is an excellent example of how physical principles apply to biological problems. Long-distance transport of water from roots to leaves occurs by bulk flow, the movement of fluid driven by a pressure difference at opposite ends of a conduit. In a plant, the conduits are xylem vessels or chains of tracheids. The pressure difference is generated at the leaf end by transpirational pull, which lowers pressure (increases tension) at the "upstream" end of the xylem.

On a smaller scale, gradients of water potential drive the osmotic movement of water from cell to cell within root and leaf tissue (see FIGURE 36.11). Differences in both solute concentration and pressure contribute to this microscopic transport. In contrast, bulk flow, the mechanism for long-distance transport up xylem vessels, depends only on pressure. Another contrast with osmosis, which moves only water, is that bulk flow moves the whole solution, water plus minerals and any other solutes dissolved in the water.

The plant expends none of its own metabolic energy to lift xylem sap up to the leaves by bulk flow. The absorption of sunlight drives transpiration by causing water to evaporate from the moist walls of mesophyll cells and by maintaining a high humidity in the air spaces within a leaf. Thus, the ascent of xylem sap is ultimately solar powered.





 Guard cells mediate the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise

A leaf may transpire more than its weight in water each day. Leaves are kept from wilting by a transpiration stream in xylem vessels that flows as fast as 75 cm/min, about the speed of the tip of a second hand sweeping around a wall clock. A plant's tremendous requirement for water is part of the cost of making food by photosynthesis. Guard cells, by controlling the size of stomata, help balance the plant's need to conserve water with its requirement for photosynthesis (FIGURE 36.12).

The Photosynthesis-Transpiration Compromise

To make food, a plant must spread its leaves to the sun and obtain CO2 from the air. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaf through the stomata, and oxygen produced as a by-product of photosynthesis diffuses out of the leaf via the stomata (see FIGURE 36.10). Upon diffusing through the stomata, CO2 enters a honeycomb of air spaces formed by the irregularly shaped spongy parenchyma cells (see FIGURE 35.11). Because of the irregular shape of these cells, the internal surface area of the leaf may be 10 to 30 times greater than the external surface area we see when we look at the leaf. This structural feature of leaves supports photosynthesis by increasing exposure to CO2, but it also increases the surface area for the evaporation of water, which exits the plant freely through open stomata. About 90%  of the water a plant loses escapes through stomata, though these pores account for only 1-2%  of the external leaf surface. The waxy cuticle limits water loss through the remaining surface of the leaf.

One way to evaluate how efficiently a plant uses water is to determine its transpiration-to-photosynthesis ratio, the amount of water lost per gram of CO2 assimilated into organic material by photosynthesis. For many plant species, this ratio is about 600:1, meaning the plant transpires 600 g of water for each gram of CO2 that becomes incorporated into carbohydrate. However, corn and other plants that assimilate atmospheric CO2 by the C4 pathway have transpiration-to-photosynthesis ratios of 300:1 or less. With the same concentration of CO2 within the air spaces of the leaf, C4 plants can assimilate that CO2 at a greater rate than C3 plants can (see Chapter 10). Because water loss is the trade-off for allowing CO2 to diffuse into the leaf, the photosynthetic return for each gram of water sacrificed is greater for C4 plants, which can assimilate CO2 faster than C3 plants when stomata are partially closed.

In addition to supplying water to leaves, the transpiration stream assists in the delivery of minerals and other substances from the roots to the shoots and leaves. Transpiration also results in evaporative cooling, which can lower the temperature of a leaf by as much as 10-15&#176;C compared with the surrounding air. This prevents the leaf from reaching temperatures that could denature various enzymes involved in photosynthesis and other metabolic processes. Cacti and other desert succulents, which have low rates of transpiration, can tolerate high leaf temperatures; in this case, the loss of water due to transpiration is a greater threat than overheating.

When transpiration exceeds the delivery of water by xylem, as when the soil begins to dry out, the leaves begin to wilt as their cells lose turgor pressure (see FIGURE 36.5). The potential rate of transpiration will be greatest on a day that is sunny, warm, dry, and windy, because these are the environmental factors that increase the evaporation of water. Plants are not helpless against the elements, however, for they are capable of adjusting to their environment. In the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise, mechanisms that regulate the size of the stomatal openings strike a balance.

How Stomata Open and Close

Each stoma is flanked by a pair of guard cells, which are kidney-shaped in dicots and dumbbell-shaped in monocots. The guard cells are suspended by their epidermal neighbors over an air chamber, which leads to a honeycomb of air spaces.

Guard cells control the diameter of the stoma by changing shape, thereby widening or narrowing the gap between the two cells (FIGURE 36.13a). When guard cells take in water by osmosis, they become more turgid and swell. In most dicots, the cell walls of guard cells are not uniformly thick, and the cellulose microfibrils are oriented in a direction that causes the guard cells to buckle outward when they are turgid. This increases the size of the gap between the cells. When the cells lose water and become flaccid, they become less bowed and close the space between them. This basic mechanism also applies to the stomata of monocots.

Guard cells of a dicot are illustrated in their turgid (stoma open) and flaccid (stoma closed) states. The pair of guard cells buckle outward when turgid. Cellulose microfibrils in the walls resist stretching and compression in the direction parallel to the microfibrils. Thus, the radial orientation of the microfibrils causes the cells to increase in length more than width when turgor increases. The two guard cells are attached at their tips, so the increase in length causes buckling. (b) Role of potassium in stomatal opening and closing. The transport of K+ (potassium ions) across the plasma membrane and tonoplast causes the turgor changes of guard cells. Stomata open when guard cells accumulate potassium (red dots), which lowers the cells' water potential and causes them to take up water by osmosis. The cells become turgid. An exodus of K+ from guard cells causes stomatal closure.

The changes in turgor pressure that open and close stomata result primarily from the reversible uptake and loss of potassium ions (K+) by the guard cells. Stomata open when guard cells actively accumulate K+ from neighboring epidermal cells (FIGURE 36.13b). This uptake of solute causes the water potential to become more negative within the guard cells, and the cells become more turgid as water enters by osmosis. Most of the K+ and water are stored in the vacuole, and thus the tonoplast also plays a role. Stomatal closing results from an exodus of K+ from guard cells, which leads to an osmotic loss of water. Regulation of aquaporins may also be involved in the swelling and shrinking of guard cells by varying the permeability of the membranes to water.

The K+ fluxes across the guard cell membrane are probably passive, being coupled to the generation of membrane potentials by proton pumps. Stomatal opening correlates with active transport of H+ out of the guard cell. The resulting voltage (membrane potential) drives K+ into the cell through specific membrane channels (see FIGURE 36.2). Plant physiologists are using a method called patch clamping to study regulation of the guard cell's proton pumps and K+ channels (FIGURE 36.14).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 36-14. A patch-clamp study of guard cell membranes. Patch clamping makes it possible to isolate a very tiny "patch" of membrane and study ion movement through a single type of channel--K+ or H+ channels, for instance. This particular experiment measures the effect of blue light, which increases H+ current across the membrane. Along with other evidence, patch-clamp studies support the hypothesis that blue light and other stimuli regulate guard cells by affecting the proton (H+) pumps of the membrane.

In general, stomata are open during the day and closed at night. This prevents the plant from needlessly losing water when it is too dark for photosynthesis. At least three cues contribute to stomatal opening at dawn. First, light itself stimulates guard cells to accumulate potassium and become turgid. This response is triggered by the illumination of a blue-light receptor in a guard cell, perhaps built into the plasma membrane. Activation of these blue-light receptors stimulates the activity of ATP-powered proton pumps in the plasma membrane of the guard cells, which in turn promotes the uptake of K+ (see FIGURE 36.14). Light may also stimulate stomatal opening by driving photosynthesis in guard cell chloroplasts, making ATP available for the active transport of hydrogen ions. (Guard cells are the only epidermal cells equipped with chloroplasts.)

A second stimulus causing stomata to open is depletion of CO2 within air spaces of the leaf, which occurs when photosynthesis begins in the mesophyll. We can actually trick a plant into opening its stomata at night by placing it in a chamber devoid of CO2.

A third cue in stomatal opening is an internal clock located in the guard cells. Even if you keep a plant in a dark closet, stomata will continue their daily rhythm of opening and closing. All eukaryotic organisms have internal clocks that somehow keep track of time and regulate cyclic processes. Cycles that have intervals of approximately 24 hours are called circadian rhythms. You will learn more about circadian rhythms and the biological clocks that control them in Chapter 39.

Environmental stresses of various kinds can cause stomata to close during the daytime. When the plant is suffering a water deficiency, guard cells may lose turgor. In addition, a hormone called abscisic acid, which is produced in the mesophyll cells in response to water deficiency, signals guard cells to close stomata. This response reduces further wilting, but it also slows down photosynthesis; this is one reason droughts reduce crop yields. High temperatures also induce stomatal closure, probably by stimulating cellular respiration and increasing CO2 concentration within the air spaces of the leaf. High temperature and excessive transpiration may combine to cause stomata to close briefly during mid-day. Thus, guard cells arbitrate the photosynthesis-transpiration compromise on a moment-to-moment basis by integrating a variety of internal and external stimuli.





 Xerophytes have evolutionary adaptations that reduce transpiration

Plants adapted to arid climates, called xerophytes, have various leaf modifications that reduce the rate of transpiration. Many xerophytes have small, thick leaves, an adaptation that limits water loss by reducing surface area relative to leaf volume. A thick cuticle gives some of these leaves a leathery consistency. The stomata are concentrated on the lower (shady) leaf surface, and they are often located in depressions that shelter the pores from the dry wind (FIGURE 36.15). During the driest months, some desert plants shed their leaves. Others, such as cacti, subsist on water the plant stores in its fleshy stems during the rainy season. (These modified stems are the photosynthetic organs of cacti; the spines are modified leaves.)

Fig 36-15. Structural adaptations of a xerophyte leaf. Oleander (inset) is commonly planted along desert highways. The leaves have a thick cuticle and multiple-layered dermal tissue that reduce water loss. Stomata are recessed in "crypts," an adaptation that reduces the rate of transpiration by protecting the stomata from hot, dry wind. The trichomes ("hairs") also help minimize transpiration by breaking up the flow of air, allowing the chamber of the crypt to have a higher humidity than the surrounding atmosphere (LM).

One of the most elegant adaptations to arid habitats is found in ice plants and other succulent plants of the family Crassulaceae and in representatives of many other plant families. These plants assimilate CO2 by an alternative photosynthetic pathway known as CAM, for crassulacean acid metabolism (see FIGURE 10.19). Mesophyll cells in a CAM plant have enzymes that can incorporate CO2 into organic acids during the night. During the daytime, the organic acids are broken down to release CO2 in the same cells, and sugars are synthesized by the conventional (C3) photosynthetic pathway. Because the leaf takes in its CO2 at night, the stomata can close during the day, when transpiration is most severe.





 Phloem translocates its sap from sugar sources to sugar sinks

In contrast to the unidirectional transport of xylem sap from roots to leaves, the direction that phloem sap travels is variable. The one generalization that holds is that sieve tubes carry food from a sugar source to a sugar sink. A sugar source is a plant organ in which sugar is being produced by either photosynthesis or the breakdown of starch. Mature leaves are the primary sugar sources. A sugar sink is an organ that is a net consumer or storer of sugar. Growing roots, shoot tips, stems, and fruit are sugar sinks supplied by phloem. A storage organ, such as a tuber or a bulb, may be either a source or a sink, depending on the season. When the storage organ is stockpiling carbohydrates during the summer, it is a sugar sink. After breaking dormancy in the early spring, however, the storage organ becomes a source as its starch is broken down to sugar, which is carried away in the phloem to the growing buds of the shoot system.

Other solutes may be transported to sinks along with sugar. For example, minerals that reach leaves in xylem may later be transferred in the phloem to developing fruit.

A sugar sink usually receives its sugar from the sources nearest to it. The upper leaves on a branch may send sugar to the growing shoot tip, whereas the lower leaves on the same branch export sugar to roots. A growing fruit requires so much food that it may monopolize the sugar sources all around it. One sieve tube in a vascular bundle may carry phloem sap in one direction while sap in a different tube in the same bundle flows in the opposite direction. For each sieve tube, the direction of transport depends only on the locations of the source and sink connected by that tube. This direction may change with the season or developmental stage of the plant.

Sugar from the mesophyll cells of a leaf and other sources must be loaded into sieve-tube members before it can be exported to sugar sinks. In some species, sucrose moves all the way from mesophyll cells to sieve-tube members via the symplast, passing from cell to cell through plasmodesmata. In other species, sucrose reaches sieve-tube members by a combination of symplastic and apoplastic pathways (FIGURE 36.16a). For example, in corn leaves, sucrose diffuses through the symplast from mesophyll cells into small veins. Much of the sugar then moves out of the cells into the apoplast (walls) in the vicinity of sieve-tube members and companion cells. This sucrose is accumulated from the apoplast (walls) directly by the sieve-tube members or by their companion cells. Companion cells pass the sugar they accumulate into the sieve-tube members through plasmodesmata linking the cells. In some plants, companion cells have numerous ingrowths of their walls, an adaptation that increases the cells' surface area and enhances the transfer of solutes between apoplast and symplast. Such modified cells are called transfer cells (see FIGURE 29.5).

Fig 36-16. Loading of sucrose into phloem.

In corn and many other plants, sieve-tube members accumulate sucrose to concentrations two to three times higher than concentrations in mesophyll, and thus phloem loading requires active transport. Proton pumps do the work that enables the cells to accumulate sucrose (FIGURE 36.16b).

Downstream, at the sink end of a sieve tube, phloem unloads its sucrose. Phloem unloading is a highly variable process; its mechanism depends on the plant species and the type of organ. Regardless of its exact mechanism, the concentration of free sugar in the sink is lower than that in the sieve tube because the unloaded sugar is either consumed during growth and metabolism of the sink cells or is converted into insoluble polymers such as starch. As a result of this sugar concentration gradient, sugar molecules diffuse from the phloem into the sink tissues, and water follows by osmosis.





 Pressure flow is the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms

Phloem sap flows from source to sink at rates as great as 1 m/hr, which is much too fast to be accounted for by either diffusion or cytoplasmic streaming. Phloem sap moves by bulk flow, which is driven by pressure (thus the synonym pressure flow). Phloem loading results in a high solute concentration at the source end of a sieve tube, which lowers the water potential and causes water to flow into the tube (FIGURE 36.17, p. 764). Hydrostatic pressure develops within the sieve tube, and the pressure is greatest at the source end of the tube. At the sink end, the pressure is relieved by the loss of water, owing to water potential being lowered outside the sieve tube by the exodus of sucrose. The building of pressure at one end of the tube (source) and reduction of that pressure at the opposite end (sink) cause water to flow from source to sink, carrying the sugar along. Water is recycled back from sink to source by xylem vessels.

The pressure flow model explains why phloem sap always flows from a sugar source to a sugar sink, regardless of their locations in the plant. Researchers have devised several kinds of experiments to test the model. FIGURE 36.18 illustrates an innovative experiment that takes advantage of natural phloem probes: aphids that feed on phloem sap. The case for pressure flow as the mechanism of translocation in angiosperms is convincing. It is not yet known, however, if this model applies to other vascular plants.

Fig 36-18. Tapping phloem sap with the help of an aphid. (a) The "honey-dew" droplet exuded from the anus of this aphid consists of phloem sap minus some nutrients absorbed by the insect. (b) The aphid inserts a modified mouthpart called a stylet into the plant and probes until the tip of this hypodermic-like organ penetrates a single sieve-tube member (LM). The pressure within the sieve tube force-feeds the aphid, swelling it to several times its original size. (c) While the aphid is feeding, it can be anesthetized and severed from its stylet, which then serves the researcher as a miniature tap that exudes phloem sap for hours. The closer the stylet is to a sugar source, the faster the sap will flow out and the greater its sugar concentration. These results are predicted by the pressure flow hypothesis.

In our study of how sugar moves in plants, we have seen examples of plant transport on three levels: at the cellular level of transport across plasma membranes (sucrose accumulation by active transport in phloem cells); at the short-distance level of lateral transport within organs (sucrose migration from mesophyll to phloem via the symplast and apoplast); and at the long-distance level of transport between organs (bulk flow within sieve tubes). An increased understanding of these transport processes will be central to agricultural advancement in the future. Consider the fact that it is not photosynthesis that limits yield in a plant growing under ideal conditions, but the ability of the plant to transport sugar away from the leaf. Thus, the genetic engineering of higher-yielding crop plants may depend on gaining a better understanding of the factors that limit the bulk flow of sugars through the phloem.

Plant physiologists still have much to learn about the mechanisms of transport in the vascular systems of xylem and phloem. William Harvey, the great 17th-century physiologist, speculated that plants and animals have similar circulatory systems. The idea was abandoned after careful dissection failed to turn up a heart in plants. We are only now beginning to understand how a plant keeps sap flowing through its veins without the help of moving parts.

Every organism is an open system connected to its environment by a continuous exchange of energy and materials. In the energy flow and chemical cycling that keep an ecosystem alive, plants and other photosynthetic autotrophs perform the key step of transforming inorganic compounds into organic ones. Autotrophic does not mean autonomous, however. Plants need sunlight as the energy source for photosynthesis. And to synthesize organic matter, plants also require raw materials in the form of inorganic substances: carbon dioxide, water, and a variety of minerals present as inorganic ions in the soil. With its ramifying root system and shoot system (see the photograph of a hyacinth above), a plant is extensively networked with its environment--the soil and air, which are the reservoirs of the plant's inorganic nutrients. In this chapter, you will learn more about the nutritional requirements of plants and examine some of the structural and physiological adaptations for plant nutrition that have evolved.

Of all mineral elements, nitrogen is the one that most often limits the growth of plants and the yields of crops. Plants require nitrogen as an ingredient of proteins, nucleic acids, and other important organic molecules.

The roots of plants belong to subterranean communities that include a diversity of other organisms. Among those organisms are certain species of bacteria and fungi that have coevolved with specific plants, forming symbiotic relationships with roots that enhance the nutrition of both partners. The two most important examples are symbiotic nitrogen fixation (roots and bacteria) and the formation of mycorrhizae (roots and fungi).

 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals



Symbiotic nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae underscore the relationship between plants and their environment, which includes the other organisms that interact with plants. We conclude this chapter by exploring predation and parasitism as two other types of plant adaptations that enhance nutrition through interactions with other organisms.





 The chemical composition of plants provides clues to their nutritional requirements

Watch a large plant grow from a tiny seed, and you cannot help wondering where all the mass comes from. Aristotle thought that soil provided the substance for plant growth, because plants seemed to spring from the ground. Leaves, he believed, functioned only to shade the developing fruit. In the 17th century, a Belgian physician named Jean-Baptiste van Helmont performed an experiment to test the hypothesis that plants grow by absorbing soil. He planted a willow seedling in a pot that contained 90.9 kg of soil. After five years, the willow had grown into a tree weighing 76.8 kg, but only 0.06 kg of soil had disappeared from the pot. Van Helmont concluded that the willow had grown mainly from the water he had added regularly. A century later, Stephen Hales, an English physiologist, postulated that plants are nourished mostly by air.

As it turns out, none of the early ideas about plant nutrition is entirely incorrect. Plants do extract minerals from the soil. Mineral nutrients are essential chemical elements absorbed from the soil in the form of inorganic ions. For example, plants need nitrogen, which they acquire from the soil mainly in the form of nitrate ions (NO3-). However, as we can conclude from van Helmont's data, mineral nutrients from the soil make only a small contribution to the overall mass of the plant. About 80-85%  of a herbaceous (nonwoody) plant is water, and plants grow mainly by accumulating water in the central vacuoles of their cells. Furthermore, water can truly be considered a nutrient because it supplies most of the hydrogen atoms and some of the oxygen atoms that are incorporated into organic compounds by photosynthesis (see FIGURE 10.3). However, only a small fraction of the water that enters a plant contributes atoms to organic molecules. Generally, more than 90%  of the water absorbed by plants is lost by transpiration, and most of the water retained by the plant functions as a solvent, provides most of the mass for cell elongation, and helps maintain the form of soft tissue by keeping cells turgid. By weight, the bulk of the organic material of a plant is derived not from water or soil minerals, but from the CO2 assimilated from the atmosphere (FIGURE 37.1).

Fig 37-1. The uptake of nutrients by a plant: an overview. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil, with mycorrhizae and root hairs greatly increasing surface area for absorption. Carbon dioxide, the source of carbon for photo-synthesis, diffuses into leaves from the sur-rounding air through stomata. (Plants also need O2 for cellular respiration, although the plant is a net producer of O2.) From these inorganic nutrients the plant can produce all of its own organic material.

We can measure water content by comparing the weight of plant material before and after it is dried. We can then analyze the chemical composition of the dry residue. Organic substances account for about 95%  of the dry weight, with inorganic substances making up the remaining 5% . Most of the organic material is carbohydrate, including the cellulose of cell walls. Thus, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, the ingredients of carbohydrates, are the most abundant elements in the dry weight of a plant. Because some organic molecules contain nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus, these elements are also relatively abundant in plants.

More than 50 chemical elements have been identified among the inorganic substances present in plants, but it is unlikely that all these elements are essential. Roots are able to absorb minerals somewhat selectively, enabling the plant to accumulate essential elements that may be present in the soil in very minute quantities. To a certain extent, however, the minerals in a plant reflect the composition of the soil in which the plant is growing. Plants growing on mine tailings, for instance, may contain gold or silver. Studying the chemical composition of plants provides clues about their nutritional requirements, but we must distinguish elements that are essential from those that are merely present in the plant.





 Plants require nine macronutrients and at least eight micronutrients

A particular chemical element is considered an essential nutrient if it is required for a plant to grow from a seed and complete the life cycle, producing another generation of seeds. Researchers can use a method known as hydroponic culture to determine which of the mineral elements are actually essential nutrients (FIGURE 37.2). Such studies have helped identify 17 elements that are essential nutrients in all plants and a few other elements that are essential to certain groups of plants. Most research has involved crop plants; little is known about the specific nutritional needs of uncultivated plants, even some of the most commercially important conifers that provide lumber.

Fig 37-2. Using hydroponic culture to identify essential nutrients. A researcher bathes the roots of plants in solutions of various minerals dissolved in known concentrations. Aerating the water provides the roots with oxygen for cellular respiration. A particular mineral, such as potassium, can be omitted from the culture medium to test whether it is essential to the plants. If the element deleted from the mineral solution is an essential nutrient, then the incomplete medium will cause plants to become abnormal in appear-ance compared with controls grown on a complete mineral medium. The most common symptoms of a mineral deficiency are stunted growth and discolored leaves.

Elements required by plants in relatively large amounts are called macronutrients. There are nine macronutrients in all, including the six major ingredients of organic compounds: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The other three macronutrients are potassium, calcium, and magnesium. (TABLE 37.1 lists some of their functions.)

The eight micronutrients are iron, chlorine, copper, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, boron, and nickel. These elements function in plants mainly as cofactors of enzymatic reactions (see Chapter 6). Iron, for example, is a metallic component of cytochromes, the proteins that function in the electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is because micronutrients generally play catalytic roles that plants need only minute quantities of these elements. The requirement for molybdenum, for example, is so modest that there is only one atom of this rare element for every 16 million atoms of hydrogen in dried plant material. Yet a deficiency of molybdenum or any other micronutrient can weaken or kill a plant.





 The symptoms of a mineral deficiency depend on the function and mobility of the element

The symptoms of a mineral deficiency depend partly on the function of that nutrient in the plant. For example, a deficiency of magnesium, an ingredient of chlorophyll, causes yellowing of the leaves, or chlorosis (FIGURE 37.3). In some cases, the relationship between a mineral deficiency and its symptoms is less direct. For instance, iron deficiency can cause chlorosis even though chlorophyll contains no iron, because this metal is required as a cofactor in one of the steps of chlorophyll synthesis.

Fig 37-3. Magnesium deficiency in a tomato plant. Yellowing of the leaves (chlorosis) is the result of an inability to synthesize chlorophyll, which contains magnesium.

Mineral deficiency symptoms depend not only on the role of the nutrient in the plant but also on its mobility within the plant. If a nutrient moves about freely from one part of the plant to another, symptoms of a deficiency will show up first in older organs. This is because young, growing tissues have more "drawing power" than old tissues for nutrients that are in short supply. (The mechanism for this preferential routing is the source-to-sink translocation in phloem that you learned about in Chapter 36.) A plant starved for magnesium, for example, will show signs of chlorosis first in its older leaves. Magnesium, which is relatively mobile in the plant, is shunted preferentially to young leaves. In contrast, a deficiency of a nutrient that is relatively immobile within a plant will affect young parts of the plant first. Older tissues may have adequate amounts of the mineral, which they are able to retain during periods of short supply. For example, iron does not move freely within a plant, and a deficiency of iron will cause yellowing of young leaves before any effect on older leaves is visible.

The symptoms of a mineral deficiency are often distinctive enough for a plant physiologist or farmer to diagnose its cause. One way to confirm the diagnosis of a specific deficiency is to analyze the mineral content of the plant and soil. Deficiencies of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus are the most common problems. Shortages of micronutrients are less common and tend to be geographically localized because of differences in soil composition. The amount of a micronutrient needed to correct a deficiency is usually quite small. For example, a zinc deficiency in fruit trees can usually be cured by hammering a few zinc nails into each tree trunk. Moderation is important because overdoses of some micronutrients can be toxic to plants.

One way to ensure optimal mineral nutrition is to grow plants hydroponically on nutrient solutions that can be precisely regulated (FIGURE 37.4). Hydroponics is currently practiced commercially, but only on a limited scale, because the requirements for equipment and labor make hydroponic farming relatively expensive compared with growing crops in soil.

Fig 37-4. Hydroponic farming. In this apparatus, a nutrient solution flows over the roots of lettuce growing on a slat. Perhaps astronauts living in a space station will one day grow their vegetables hydroponically, but because of the expense, it is unlikely that this type of farming will relieve hunger here on Earth.

Mineral deficiencies are not limited to terrestrial ecosystems, nor are they unique to plants among photosynthetic organisms. Vast "pastures" of algae in the world's southern oceans are capable of explosive blooms, restrained only by deficiencies of iron in the seawater. In a limited trial in the relatively unproductive seas between Tasmania and Antarctica, researchers demonstrated that dispersing small amounts of iron produces large algal blooms that pull carbon dioxide out of the air. Seeding the ocean with iron might help slow the increase in global carbon dioxide levels that has occurred because of our burning of fossil fuels (and which contributes to global warming by the greenhouse effect; see Chapter 54). Despite the possible benefits, widespread adoption of iron fertilization must be approached warily, given the many uncertain ecological and climatological effects it could have.





 Soil characteristics are key environmental factors in terrestrial ecosystems

The texture and chemical composition of soil are major factors determining what kinds of plants can grow well in a particular location, be it a natural ecosystem or an agricultural region. (Climate, of course, is another important factor.) Plants that grow naturally in a certain type of soil are adapted to its mineral content and texture and are able to absorb water and extract essential nutrients from that soil. In interacting with the soil that supports their growth, plants, in turn, affect the soil, as we will soon see. The soil-plant interface is a critical component of the chemical cycles that sustain terrestrial ecosystems.

Texture and Composition of Soils

Soil has its origin in the weathering of solid rock. Water that seeps into crevices and freezes in winter fractures the rock, and acids dissolved in the water also help to break down the rock. Once organisms are able to invade the rock, they accelerate the breakdown. Lichens, fungi, bacteria, mosses, and the roots of vascular plants all secrete acids, and the expansion of roots growing in fissures cracks rocks and pebbles. The eventual result of all this activity is topsoil, a mixture of particles derived from rock, living organisms, and humus, a residue of partially decayed organic material. The topsoil and other distinct soil layers, or horizons, are often visible in vertical profile where there is a roadcut or deep hole (FIGURE 37.5).

Fig 37-5. Soil horizons. This researcher is photographing a vertical profile of three soil layers, or horizons, in a Tennessee cotton field.

The texture of topsoil depends on the size of its particles, which are classified in a range from coarse sand to microscopic clay particles. The most fertile soils are usually loams, made up of roughly equal amounts of sand, silt (particles of intermediate size), and clay. Loamy soils have enough fine particles to provide a large surface area for retaining minerals and water, which adhere to the particles. But loams also have enough coarse particles to provide air spaces containing oxygen that can be used by roots for cellular respiration. If soil does not drain adequately, roots suffocate because the air spaces are replaced by water; the roots may also be attacked by molds favored by the soaked soil. These are common hazards for houseplants that are overwatered in pots with poor drainage. Some plants, however, are adapted to waterlogged soil. For example, mangroves that inhabit swamps and marshes have some of their roots modified as hollow tubes that grow upward and function as snorkels, bringing down oxygen from the air.

Topsoil is home to an astonishing number and variety of organisms. A teaspoon of soil has about 5 billion bacteria that cohabit with various fungi, algae and other protists, insects, earthworms, nematodes, and the roots of plants. The activities of all these organisms affect the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Earthworms, for instance, aerate the soil by their burrowing and add mucus that holds fine soil particles together. The metabolism of bacteria alters the mineral composition of the soil. Plant roots extract water and minerals but also affect soil pH and reinforce the soil against erosion.

Humus, an important component of topsoil, is the decomposing organic material formed by the action of bacteria and fungi on dead organisms, feces, fallen leaves, and other organic refuse. Humus prevents clay from packing together and builds a crumbly soil that retains water but is still porous enough for the adequate aeration of roots. Humus is also a reservoir of mineral nutrients that are returned gradually to the soil as microorganisms decompose the organic matter.

The Availability of Soil Water and Minerals

After a heavy rainfall, water drains away from the larger spaces of the soil, but smaller spaces retain water because of its attraction for the soil particles, which have electrically charged surfaces. Some of this water adheres so tightly to the hydrophilic soil particles that it cannot be extracted by plants. The film of water bound less tightly to the particles is the water generally available to plants (FIGURE 37.6a, p. 772). It is not pure water, but a soil solution containing dissolved minerals. Roots absorb this soil solution.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 37-6. The availability of soil water and minerals.

Many minerals in soil--especially those that are positively charged, such as potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+)--adhere by electrical attraction to the negatively charged surfaces of clay particles. The presence of clay in a soil helps prevent the leaching (draining away) of mineral nutrients during heavy rain or irrigation because the finely divided particles provide so much surface area for binding minerals. However, clay particles must release their bound minerals to the soil solution in order for roots to absorb the nutrients. Minerals that are negatively charged, such as nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (H2PO4-), and sulfate (SO42-), are usually not bound tightly to soil particles and thus tend to leach away more quickly. Positively charged minerals are made available to the plant when hydrogen ions in the soil displace the mineral ions from the clay particles. This process, called cation exchange, is stimulated by the roots themselves, which secrete H+ and compounds that form acids in the soil solution (FIGURE 37.6b).





 Soil conservation is one step toward sustainable agriculture

It may take centuries for a soil to become fertile through the breakdown of rock and the accumulation of organic material, but human mismanagement can destroy that fertility within a few years. Soil mismanagement has been a recurring problem in human history. For example, the Dust Bowl was an ecological and human disaster that took place in the southwestern Great Plains region of the United States in the 1930s. Before the arrival of farmers, the region was covered by hardy grasses that held the soil in place in spite of the long recurrent droughts and torrential rains characteristic of the region. However, in the 30 years before World War I, a large number of homesteaders settled in the region, planting wheat and raising cattle. Both of these land uses left the soil exposed to the danger of erosion by the winds that constantly sweep over the area (FIGURE 37.7). Bad luck in the form of a few years of drought made the problem worse. In many places, 8-10 cm of topsoil were blown away. Millions of hectares of farmland became useless, and hundreds of thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes and land. Better soil conservation practices could have preserved the soil's fertility and sustained agricultural productivity.

Fig 37-7. Poor soil conservation has contributed to ecological disasters such as the Dust Bowl. The widespread planting of wheat and the raising of cattle by homesteaders in the southwestern plains states in the early part of the 20th century, in combination with recurrent droughts, left the land susceptible to wind erosion. The organic matter, clay, and silt in the soil were carried great distances by the winds, in some cases darkening the sky as far as the Atlantic coast. Sand and heavier materials drifted against houses, fences, and barns. In the 1930s, hundreds of thousands of people abandoned their homesteads. Many became destitute migrant laborers in California. Their plight was immortalized as a symbol of the Great Depression in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.

To understand soil conservation, we must begin with the premise that agriculture is unnatural. In forests, grasslands, and other natural ecosystems, mineral nutrients are usually recycled by the decomposition of dead organic material in the soil. In contrast, when we harvest a crop, essential elements are diverted from the chemical cycles going on in that location. In general, agriculture depletes the mineral content of the soil. To grow a ton of wheat grain, the soil gives up 18.2 kg of nitrogen, 3.6 kg of phosphorus, and 4.1 kg of potassium. Each year, the fertility of the soil diminishes unless fertilizers are applied to replace the lost minerals. Many crops also use far more water than the natural vegetation that once grew on that land, forcing farmers to irrigate. Prudent fertilization, thoughtful irrigation, and the prevention of erosion are three of the most important goals of soil conservation.

Fertilizers

Prehistoric farmers may have started fertilizing their fields after noticing that grass grew faster and greener where animals had defecated. The Romans used manure to fertilize their crops, and Native Americans buried fish along with seeds when they planted corn. In developed nations today, most farmers use commercially produced fertilizers containing minerals that are either mined or prepared by industrial processes. These fertilizers are usually enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the three mineral elements most commonly deficient in farm and garden soils. Commercial fertilizers, such as those you can buy in a garden shop, are labeled with a three-number code that indicates the mineral content. A fertilizer marked "10-12-8," for instance, is 10%  nitrogen (as ammonium or nitrate), 12%  phosphorus (as phosphoric acid), and 8%  potassium (as the mineral potash).

Manure, fishmeal, and compost are referred to as "organic" fertilizers because they are of biological origin and contain organic material that is in the process of decomposing. However, before the elements in compost can be of any use to plants, the organic material must be decomposed to the inorganic nutrients that roots can absorb. In the end, the minerals a plant extracts from the soil are in the same form whether they came from organic fertilizer or from a chemical factory. Compost releases minerals gradually, however, whereas the minerals in commercial fertilizers are available immediately but may not be retained by the soil for long. Excess minerals not taken up by the plants are usually wasted because they are often leached from the soil by rainwater or irrigation. To make matters worse, this mineral runoff may pollute the ground water and eventually reach streams and lakes. Agricultural researchers are attempting to develop ways to reduce the use of fertilizers while maintaining crop yields.

To fertilize judiciously, a farmer must pay close attention to the pH of the soil. Soil pH not only affects cation exchange but also influences the chemical form of all minerals. Even though an essential element may be abundant in the soil, plants may be starving for that element because it is bound too tightly to clay or is in a chemical form the plant cannot absorb. Managing the pH of soil is tricky; a change in hydrogen ion concentration may make one mineral more available to the plant while causing another mineral to become less available. At pH 8, for instance, the plant can absorb calcium, but iron is almost completely unavailable. The pH of the soil should be matched to the specific mineral needs of the crop. If the soil is too alkaline, sulfate can be added to lower the pH. Soil that is too acidic can be adjusted by liming (adding calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide).

A major problem with acid soils, particularly in tropical areas, is that aluminum dissolves in the soil at low pH and becomes toxic to roots. Some plants are able to cope with high aluminum levels in the soil by secreting certain organic anions that bind the aluminum and render it harmless.

Irrigation

Even more than mineral deficiencies, the unavailability of water most often limits the growth of plants. Irrigation can transform a desert into a garden, but farming in arid regions is a huge drain on water resources. Many of the rivers in the southwestern United States have been reduced to trickles by the diversion of water for irrigation. (Quenching the thirst of growing cities adds to the problem.) Another problem is that irrigation in an arid region can gradually make the soil so salty that it becomes completely infertile. Salts dissolved in the irrigation water accumulate in the soil as the water evaporates. Eventually, the salt makes the water potential of the soil solution lower than that of root cells, which then lose water instead of absorbing it (see Chapter 36).

As the world population continues to grow, more and more acres of arid land will have to be cultivated. New methods of irrigation may reduce the risks of running out of water or losing farmland to salinization (salt accumulation). For instance, drip irrigation is now used as an alternative to flooding fields for many of the crops and orchards in Israel and the western United States. In another approach to solving some of the problems of dryland farming, plant breeders are working to develop varieties of plants that require less water.

Erosion

Topsoil from thousands of acres of farmland is lost to water and wind erosion each year in the United States alone. Certain precautions can help reduce these losses. Rows of trees dividing fields make effective windbreaks, and terracing a hillside can prevent the topsoil from washing away in a heavy rain (FIGURE 37.8). Such crops as alfalfa and wheat provide good ground cover and protect the soil better than corn and other crops that are usually planted in rows.

Fig 37-8. The Grapes of Wrath. Contour tillage. These crops in Wisconsin are planted in rows that go around, rather than up and down, the hills. Contour tillage helps slow the runoff of water and erosion of topsoil after heavy rains.

If managed properly, soil is a renewable resource in which farmers can grow food for generations to come. The goal is sustainable agriculture, a commitment embracing a variety of farming methods that are conservation-minded, environmentally safe, and profitable.

Phytoremediation

Some areas have become unfit for agriculture or wildlife as a result of human activities that contaminate the soil or groundwater with toxic heavy metals or organic pollutants. Nonbiological technologies to detoxify soils, such as the removal and storage of contaminated soil in landfills, are costly and disrup tive to the landscape. Phytoremediation is an emerging, nondestructive technology that seeks to reclaim such contaminated areas cheaply by taking advantage of the remarkable ability of some plant species to extract heavy metals and other pollutants from the soil and to concentrate them in easily harvested portions of the plant. For example, alpine pennycress (Thlaspi caerulescens) can accumulate zinc in its shoots at concentrations that are 300 times the level that most plants can tolerate. The use of such plants for phytoremediation shows promise for cleaning up areas contaminated by smelters, mining operations, or nuclear testing. Phytoremediation is just part of the more general technology of bioremediation, which includes the use of prokaryotes for detoxifying polluted sites (see Chapters 27 and 55).





 The metabolism of soil bacteria makes nitrogen available to plants

It is ironic that plants sometimes suffer nitrogen deficiencies, for the atmosphere is nearly 80%  nitrogen. This atmospheric nitrogen, however, is gaseous N2, and plants cannot use nitrogen in that form. For plants to absorb nitrogen, it must first be converted to ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-). In contrast to other minerals, the NH4+ and NO3- in soil are not derived from the breakdown of parent rock. Over the short term, the main source of nitrogenous minerals is the decomposition of humus by microbes, including ammonifying bacteria (FIGURE 37.9). In this way, nitrogen present in organic compounds, such as proteins, is repackaged in inorganic compounds that can be recycled when they are absorbed as minerals by roots. However, nitrogen is lost from this local cycle when soil microbes called denitrifying bacteria convert NO3- to N2, which diffuses from the soil to the atmosphere. Still other bacteria, called nitrogen-fixing bacteria, restock nitrogenous minerals in the soil by converting N2 to NH3 (ammonia), a metabolic process called nitrogen fixation. The complex cycling of nitrogen in ecosystems is traced in detail in Chapter 54. Here we focus on nitrogen fixation and the other steps that lead directly to nitrogen assimilation by plants.

Fig 37-9. The role of soil bacteria in the nitrogen nutrition of plants. Ammonium is made available to plants by two types of soil bacteria: those that fix atmospheric N2 (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) and those that decompose organic material (ammonifying bacteria). Although plants absorb some ammonium from the soil, they absorb mainly nitrate, which is produced from ammonium by nitrifying bacteria. Plants reduce nitrate back to ammonium before incorporating the nitrogen into organic compounds. Xylem transports nitrogen from roots to shoots in the form of nitrate, amino acids, and various other organic compounds, depending on the species.

All life on Earth depends on nitrogen fixation, a process performed only by certain prokaryotes. Soil is populated by sev eral species of free-living bacteria that are among the nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes. (Other species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in plant roots in symbiotic relationships you will learn more about in the next section.) The conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a complicated, multi-step process, but we can simplify nitrogen fixation by just indicating the reactants and products:  One enzyme complex, called nitrogenase, catalyzes the entire reaction sequence, which reduces N2 to NH3 by adding electrons along with hydrogen ions. Notice that nitrogen fixation is very expensive in terms of metabolic energy, costing the bacteria eight ATP molecules for each ammonia molecule synthesized. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are most abundant in soils rich in organic material, which provides fuel for cellular respiration.

In the soil solution, ammonia picks up another hydrogen ion to form ammonium (NH4+), which plants can absorb. However, plants acquire their nitrogen mainly in the form of nitrate (NO3-), which is produced in the soil by nitrifying bacteria that oxidize ammonium (see FIGURE 37.9). After nitrate is absorbed by roots, a plant enzyme can reduce the nitrate back to ammonium, which other enzymes can then incorporate into amino acids and other organic compounds. Most plant species export nitrogen from roots to shoots, via the xylem, in the form of nitrate or organic compounds that have been synthesized in the roots.





 Improving the protein yield of crops is a major goal of agricultural research

The ability of plants to incorporate fixed nitrogen into proteins and other organic substances has a major impact on human welfare; the most common form of malnutrition in humans is protein deficiency. Either by choice or by economic necessity, the majority of people in the world--particularly in developing countries--have a predominantly vegetarian diet and thus depend mainly on plants for protein. Unfortunately, many plants have a low protein content, and the proteins that are present may be deficient in one or more of the amino acids that humans need from their diet. Improving the quality and quantity of proteins in crops is a major goal of agricultural research.

Plant breeding has resulted in new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice that are enriched in protein. However, many of these "super" varieties have an extraordinary demand for nitrogen, which is usually supplied in the form of commercial fertilizer. The industrial production of ammonia and nitrate from atmospheric nitrogen is, like biological nitrogen fixation, very expensive in energy costs. A chemical factory making fertilizer consumes large quantities of fossil fuels. Generally, the countries that most need high-protein crops are the ones least able to afford to pay the fuel bill. The use of new catalysts based on the mechanism by which nitrogenase fixes nitrogen may make commercial fertilizer production less costly in the future. Biochemists determined the structure of Rhizobium nitrogenase several years ago, providing a model for chemical engineers to design catalysts by imitating nature. Another strategy that could potentially increase protein yields of crops is to improve the productivity of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a process we examine in the next section.





 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation results from intricate interactions between roots and bacteria

Many plant families include species that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that give roots a built-in source of fixed nitrogen for assimilation into organic compounds. Most of the research on symbiotic nitrogen fixation has focused on agriculturally important members of the legume family, including peas, beans, soybeans, peanuts, alfalfa, and clover. A legume's roots have swellings called nodules composed of plant cells that contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium ("root living"). Inside the nodule, Rhizobium bacteria assume a form called bacteroids, which are contained within vesicles formed by the root cell (FIGURE 37.10). Each legume is associated with a particular species of Rhizobium. FIGURE 37.11 describes the steps in the development of root nodules after bacteria enter through what is called an infection thread.

In this TEM, a cell from a root nodule of soybean is filled with bacteroids in vesicles. The cell on the left is uninfected.

Fig 37-11. Development of a soybean root nodule.

The symbiotic relationship between a legume and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is mutualistic, with both partners benefiting. The bacteria supply the legume with fixed nitrogen, and the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. Most of the ammonium produced by symbiotic nitrogen fixation is used by the nodules to make amino acids, which are then transported to the shoot and leaves via the xylem.

Some root nodules have a reddish color owing to a molecule called leghemoglobin. Leghemoglobin is an iron-containing protein that, like the hemoglobin of human red blood cells, binds reversibly to oxygen (leg- is for legume). The root nodule's leghemoglobin acts as an oxygen "buffer," regulating the supply of oxygen for the intense respiration required by the bacteria to produce ATP for nitrogen fixation.

Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation and Agriculture

Now that you have learned about symbiotic nitrogen fixation, you can understand the agricultural practice of crop rotation. One year a nonlegume such as corn is planted, and the following year alfalfa or some other legume is planted to restore the concentration of fixed nitrogen in the soil. Instead of being harvested, the legume crop is often plowed under so that it will decompose as "green manure" (FIGURE 37.12). To ensure that the legume encounters its specific Rhizobium, the seeds are soaked in a culture of the bacteria or dusted with bacterial spores before sowing.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 37-12. Crop rotation and "green manure." The "green manure" being mulched into the soil of this Washington State farm is sweet clover, a legume with root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Every third year, clover is planted and the crop is plowed under. This improves the physical structure and nitrogen content of the soil for growing wheat and other crops during the other two years of the crop rotation cycle. Crop rotation, especially when the legume is mulched instead of harvested, reduces the need for manufactured fertilizers.

Many plant families besides legumes include species that benefit from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. For example, alders and certain tropical grasses host nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the actinomycete group (see Chapter 27). Rice, a crop of great commercial importance, benefits indirectly from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Rice farmers culture a water fern called Azolla in their paddies. The fern has symbiotic cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen and increase the fertility of the rice paddy. The growing rice eventually shades and kills the Azolla, and decomposition of this organic material adds more nitrogenous minerals to the paddy.

The Molecular Biology of Root Nodule Formation in Legumes

How does a legume species recognize a certain species of Rhizobium among the many bacterial species inhabiting a root's soil environment? And how does an encounter with that specific Rhizobium lead to the development of a nodule? These two questions have led researchers to a chemical dialogue between the bacteria and the root, with each partner responding to the chemical signals from the other by expressing certain genes whose products contribute to nodule formation (FIGURE 37.13). The plant initiates the communication when its roots secrete molecules called flavonoids, which enter Rhizobium cells living in the vicinity of the roots. The specificity of this signal arises from variations in flavonoid structure, with a particular legume species secreting a type of flavonoid that only a certain Rhizobium species will detect and absorb. The plant's signal triggers the production of an answering molecule by the bacterium. Specifically, the plant's signal molecule activates a gene-regulating protein, which switches on a cluster of bacterial genes called nod, for "nodulation" genes. The products of these genes are enzymes that catalyze production of species-specific molecules called Nod factors. Secreted by the bacterial cells, the Nod factors return the "hello" and signal the root to form the infection thread the Rhizobium will enter and to begin forming the root nodule (see FIGURE 37.11). The plant's responses require activation of genes called early nodulin genes, probably by gene-regulating signal-transduction pathways, such as those you learned about in Chapter 11.

Researchers have analyzed the molecular structure of the Nod factors for clues to these bacterial molecules' ability to influence genes within the cells of a plant. An early discovery, puzzling at the time, was that Nod factors are very similar to chitins, the main substances in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of arthropods (see Chapter 5). But now there is evidence that plants themselves produce chitinlike substances that probably function as growth regulators. This discovery led to the hypothesis that Nod factors mimic certain plant growth regulators in stimulating the roots to grow new organs--nodules, in this case. Researchers have also learned that the plant genes that must be expressed for nodules to form are genes that also function in many other developmental processes in plants. This suggests that researchers might someday learn to induce Rhizobium uptake and nodule formation in crop plants that do not normally form such nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships. A more likely outcome of continued research, however, is that scientists will learn to manipulate the molecular biology of the root-Rhizobium relationships of legumes and other natural nodule formers to improve the efficiency of nitrogen fixation and protein production by crops.





 Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations of roots and fungi that enhance plant nutrition

Mycorrhizae ("fungus roots") are modified roots consisting of symbiotic associations of fungi and roots (see FIGURES 31.18 and 36.8). The symbiosis is mutualistic. The fungus benefits from a hospitable environment and a steady supply of sugar donated by the host plant. In return, the fungus increases the surface area for water uptake and selectively absorbs phosphate and other minerals from the soil and supplies them to the plant. The fungi of mycorrhizae also secrete growth factors that stimulate roots to grow and branch. And the fungi produce antibiotics that may help protect the plant from pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi in the soil.

Mycorrhizae are not oddities; they are formed by almost all plant species. In fact, this plant-fungus symbiosis might have been one of the evolutionary adaptations that made it possible for plants to colonize land in the first place; fossilized roots from some of the earliest plants include mycorrhizae (see Chapter 31). When terrestrial ecosystems were young, the soil was probably not very rich in nutrients. The fungi of mycorrhizae, which are more efficient at absorbing minerals than the roots themselves, would have helped nourish the pioneering plants. Even today, the plants that first become established on nutrient-poor soils, such as abandoned farmland or eroded hillsides, are usually well endowed with mycorrhizae.

The Two Main Types of Mycorrhizae

The modified roots formed from the symbiosis of fungi and plants take two major forms: ectomycorrhizae and endomy corrhizae. In ectomycorrhizae, the mycelium (mass of branching hyphae; see Chapter 31) forms a dense sheath, or mantle, over the surface of the root (FIGURE 37.14a). Hyphae extend from the mantle into the soil, greatly increasing the surface area for water and mineral absorption. Fungal hyphae also grow into the cortex of the root. These hyphae do not penetrate the root cells but form a network in the extracellular spaces that facilitates nutrient exchange between the fungus and the plant. Compared with "uninfected" roots, ectomycorrhizae are generally thicker, shorter, and more branched. Ectomycorrhizae do not form root hairs, which would be superfluous given the extensive surface area of the fungal mycelium. Ectomycorrhizae are especially common in woody plants, including trees of the pine, spruce, oak, walnut, birch, willow, and eucalyptus families.

Fig 37-14. Mycorrhizae.

In contrast to ectomycorrhizae, endomycorrhizae do not have a dense mantle ensheathing the root (FIGURE 37.14b). It takes a microscope to see the fine fungal hyphae that extend from the root into the soil. Hyphae also extend inward (hence the term endomycorrhizae) by digesting small patches of the root cell walls. A hypha does not actually pierce the plasma membrane and enter the cytoplasm of the host cell, but instead grows into a tube formed by invagination of the root cell's membrane. The action is analogous to poking a finger gently into a balloon; your finger is like the fungal hypha, and the skin of the balloon is like the plant cell's membrane. Once they have penetrated in this way, some of the fungal hyphae become highly branched to form dense knotlike structures called arbuscles. These arbuscles are important sites of nutrient transfer between the fungus and the plant. To the unaided eye, endomycorrhizae look like "normal" roots with root hairs, but a microscope reveals a symbiotic relationship of enormous importance to plant nutrition. Endomycorrhizae, much more common than ectomycorrhizae, are found in over 90%  of plant species, including important crop plants such as corn, wheat, and legumes.

Agricultural Importance of Mycorrhizae

Roots can be transformed into mycorrhizae only if they are exposed to the appropriate species of fungus. In most natural ecosystems, these fungi are present in soil, and seedlings develop mycorrhizae. But if seeds are collected in one environment and planted in foreign soil, the plants may show signs of malnutrition resulting from the absence of the plants' mycorrhizal partners. Researchers observe similar results in experiments in which soil fungi are poisoned. Farmers and foresters are already applying the lessons of such research. For example, inoculating pine seeds with spores of mycorrhizal fungi promotes the formation of mycorrhizae by the seedlings. Pine seedlings so infected grow more vigorously than trees without the fungal association.





 Mycorrhizae and root nodules may have an evolutionary relationship

There is growing evidence that the molecular biology of root nodule formation is closely related to mechanisms that evolved first in mycorrhizae. In 1997, researchers reported that the nodulin genes activated in the plant during the early stages of root nodule formation are the very same genes activated during the early development of endomycorrhizae. In fact, mutations in these early nodulin genes block development of both root nodules and mycorrhizae in legumes that form both structures. In addition, the signal-transduction pathways that relay messages from the microorganisms to the plant's gene-regulating equipment involved in the development of both root nodules and mycorrhizae may share at least some components. For example, experimental application of plant hormones called cytokinins to root cells of legumes activates expression of the early nodulin genes even in the absence of the bacterial or fungal symbionts. (You will learn more about cytokinins and other plant hormones in Chapter 39.) "Infection" by either the bacteria or fungi causes the concentration of cytokinins in root tissue to increase naturally. These experiments suggest that the hormone is one of the links between the "I'm here" announcement of the microbes and the changes in gene expression in the plant that lead to structural modification of the roots. Even the chemical cues from the two kinds of microbes may be similar. Recall that the Nod factors secreted by Rhizobium bacteria are related to chitins, the same compounds that make up the cell walls of fungi. A reasonable hypothesis is that root cells have a family of closely related receptors that detect their particular bacterial and fungal symbionts.

Mycorrhizae, as you have learned, evolved very early, probably over 400 million years ago in the earliest vascular plants. In contrast, the root nodules of legumes originated only 65-150 million years ago, during the early evolution of angiosperms. The recent experiments revealing common molecular mechanisms in roots' two major symbiotic relationships suggest that root nodule development is at least partly adapted from a signaling pathway that was already in place in mycorrhizae. This is one more example of how evolution can co-opt existing equipment for new functions.





 Parasitic plants extract nutrients from other plants

The mistletoe we find tacked above doorways during the holiday season lives in nature as a parasite on oaks and other trees. Mistletoe is photosynthetic, but it supplements its nutrition by using projections called haustoria to siphon xylem sap from the vascular tissue of the host tree. Some parasitic plants, such as dodder (FIGURE 37.15a), do not perform photosynthesis at all, drawing all their nutrients from other plants by tapping into the host's vascular tissue. In another version of parasitism, Indian pipe obtains its nutrients from trees indirectly via its association with fungal hyphae of the host tree's mycorrhizae (FIGURE 37.15b).

Plants called epiphytes (from the Greek epi, upon, and phyton, plant) are sometimes mistaken for parasites. An epiphyte is an autotrophic plant that nourishes itself but grows on the surface of another plant, usually on the branches or trunks of trees. An epiphyte is anchored to its living substratum, but it absorbs water and minerals mostly from rain that falls on its leaves. Examples of epiphytes are staghorn ferns, some mosses, Spanish moss (actually an angiosperm), and many species of bromeliads and orchids.





 Carnivorous plants supplement their mineral nutrition by digesting animals

Living in acid bogs and other habitats where soil conditions are poor (especially in nitrogen) are plants that fortify themselves by occasionally feeding on animals. These carnivorous plants make their own carbohydrates by photosynthesis, but they obtain some of their nitrogen and minerals by killing and digesting insects and other small animals. Various kinds of insect traps have evolved by the modification of leaves (FIGURE 37.16). The traps are usually equipped with glands that secrete digestive juices. Fortunately for the animal kingdom, this ironic turnabout is a relatively rare exception to the standard ecosystem dynamics of animals eating plants!

Fig 37-16. Carnivorous plants. (a) The Venus flytrap is a mod ified leaf with two lobes that close together rapidly enough to capture an insect. Prey that enters the trap touches sensory hairs, initiating an electrical impulse that triggers closure of the trap. Glands in the trap then secrete digestive enzymes, and nutrients are later absorbed by the modified leaf. In spite of its name, the flytrap catches more ants and grasshoppers than it does flies. (b) Pitcher plants use a pitfall to capture insects. Insects slip into a long water-filled funnel. After the insect drowns, it is digested by enzymes secreted into the water.

It has been said that an oak is an acorn's way of making more acorns. Indeed, in a Darwinian view of life, the fitness of an organism is measured only by its ability to replace itself with healthy, fertile offspring. Consider the century plant (Agave) in the photograph on this page. It lives for decades without flowering, and then one spring it grows a floral stalk as tall as a telephone pole. That season the plant produces seeds and then withers and dies, its food reserves, minerals, and water spent in the formation of its massive bloom. Although not all flowering plants are as completely consumed as the century plant in leaving offspring, most of their other functions--for example, photosynthesis and growth--can be interpreted, in the broadest Darwinian sense, as mechanisms contributing to propagation. Sexual reproduction, as in the case of oak and Agave, however, is not the sole means by which flowering plants reproduce: Many species can also reproduce asexually, creating offspring that are genetically identical to themselves.

In Chapters 29 and 30, we approached plant reproduction from an evolutionary perspective, tracing the descent of angiosperms and other land plants from their aquatic ancestors, charophycean algae. In this chapter, we explore the reproductive biology of flowering plants (angiosperms) in much greater detail because they are the most important group of plants in most terrestrial ecosystems and in agriculture. In addition to examining both sexual and asexual reproduction of angiosperms, we will place plant biotechnology in the broader context of human intervention in the propagation and genetics of the angiosperm varieties we have been cultivating for millennia.

 Plant biotechnology has incited much public debate



Plant biotechnology has two meanings. In the general sense, it refers to innovations in the use of plants, or of substances obtained from plants, to make products of use to humans--an endeavor that began in prehistory. Used in a more specific sense, biotechnology refers to the use of genetically modified (GM) organisms in agriculture and industry. Indeed, in the last two decades, genetic engineering has become such a powerful--some would say too powerful--force in biotechnology that the terms genetic engineering and biotechnology have become synonymous in the media. In this last section, we examine the question of how humans have altered plants to suit their purposes from the birth of agriculture to the present.





 Sporophyte and gametophyte generations alternate in the life cycles of plants: a review

In Chapter 30 you learned about the life cycle of a flowering plant from an evolutionary perspective. The life cycles of angiosperms and other plants are characterized by an alternation of generations, in which haploid (n) and diploid (2n) generations take turns producing each other (see FIGURE 29.6). The diploid plant, which is called the sporophyte, produces haploid spores by meiosis. These spores divide by mitosis, giving rise to multicellular male and female haploid plants--the gametophytes. By mitosis and cellular differentiation, the gametophytes develop and produce gametes--sperm and eggs. Fertilization results in diploid zygotes, which divide by mitosis and form new sporophytes. FIGURE 38.1 follows the main stages of the angiosperm life cycle.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 38-1. Simplified overview of angiosperm life cycle. See FIGURE 30.17 for a more detailed version of the life cycle.

In angiosperms, the sporophyte is the dominant generation in the sense that it is the conspicuous plant we see. Over the course of seed plant evolution, gametophytes became reduced in size and dependent upon their sporophyte parents: Angiosperm gametophytes are the most reduced of all, consisting of only a few cells. The sporophyte also develops a reproductive structure unique to angiosperms--the flower. Male and female gametophytes develop within the anthers and ovaries, respectively, of a sporophyte flower (see FIGURE 38.1). Pollination by wind or animals brings a male gametophyte (pollen grain) to a female gametophyte; union of their gametes (fertilization) takes place within the ovary, as does the development of the seeds containing sporophyte embryos. The ovary itself becomes a fruit (another unique structure of the angiosperms).





 Flowers are specialized shoots bearing the reproductive organs of the angiosperm sporophyte

Flowers, the reproductive shoots of the angiosperm sporophyte, are typically composed of four whorls of highly modified leaves called floral organs, which are separated by very short internodes. Unlike vegetative shoots, which grow indeterminately, flowers are determinate shoots, meaning that they cease growing once the flower and fruit are formed.

The four kinds of floral organs, in sequence from the outside to the inside of the flower, are the sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Their site of attachment to the stem is the receptacle (FIGURE 38.2). Stamens and carpels are the male and female reproductive organs, respectively, whereas sepals and petals are nonreproductive organs. Sepals, which enclose and protect the floral bud before it opens, are usually green and more leaflike in appearance than the other floral organs. In many angiosperms, the petals are more brightly colored than sepals and advertise the flower to insects and other pollinators.

Fig 38-2. Review of an idealized flower.

A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a terminal structure called the anther; within the anther are chambers called pollen sacs, in which pollen is produced. A carpel has an ovary at its base and a slender neck called the style. At the top of the style is a sticky structure called the stigma that serves as a landing platform for pollen. Within the ovary are one or more ovules (the number depends on the species). The flower shown in FIGURE 38.2 has a single carpel, but the flowers of many species have multiple carpels. In some species, several carpels are fused into a single structure; the result is an ovary with two or more chambers, each containing one or more ovules.

The stamen and carpels of flowers contain the sporangia, the structures where first the spores and then the gametophytes develop. The male gametophytes are sperm-producing structures called pollen grains, which form within the pollen sacs of anthers. The female gametophytes are egg-producing structures called embryo sacs, which form within the ovules in ovaries.

For the egg within the embryo sac to be fertilized, the male and female gametophytes must meet and their gametes must unite. Pollination occurs when pollen released from anthers and carried by wind or animals lands on a stigma (not necessarily on the same flower or plant). Each pollen grain produces a structure called a pollen tube, which grows down into the ovary via the style and discharges sperm into the embryo sac, resulting in fertilization of the egg (see FIGURE 38.1). The zygote gives rise to an embryo, and as the embryo grows, the ovule that contains it develops into a seed. The entire ovary, meanwhile, develops into a fruit containing one or more seeds, depending on the species. Fruits, carried by wind or by animals, help disperse seeds some distance from their source plants. If deposited in sufficiently moist soil, seeds germinate; that is, their embryos start growing into seedlings, a new generation of flowering sporophytes.

Numerous floral variations have evolved during the 130 million years of angiosperm history (FIGURE 38.3, p. 786). In certain flowers, one or more of the four basic floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--have been eliminated. Plant biologists distinguish between complete flowers, those having all four organs, and incomplete flowers, those lacking one or more of the four floral parts. For example, most grasses have incomplete flowers lacking petals.

Fig 38-3. A few examples of floral diversity. (a) Trillium. This Trillium flower is complete, meaning that sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are all present. (b) Lupines. Lupines are examples of plants with inflorescences, clusters of flowers. (c) Sunflowers. What appears in this sunflower to be a single flower is actually a collection of hundreds. The central disk of this composite inflorescence consists of tiny complete flowers. What appear to be petals ringing the central disk are actually imperfect flowers called ray flowers. (d) Hibiscus. The diverse shapes, colors, and odors of flowers also reflect adaptations to different modes of pollination. For example, Hibiscus pollinators include hummingbirds, which are attracted to the red color. (e) Maize. Maize is a monoecious species with inflorescences of carpellate (female) and staminate (male) flowers on the same individual plant. An "ear" of maize is a collection of kernels (one-seeded fruits) that develops from an inflorescence of fertilized carpellate flowers. The maize "silk" is composed of numerous long styles (left). The staminate inflorescences are the tassels (right). (f) Sagittaria. Sagittaria is dioecious, its staminate (left) and carpellate (right) flowers on separate plants.

The presence or absence of reproductive organs further distinguishes flowers. A bisexual flower (in older terminology termed a "perfect" flower) is equipped with both stamens and carpels. Complete flowers such as the Trillium shown in FIGURE 38.3a are always bisexual, because they have all four types of floral organs, but an incomplete flower that lacks sepals or petals may also be bisexual.

A unisexual flower (or "imperfect" flower in older terminology) is missing either stamens or carpels. Unisexual flowers are called staminate or carpellate, depending on which set of reproductive organs is present. If staminate and carpellate flowers are located on the same individual plant, then that plant species is said to be monoecious (from a Greek word meaning "one house"). Maize and other corn varieties are examples. The "ears" of a maize plant are derived from clusters of carpellate flowers, while the tassels consist of staminate flowers (FIGURE 38.3e). In contrast, a dioecious ("two houses") species, such as Sagittaria, has staminate flowers and carpellate flowers on separate plants (FIGURE 38.3f). Date palms are dioecious. Because dates develop only on the carpellate (female) palms, commercial date growers plant mostly carpellate individuals. A few staminate male plants provide enough pollen for hundreds of females.

In addition to these differences based on the presence of floral organs, flowers have many variations in size, shape, and color (see FIGURE 38.3). Much of this diversity represents adaptations of flowers to different animal pollinators. Indeed, the presence of animals in the environment was a key factor in angiosperm evolution (see Chapter 30).

The following concepts describe the development of angiosperm gametophytes, then trace how pollination leads to fertilization and the development of embryos, seeds, and fruits. Keep in mind, however, that there are many variations in the details of these processes, depending on the species of flowering plant.





 Male and female gametophytes develop within anthers and ovaries, respectively: Pollination brings them together

Development of the Male Gametophyte (Pollen Grain)

Within the sporangia (pollen sacs) of an anther are numerous diploid cells called microsporocytes. Each microsporocyte undergoes meiosis, forming four haploid microspores, each of which can eventually give rise to a haploid male gametophyte (FIGURE 38.4a).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 38-4. The development of angiosperm gametophytes (pollen and embryo sacs). (a) Pollen grains (immature male gametophytes) develop within the sporangia (pollen sacs) of anthers at the tips of stamens. The pollen grain becomes a mature male gametophyte when its generative cell divides to form two sperm. This usually occurs after a pollen grain lands on the stigma of a carpel and the pollen tube begins to grow (see FIGURE 38.1). (b) The embryo sac (female gametophyte) develops within an ovule, itself enclosed by the ovary at the base of a carpel. Within the ovule's sporangium is a large, diploid cell called the megasporocyte. The megasporocyte in this species divides by meiosis and gives rise to four haploid cells, but only one of these survives as the megaspore. (This contrasts with pollen formation, in which all four products of meiosis go on to form gametophytes.) Three mitotic divisions of the megaspore form the embryo sac, a multicellular female gametophyte. The ovule now consists of the embryo sac along with the surrounding integuments (protective tissues).

A microspore divides once by mitosis and produces two cells, a generative cell and a tube cell. The generative cell will eventually produce sperm. The tube cell, which encloses the generative cell, will produce the pollen tube, a structure essential for sperm delivery to the egg. The two-celled structure is encased in a thick, resistant wall that becomes sculptured into an elaborate pattern unique to the particular plant species (FIGURE 38.5). Together, the two cells and their wall constitute a pollen grain, which at this stage of its development is an immature male gametophyte.

Fig 38-5. Pollen grains have tough, ornate, and distinctive walls. The resilient wall of a pollen grain protects the male gametophyte. This is ragweed pollen (colorized SEM). Because of their tough walls, pollen grains are preserved well in the fossil record. The species of fossilized pollen found in an area can provide insights into the past climates of the area.

A pollen grain becomes a mature male gametophyte when the generative cell divides by mitosis to form two sperm cells. In most species, this process occurs after the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a carpel and the pollen tube begins to form (see FIGURE 38.1).

Development of the Female Gametophyte (Embryo Sac)

Ovules, each containing a single sporangium, form within the chambers of the ovary. One cell in the sporangium of each ovule, the megasporocyte, grows and then goes through meiosis, producing four haploid megaspores (FIGURE 38.4b).

The details of the next steps vary extensively, depending on the species. In many angiosperms (such as the one illustrated in FIGURE 38.4), only one of the megaspores survives. This megaspore continues to grow, and its nucleus divides by mitosis three times, resulting in one large cell with eight haploid nuclei. Membranes then partition this mass into a multicellular female gametophyte--the embryo sac. At one end of the embryo sac are three cells: the egg cell, or female gamete, and two cells called synergids. The synergids flank the egg cell and function in the attraction and guidance of the pollen tube. At the opposite end of the embryo sac are three antipodal cells of unknown function. The remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei, are not partitioned into separate cells but share the cytoplasm of the large central cell of the embryo sac. The ovule, which will eventually become a seed, now consists of the embryo sac and the surrounding integuments (protective layers of sporophytic tissue).

Pollination

Pollination, which brings the male and female gametophytes together, is the first step in the chain of events that leads to fertilization. This step is accomplished in various ways. Some angiosperms, including grasses and many trees, use wind as a pollinating agent. They compensate for the randomness of this dispersal by releasing enormous quantities of tiny pollen grains. At certain times of the year, the air is loaded with pollen, as anyone plagued with pollen allergies can attest. Many angiosperms, however, do not rely on the aimless wind to carry pollen but interact with insects or other animals that transfer pollen directly between flowers.





 Plants have various mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization

Some flowers self-fertilize (this is called "selfing"), but the majority of angiosperms have mechanisms that make it difficult or impossible for a flower to fertilize itself. The various barriers that prevent self-fertilization contribute to genetic variety by ensuring that sperm and eggs come from different parents. (The evolutionary and ecological importance of sexual reproduction is discussed in Chapter 23.) Dioecious plants, of course, cannot self-fertilize because they are unisexual, being either staminate or carpellate. In some plants with bisexual flowers, the stamens and carpels mature at different times or are structurally arranged in such a way that it is unlikely that an animal pollinator could transfer pollen from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower (FIGURE 38.6). However, the most common anti-selfing mechanism in flowering plants is self-incompatibility, the ability of a plant to reject its own pollen and the pollen of closely related individuals. If a pollen grain from an anther happens to land on a stigma of a flower on the same plant, a biochemical block prevents the pollen from completing its development and fertilizing an egg.

Fig 38-6. "Pin" and "thrum" flower types reduce self-fertilization. Some species, such as primrose (Oenothera biennis), produce two types of flowers: "pins," which have long styles and short stamens, and "thrums," which have short styles and long stamens. An insect foraging for nectar would collect pollen on different parts of its body; pin pollen would be deposited on thrum stigmas, and vice versa.

Researchers are unraveling the molecular mechanisms of self-incompatibility. This plant response is analogous to the immune response of animals, in the sense that both are based on the ability of organisms to distinguish the cells of "self" from those of "nonself." The key difference is that the animal immune system rejects nonself, as when the system mounts a defense against a pathogen or attempts to reject a transplanted organ. Self-incompatibility in plants, in contrast, is a rejection of self.

Recognition of "self" pollen is based on genes for self-incompatibility, called S-genes (FIGURE 38.7). In a particular plant population, as many as 50 different alleles can occur at the S-locus. If a pollen grain and the carpel's stigma upon which it lands have matching alleles at the S-locus, then the pollen grain fails to initiate or complete formation of a pollen tube, and thus no fertilization occurs. The pollen grain is haploid, and it will be recognized as "self" if its one S-allele matches either of the two S-alleles of the diploid stigma.

Fig 38-7. Genetic basis of self-incompatibility. In the gene pool of a plant population, there can be dozens of alleles of the S-gene. If a pollen grain has an allele that matches an allele of the stigma upon which it lands, then a pollen tube fails to grow.

Although self-incompatibility genes are all referred to as S-loci, such genes have actually evolved independently in various plant families. As a consequence, self-recognition blocks pollen tube growth by different molecular mechanisms. In some cases, the block occurs in the pollen grain itself; this is called gametophytic self-incompatibility. For example, in some members of the tobacco, rose, and bean (legume) families, self-recognition leads to enzymatic destruction of RNA within a rudimentary pollen tube. The RNA-hydrolyzing enzymes, or RNases, are present in the style of the carpel, but apparently they can enter a pollen tube and attack its RNA only if the pollen is of a "self" type.

In other cases, the block is a response by the cells of the carpel's stigma; this is called sporophytic self-incompatibility (because the carpel is part of the sporophyte). In members of the mustard family, for example, self-recognition activates a signal-transduction pathway in epidermal cells of the stigma that prevents germination of the pollen grain (FIGURE 38.8). Recent research suggests that one of the responses of the stigma to self-pollen is the opening of aquaporins, membrane proteins that function in water transport (see Chapter 36). Uptake of additional water by the stigma cell might block pollen germination by preventing the stigma from hydrating the relatively dry pollen, a step required for growth of a pollen tube. This model of self-incompatibility will certainly evolve as researchers learn more about how certain plants reject their own pollen.

Fig 38-8. A possible mechanism of sporophytic self-incompatibility. In plants of the mustard family, there are at least two protein products of the S-locus. (The genes coding for these proteins are so tightly linked that they are inherited as though a single gene.) One of the protein products, labeled R in this diagram, is a receptor protein located in the extracellular matrix (wall) of the stigma epidermal cell. Another product of the S-locus is a protein kinase (K) embedded in the plasma membrane of the stigma cell. (A protein kinase, recall from Chapter 11, is an enzyme that activates other proteins by phosphorylating them.) These proteins interact according to the steps in this diagram of a hypothetical mechanism for self-incompatibility.

Basic research on mechanisms of self-incompatibility may lead to agricultural applications. Plant breeders sometimes hybridize different varieties of a crop plant to combine the best traits of the varieties and counter the loss of vigor that can result from excessive inbreeding (see Chapter 14). Many agriculturally important plants are self-compatible. To maximize the number of hybrid seeds, breeders currently must prevent self-fertilization by laboriously removing the anthers from the parent plants that provide the seeds. Eventually, it may be possible instead to impose self-incompatibility on crop species that are normally self-compatible.





 Double fertilization gives rise to the zygote and endosperm

After landing on a receptive stigma, a pollen grain absorbs moisture and germinates--that is, it produces a pollen tube that extends down between the cells of the style toward the ovary (FIGURE 38.9, p. 790). The generative cell divides by mitosis and forms two sperm, the male gametes. The germinated pollen grain is the mature male gametophyte. Directed by a chemical attractant, possibly calcium, the tip of the pollen tube enters the ovary, probes through the micropyle (a gap in the integuments of the ovule), and discharges its two sperm within the embryo sac.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 38-9. Growth of the pollen tube and double fertilization. After a pollen grain is carried by wind or an animal to the stigma, a long pollen tube begins growing down the style toward the ovary. The tube discharges two sperm into the embryo sac of an ovule. One sperm fertilizes the egg, forming the zygote. The other combines with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac's large central cell and forms a triploid cell that will develop into a nutritive tissue called endosperm.

The events that follow are a distinctive feature of the an giosperm life cycle (shared only with a few gymnosperms, in which the process probably evolved independently). One sperm fertilizes the egg to form the zygote. The other sperm combines with the two polar nuclei to form a triploid (3n) nucleus in the center of the large central cell of the embryo sac. This large cell will give rise to the endosperm, a food-storing tissue of the seed. The union of two sperm cells with different nuclei of the embryo sac is termed double fertilization. Double fertilization ensures that the endosperm will develop only in ovules where the egg has been fertilized, thereby preventing angiosperms from squandering nutrients.

The nonreproductive tissues surrounding the embryo sac have prevented researchers from visualizing fertilization in plants. Recently, however, scientists isolated sperm cells from pollen grains and eggs from embryo sacs and observed the merging of plant gametes invitro. The first cellular event that takes place after gamete fusion is an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels of the egg, as also occurs during animal gamete fusion (see Chapter 47). Another similarity to animals is the establishment of a block to polyspermy, the fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm cell. Maize (Zea mays) sperm cannot fuse with zygotes in vitro. This barrier is established as early as 45 seconds after the initial sperm fusion with the egg in maize. The block to polyspermy in animals occurs in two stages; a fast block within milliseconds reinforced by a slow block to polyspermy that requires many seconds. In the case of plants, one hypothesis for the slow block to polyspermy is a deposition of cell wall material that mechanically impedes sperm. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the fertilization envelope that leads to a slow block to polyspermy in several animal species. The opening of ion channels in the plasma membrane of the egg might also lead to a fast block to polyspermy, as occurs in several animal species (see Chapter 47).





 The ovule develops into a seed containing an embryo and a supply of nutrients

After double fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed, and the ovary develops into a fruit enclosing the seed(s). As the embryo develops from the zygote, the seed stockpiles proteins, oils, and starch. This is why seeds are such major nutrient sinks (see Chapter 36). Initially, these nutrients are stored in the endosperm, but later in seed development in many species, the storage function of the endosperm is more or less taken over by the swelling storage leaves (cotyledons) of the embryo itself.

Endosperm Development

Endosperm development usually precedes embryo development. After double fertilization, the triploid nucleus of the ovule's central cell divides, forming a multinucleate "supercell" having a milky consistency. This liquid mass, the endosperm, becomes multicellular when cytokinesis partitions the cytoplasm by forming membranes between the nuclei. Eventually, these "naked" cells produce cell walls, and the endosperm becomes solid. Coconut "milk" is an example of liquid endosperm; coconut "meat" is an example of solid endosperm.

The endosperm is rich in nutrients, which it provides to the developing embryo. In most monocots and some dicots, the endosperm also stores nutrients that can be used by the seedling after germination. In many dicots (including bean seeds), the food reserves of the endosperm are completely exported to the cotyledons (seed leaves) before the seed completes its development, and consequently the mature seed lacks endosperm.

Embryo Development

The first mitotic division of the zygote is transverse, splitting the fertilized egg into a basal cell and a terminal cell (FIGURE 38.10). The terminal cell eventually gives rise to most of the embryo. The basal cell continues to divide transversely, producing a thread of cells called the suspensor, which anchors the embryo to its parent. The suspensor functions in the transfer of nutrients to the embryo from the parent plant and, in some plants, from the endosperm. Meanwhile, the terminal cell divides several times and forms a spherical proembryo attached to the suspensor. The cotyledons (seed leaves) begin to form as bumps on the proembryo. A dicot, with its two cotyledons, is heart-shaped at this stage. Only one cotyledon develops in monocots.

Fig 38-10. The development of a dicot plant embryo. By the time the ovule becomes a mature seed and the integuments harden and thicken to form the seed coat, the zygote has given rise to an embryonic plant with rudimentary organs.

Soon after the rudimentary cotyledons appear, the embryo elongates. Cradled between the cotyledons is the apical meristem of the embryonic shoot. At the opposite end of the embryo's axis, where the suspensor attaches, is the apex of the embryonic root, also with a meristem. After the seed germinates, the apical meristems at the tips of shoot and root will sustain primary growth as long as the plant lives (see Chapter 35). The three primary meristems--protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium--are also present in the embryo. Thus, development of the embryo establishes two features of plant form: the root-shoot axis, with meristems at opposite ends; and a radial pattern of protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium, set to give rise to the three tissue systems (dermal, ground, and vascular tissues).

Structure of the Mature Seed

During the last stages of its maturation, the seed dehydrates until its water content is only about 5-15%  of its weight. The embryo, surrounded by its enlarged cotyledons or endosperm, or both, stops growing until the seed germinates. The embryo and its food supply are enclosed by a protective seed coat formed from the integuments of the ovule.

We can take a closer look at one type of dicot seed by splitting open the seed of a common bean. At this stage, the embryo consists of an elongate structure, the embryonic axis, attached to fleshy cotyledons (FIGURE 38.11a, p. 792). Below the point at which the cotyledons are attached, the embryonic axis is called the hypocotyl (from the Greek hypo, "under"). The hypocotyl terminates in the radicle, or embryonic root. The portion of the embryonic axis above the cotyledons is the epicotyl (from the Greek epi, "on" or "over"). At its tip is the plumule, consisting of the shoot tip with a pair of miniature leaves.

Fig 38-11. Seed structure.

The cotyledons of the common bean are fleshy before the seed germinates because they absorbed food from the endosperm when the seed developed. However, the seeds of some dicots, such as castor beans (Ricinus communis), retain their food supply in the endosperm and have cotyledons that are very thin (FIGURE 38.11b). The cotyledons will absorb nutrients from the endosperm and transfer them to the embryo when the seed germinates.

The seed of a monocot has a single cotyledon (FIGURE 38.11c). Members of the grass family, including maize and wheat, have a specialized type of cotyledon called a scutellum (L. scutella, "small shield," a reference to the scutellum's shape). The scutellum is very thin, with a large surface area pressed against the endosperm, from which the scutellum absorbs nutrients during germination. The embryo of a grass seed is enclosed by two sheathes, a coleorhiza, which covers the young root, and a coleoptile, which covers the young shoot.





 The ovary develops into a fruit adapted for seed dispersal

As the seeds are developing from ovules, the ovary of the flower is developing into a fruit, which protects the enclosed seeds and aids in their dispersal by wind or animals. Pollination triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to begin its transformation into a fruit (FIGURE 38.12). If a flower has not been pollinated, fruit usually does not develop, and the entire flower withers and falls away.

Fig 38-12. Development of a pea fruit (pod). (Also, see FIGURE 30.15.) These photographs illustrate the changes in a pea plant leading to pod formation. (a) Soon after pollination, (b) the flower drops its petals, and hormonal changes make the ovary start growing. The ovary expands, and its wall thickens, (c) forming the pod, or fruit.

During fruit development, the wall of the ovary becomes the pericarp, the thickened wall of the fruit. As the ovary grows, the other parts of the flower wither and are shed. (The pointed tip of the pea pod in FIGURE 38.12 is the withered remains of the pea flower's stigma.) However, in some angiosperms, other floral parts also contribute to what we call a fruit in grocery store vernacular. In apple flowers, for example, the ovary is embedded in the receptacle (see FIGURE 38.2), and the fleshy part of the fruit is derived mainly from the swollen receptacle; only the core of the apple fruit develops from the ovary. Fruits are classified into several types, depending on their developmental origin (see TABLE 30.1).

The fruit usually ripens about the same time that its seeds are completing their development. For a dry fruit such as a soybean pod, ripening is little more than senescence (aging) of the fruit tissues, which allows the fruit to open and release the seeds. The ripening of a fleshy fruit is more elaborate, its steps controlled by the complex interactions of hormones. In this case, ripening results in an edible fruit that serves as an enticement to the animals that help spread the seeds. The "pulp" of the fruit becomes softer as a result of enzymes digesting components of the cell walls. There is usually a color change from green to some other color such as red, orange, or yellow. The fruit becomes sweeter as organic acids or starch molecules are converted to sugar, which may reach a concentration of as much as 20%  in a ripe fruit.

By selectively breeding plants, humans have capitalized on the production of edible fruits. The apples, oranges, and other fruits in grocery stores are exaggerated versions of much smaller natural varieties of fleshy fruits. However, the staple foods for humans are the dry, wind-dispersed fruits of grasses, which are harvested while still on the parent plant. The cereal grains of wheat, rice, maize, and other grasses are easily mistaken for seeds, but each is actually a fruit with a dry pericarp that adheres tightly to the seed coats of the single seed within.





 Evolutionary adaptations of seed germination contribute to seedling survival

As a seed matures, it dehydrates and enters a phase referred to as dormancy (from the Latin word meaning "to sleep"), a condition of extremely low metabolic rate and a suspension of growth and development. A plant resumes the growth and development that were temporarily suspended when the seed and its embryo became dormant. Conditions required to break dormancy vary between plant species. Some seeds germinate as soon as they are in a suitable environment. Other seeds remain dormant and will not germinate, even if sown in a favorable place, until a specific environmental cue causes them to break dormancy.

Seed Dormancy

Seed dormancy increases the chances that germination will occur at a time and place most advantageous to the seedling. Breaking dormancy generally requires certain environmental conditions. Seeds of many desert plants, for instance, germinate only after a substantial rainfall. If they were to germinate after mild drizzle, the soil might soon be too dry to support the seedlings. Where natural fires are common, many seeds require intense heat to break dormancy; seedlings are therefore most abundant after fire has cleared away competing vegetation. Where winters are harsh, seeds may require extended exposure to cold; seeds sown during summer or fall do not germinate until the following spring. This assures a long growth season before the next winter. Very small seeds, such as those of some lettuce varieties, require light for germination and will break dormancy only if they are buried shallow enough for the seedlings to poke through the soil surface. Some seeds have coats that must be weakened by chemical attack as they pass through an animal's digestive tract, and thus are likely to be carried some distance before germinating.

The length of time a dormant seed remains viable and capable of germinating varies from a few days to decades or even longer, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Most seeds are durable enough to last a year or two until conditions are favorable for germinating. Thus, the soil has a pool of nongerminated seeds that may have accumulated for several years. This is one reason vegetation reappears so rapidly after a fire, drought, flood, or some other environmental disruption.

From Seed to Seedling

Germination of seeds depends on the physical process of imbibition, the uptake of water due to the low water potential of the dry seed. Imbibing water causes the seed to expand and rupture its coat and also triggers metabolic changes in the embryo that enable it to resume growth (FIGURE 38.13). Following hydration, enzymes begin digesting the storage materials of the endosperm or cotyledons, and the nutrients are transferred to the growing regions of the embryo (FIGURE 38.13).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 38-13. Mobilization of nutrients during the germination of a barley seed. After the seed imbibes water, the embryo releases hormones called gibberellins (GA) as signals to the aleurone, the thin outer layer of the endosperm. The aleurone responds by synthesizing and secreting digestive enzymes that hydrolyze stored foods in the endosperm, producing small, soluble molecules. One example is a-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch. (A similar enzyme in our saliva helps us digest bread and other foods made from the starchy endosperm of ungerminated seeds.) Sugars and other nutrients absorbed from the endosperm by the scutellum are consumed during growth of the embryo into a seedling.

The first organ to emerge from the germinating seed is the radicle, the embryonic root. Next, the shoot tip must break through the soil surface. In garden beans and many other dicots, a hook forms in the hypocotyl, and growth pushes the hook aboveground (FIGURE 38.14a). Stimulated by light, the hypocotyl straightens, raising the cotyledons and epicotyl. Thus, the delicate shoot apex and bulky cotyledons are pulled aboveground, rather than being pushed tip-first through the abrasive soil. The epicotyl now spreads its first foliage leaves (true leaves, so called to distinguish them from cotyledons, or "seed leaves"). The foliage leaves expand, become green, and begin making food by photosynthesis. The cotyledons shrivel and fall away from the seedling, their food reserves having been consumed by the germinating embryo.

Fig 38-14. Seed germination. The radicle, the root of the embryo, emerges from the seed first. Then the shoot breaks the soil surface by one of the following mechanisms. (a) In beans, straightening of a hook in the hypocotyl pulls the cotyledons from the soil. (b) In peas, the hook is above the cotyledons on the epicotyl, and the cotyledons remain underground. (c) In corn and other grasses, the shoot grows straight up through the tube of the coleoptile.

Light seems to be the main cue that tells the seedling it has broken ground. We can trick a bean seedling into behaving as though it is still buried by germinating the seed in darkness. The seedling extends an exaggerated hypocotyl with a hook at its tip, and the foliage leaves fail to green. After it exhausts its food reserves, the spindly seedling stops growing and dies.

Peas, although in the same family as beans, have a different style of germinating (FIGURE 38.14b). A hook forms in the epicotyl rather than the hypocotyl, and the shoot tip is lifted gently out of the soil by elongation of the epicotyl and straightening of the hook. Pea cotyledons, unlike those of beans, remain behind underground.

Corn and other grasses, which are monocots, use yet a different method for breaking ground when they germinate (FIGURE 38.14c). The coleoptile, the sheath enclosing and protecting the embryonic shoot, pushes upward through the soil and into the air. The shoot tip then grows straight up through the tunnel provided by the tubular coleoptile.

Seed germination is a precarious stage in a plant's life. The tough seed gives rise to a fragile seedling that will be exposed to predators, parasites, wind, and other hazards. In the wild, only a small fraction of seedlings endure long enough to become parents themselves. Production of enormous numbers of seeds compensates for the odds against individual survival and gives natural selection ample genetic variations to screen. However, this is a very expensive means of reproduction in terms of the resources consumed in flowering and fruiting. Asexual reproduction, generally simpler and less hazardous for offspring than sexual reproduction, is an alternative means of plant propagation.





 Many plants clone themselves by asexual reproduction

Imagine some of your fingers separating from your body, taking up life on their own, and eventually developing into entire copies of yourself. This would be an example of asexual reproduction: offspring derived from a single parent without genetic recombination (which, of course, does not actually occur in humans). The result would be a clone, a population of asexually produced, genetically identical organisms. Many plant species clone themselves by asexual reproduction, also called vegetative reproduction.

Asexual reproduction is an extension of the capacity of plants for indeterminate growth. Plants, remember, have meristematic tissues of dividing, undifferentiated cells that can sustain or renew growth indefinitely. In addition, parenchyma cells throughout the plant can divide and differentiate into the various types of specialized cells, enabling plants to regenerate lost parts. Detached fragments of some plants can develop into whole offspring; a severed stem, for instance, may develop adventitious roots and become a whole plant. Fragmentation, the separation of a parent plant into parts that re-form whole plants, is one of the most common modes of vegetative reproduction (FIGURE 38.15a). A variation of this process occurs in some species of dicots, in which the root system of a single parent gives rise to many adventitious shoots that become separate shoot systems. The result is a clone formed by asexual reproduction from one parent (FIGURE 38.15b). Such asexual propagation has produced the oldest of all known plant clones, a ring of creosote bushes in the Mojave Desert of California, believed to be at least 12,000 years old.

Fig 38-15. Natural mechanisms of vegetative reproduction. (a) Kalanchoe is known as the maternity plant because of the numerous plantlets it produces along its leaf margins. The asexually produced plantlets fragment from their parent and become independent plants. (b) Some aspen groves, such as those shown here, are actually clones of thousands of trees descended by asexual reproduction from the root system of one parent. Notice that genetic differences among the clones result in different timing for the development of fall color and the loss of leaves.

An entirely different mechanism of asexual reproduction has evolved in dandelions and some other plants, which produce seeds without their flowers being fertilized. This asexual production of seeds is called apomixis. A diploid cell in the ovule gives rise to the embryo, and the ovules mature into seeds, which in the dandelion are dispersed by windblown fruit. Thus, though these plants clone themselves by an asexual process, they also have the advantage of seed dispersal, an adaptation usually associated with sexual reproduction.





 Sexual and asexual reproduction are complementary in the life histories of many plants

Many plants are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, and each offers advantages in certain situations. Sex generates variation in a population, an asset in an environment where evolving pathogens and other variables affect survival and reproductive success. An additional benefit of sexual reproduction in plants is the seed, which can disperse to new locations and can also wait to grow until hostile environmental conditions have improved.

An advantage of asexual reproduction is that a plant well suited to a particular environment can clone many copies of itself rapidly. Moreover, the offspring of vegetative reproduction, usually mature fragments of the parent plant, are not as frail as the seedlings produced by sexual reproduction. A sprawling clone of prairie grass may cover an area so thoroughly that seedlings of the same or other species have little chance of competing. But in the soil is a pool of seeds, waiting in the wings for some cue to germinate. After a fire, drought, or some other disturbance clears patches of the turf, seedlings can finally get a foothold when conditions improve. The seedlings are unequal in their traits, for their genotypes are products of the sexual recombination of genes. A new competition ensues, in which certain plants excel and clone themselves. Both modes of reproduction, sexual and asexual, have contributed to the success of plants in diverse terrestrial environments.





 Vegetative propagation of plants is common in agriculture

With the objective of improving crops, orchards, and ornamental plants, various methods have been devised for propagating plants asexually. Most are based on the ability of plants to form adventitious roots or shoots.

Clones from Cuttings

Most houseplants, woody ornamentals, and orchard trees are asexually reproduced from plant fragments called cuttings. In some cases, shoot or stem cuttings are used. At the cut end of the shoot a mass of dividing, undifferentiated cells called a callus forms, and then adventitious roots develop from the callus. If the shoot fragment includes a node, then adventitious roots form without a callus stage. Some plants, including African violets, can be propagated from single leaves rather than stems. For still other plants, cuttings are taken from specialized storage stems. For example, a potato can be cut up into several pieces, each with a vegetative bud, or "eye," that regenerates a whole plant.

In a modification of vegetative reproduction from cuttings, a twig or bud from one plant can be grafted onto a plant of a closely related species or a different variety of the same species. Grafting makes it possible to combine the best qualities of different species or varieties into a single plant. The graft is usually done when the plant is young. The plant that provides the root system is called the stock; the twig grafted onto the stock is referred to as the scion. For example, scions from French varieties of vines that produce superior wine grapes are grafted onto root stock of American varieties, which are more resistant to certain soil pathogens. The quality of the fruit, determined by the genes of the scion, is not diminished by the genetic makeup of the stock. In some cases of grafting, however, the stock can alter the characteristics of the shoot system that develops from the scion. For example, dwarf fruit trees are made by grafting normal twigs onto dwarf stock varieties that retard the vegetative growth of the shoot system. Because seeds are produced by the part of the plant derived from the scion, they would give rise to plants of the scion species if planted.

Test-Tube Cloning and Related Techniques

Plant biotechnologists have adopted in vitro methods to create and clone novel plant varieties. It is possible to grow whole plants by culturing small explants (pieces of tissue cut from the parent), or even single parenchyma cells, on an artificial medium containing nutrients and hormones (FIGURE 38.16). The cultured cells divide and form an undifferentiated callus. When the hormonal balance is manipulated in the culture medium, the callus can sprout shoots and roots with fully differentiated cells. The test-tube plantlets can then be transferred to soil, where they continue their growth. A single plant can be cloned into thousands of copies by subdividing calluses as they grow. This method is used for propagating orchids and also for cloning pine trees that deposit wood at unusually fast rates (see FIGURE 30.8f).

Fig 38-16. Test-tube cloning of carrots. (a) Just a few parenchyma cells from a carrot gave rise to this callus, a mass of undifferentiated cells. (b) The callus differentiates into an entire plant, with leaves, stems, and roots. (See FIGURE 21.5)

Plant tissue culture also facilitates genetic engineering in plants. Most techniques for the introduction of foreign genes into plants require the use of small pieces of plant tissue or single plant cells as the starting material. Test-tube culture makes it possible to regenerate genetically modified (transgenic) plants from a single plant cell into which the foreign DNA has been incorporated. For example, researchers have used recombinant DNA technology to transfer a gene for bean protein into cultured cells from a sunflower plant. The experiment improved the protein quality of sunflower seeds harvested from the transgenic plants. Firing DNA-coated pellets from a gun is one method researchers use to insert foreign DNA into plant cells (FIGURE 38.17). The techniques of genetic engineering are discussed in more detail in Chapter 20.

Some researchers are coupling a technique known as protoplast fusion with tissue culture methods to actually invent new plant varieties that can be cloned. Protoplasts are plant cells that have had their cell walls enzymatically removed by treatment with cell-wall-degrading enzymes (cellulases and pectinases) isolated from fungi (FIGURE 38.18). Before they are cultured, the protoplasts can be screened for mutations that may improve the agricultural value of the plant. It is also possible in some cases to fuse two protoplasts from different plant species that would otherwise be reproductively incompatible, and then culture the hybrid protoplasts. Each of the many protoplasts can regenerate a wall and eventually form a hybrid plantlet. One success of this method has been a hybrid between a potato and a wild relative called black nightshade. The nightshade is resistant to an herbicide that is commonly used to kill weeds. The hybrids are also resistant, and this makes it possible to "weed" a potato field with the herbicide without killing the potato plants.

Researchers can fuse protoplasts from different species to make hybrids and can also culture the hybrid cells to produce a new plant.

The in vitro culturing of plant cells and tissues is fundamental to most types of plant biotechnology. The other basic process behind modern plant biotechnology is the ability to produce transgenic plants through various methods of genetic engineering. In this chapter's last section, we take a closer look at plant biotechnology.





 Neolithic humans created new plant varieties by artificial selection

Humans have intervened in the reproduction and genetic makeup of plants for thousands of years. It is no exaggeration to say that maize is an unnatural monster created by humans. Left on its own in nature, maize would soon become extinct for the simple reason that it cannot spread its seeds. Maize kernels not only are permanently attached to the central axis (the "cob") but also are permanently protected by tough, overlapping leaf sheathes (the "husk"). Obviously, these attributes, so useful to people, arose not by natural selection but by artificial selection by humans (FIGURE 38.19). (See Chapter 22 to review the basic concept of artificial selection.) Indeed, Neolithic (late Stone Age) humans domesticated virtually all of our crop species over a relatively short period about 10,000 years ago. But genetic modification began long before humans started altering crops by artificial selection. For example, the wheat groups we rely on for much of our food supply are the result of natural hybridization between different species of grasses. Such hybridization is common in plants, and has long been exploited by plant breeders to introduce additional genetic variation for artificial selection and crop improvement. Let's consider one modern example, the selective breeding of maize.

Fig 38-19. Maize: a product of artificial selection. Modern maize (bottom) was derived from teosinte (top). Teosinte kernels are tiny, and each one has a husk that must be removed to get at the kernel. The cob shatters during seed dispersal, which probably made harvesting difficult for early farmers. Neolithic farmers selected for larger cob and kernel size as well as the permanent attachment of seeds to the cob and the encasing of the entire cob by a tough husk.

Maize is a major staple in many developing countries. Nevertheless, the most common varieties are relatively poor sources of protein, thus requiring that diets be supplemented with other protein sources such as beans. The proteins that are stored in these popular maize varieties are very low in lysine and tryptophan, two of the eight essential amino acids that humans cannot synthesize and must obtain from their diet (see FIGURE 41.4). Forty years ago, researchers discovered a mutant maize known as opaque-2 that had much higher levels of lysine and tryptophan. But, as is often the case in plant breeding, a highly desirable trait turned out to be closely associated with several undesirable ones. The opaque-2 maize kernels have a soft endosperm that makes them difficult to harvest and more vulnerable to attack by pests. But, of course, this maize variety is more nutritious. Swine fed with opaque-2 maize gain weight three times faster than those fed with normal maize. Using the conventional breeding methods of hybridization and artificial selection, plant breeders were able to convert the original soft opaque-2 endosperm into a more desirable hard endosperm type. This transition took nearly 20 years. Had modern methods of genetic engineering been available then, the genes responsible for the high lysine and tryptophan condition could have been inserted directly into hard-endosperm maize varieties.

Unlike traditional plant breeders, modern plant biotechnologists, using the techniques of genetic engineering, are not limited solely to the transfer of genes between closely related species or varieties of the same species. For example, traditional plant breeding techniques could not be used to insert a desired gene from daffodil into rice, but genetic engineering makes this possible. The term transgenic is used to describe organisms that have been genetically engineered to express a foreign gene from another species. The reason that traditional plant breeders cannot introduce daffodil genes into rice is that the many intermediate species between rice and daffodil and their common ancestor are extinct. In theory, if plant breeders did have the intermediate species at their disposal, they could, probably over the course of several centuries, introduce a daffodil gene into rice by traditional hybridization and breeding methods. With genetic engineering technology, this gene transfer can be accomplished without the need for intermediate species.





 Biotechnology is transforming agriculture

Eight hundred million people on earth suffer from nutritional deficiencies. Forty thousand people die each day of malnutrition, half of them children. Disagreements exist over the causes of such hunger. Some argue that food shortages arise not from a lack of food production but from inequities in distribution: The dire poor simply cannot afford food. Others regard food shortages as evidence that the world is overpopulated--that the human species has exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet (see Chapter 52). Whatever the social and demographic causes of starvation, increasing food production seems like a humane objective. Because land and water are the most limiting resources for food production, the best option will be to increase yields on the available land. Indeed, there is very little "extra" land that can be put to the plow, especially if the few remaining pockets of wilderness are to be conserved. Based on conservative estimates of population growth, the world's farmers will have to produce 40%  more grain per hectare to feed the human population in 2020. Plant biotechnology could help make these crop yields possible.

Already, the commercial adoption by farmers of transgenic crops has been one of the most rapid cases of technology transfer in the history of agriculture. Between 1996 and 1999, the area planted commercially with transgenic crops increased from 1.7 to 39.9 million hectares. These crops include transgenic varieties and hybrids of cotton, maize, and potatoes that contain genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. These "transgenes" encode for a protein (Bt toxin) that effectively controls a number of serious insect pests. The use of such plant varieties greatly reduces the need for spraying crops with chemical insecticides. Considerable progress also has been made in the development of transgenic plants of cotton, maize, soybeans, sugar beet, and wheat that are tolerant to a number of herbicides. The cultivation of these plants could lower production costs and enable farmers to "weed" crops with herbicides (which won't damage the transgenic crop plants) instead of by heavy tillage, which can cause erosion of soil. Researchers are also engineering transgenic plants with enhanced resistance to disease. In one case, a transgenic papaya resistant to a ringspot virus was introduced into Hawaii, thereby saving the papaya industry (FIGURE 38.20). The nutritional quality of plants is also being improved. "Golden Rice," a transgenic variety with a few daffodil genes that increase quantities of vitamin A, was specifically designed to prevent the blindness that develops in many of the world's poor whose diet is chronically deficient in vitamin A (see FIGURE 20.20).

 Plant biotechnology has incited much public debate

Many people, including some scientists, are concerned about the unknown risks associated with the release of GM organisms into the environment. Much of the animosity regarding GM organisms in agriculture is political, economic, or ethical in nature, and outside the scope of this book. But we should consider the biological concerns about GM crops. The most fundamental debate centers on the extent to which GM organisms are an unknown risk that could potentially cause harm to human health or to the environment. Those who want to proceed more slowly with agricultural biotechnology, or stop it entirely, are concerned about the unstoppable nature of the "experiment." If a drug trial produces unanticipated harmful results, the trial is stopped: We cannot stop the "trial" of novel organisms that have been introduced into the biosphere. Chapter 20 introduced the key concerns. Here, we take a closer look at a few of the controversies surrounding plant biotechnology in agriculture.

One of the specific concerns is that genetic engineering could potentially transfer allergens, which are molecules to which some humans are allergic, from a gene source to a plant used for food. So far, there is no credible evidence that any GM plants specifically designed for human consumption have had any adverse effect on human health. Nevertheless, because of these health concerns, activists continue to lobby for the clear labeling of all foods made wholly or in part from products of GM organisms. Some activists also argue for strict regulations against the mixing of GM foods with non-GM foods during food transport, storage, and processing. Some biotechnology advocates, however, point out that similar demands were not raised when "transgenic" crops produced by traditional plant breeding techniques were put on the market. For example, triticale, a completely new crop, was artificially synthesized a few decades ago by combining the genomes of wheat and rye--two distinct genera that do not interbreed in nature. Triticale is now grown on over three million acres worldwide.

Many environmentalists are concerned that the growing of GM crops might have unforeseen effects on nontarget organisms. One recent study indicated that the larvae (caterpillars) of monarch butterflies responded adversely and even died following their consumption in the laboratory of milkweed leaves (their preferred food) heavily dusted with pollen from transgenic maize that produces the Bt toxin. This effect is not too surprising if one considers that Bt toxin was engineered into crop plants specifically because it is toxic to pests closely related to monarchs. Debate about this specific issue now centers on just how big an effect Bt maize pollen has on monarchs in nature, in contrast to the extreme exposure to the Bt toxin in the laboratory experiments. Maize pollen is produced for only a short time during the growing season, and most of it is not wind-dispersed too far from the field. A recent study provided evidence that only those milkweed plants bordering a maize field would potentially be dusted heavily enough with Bt pollen to adversely affect nontarget larvae. Moreover, in considering the negative effects of Bt pollen on monarch butterflies, one must also weigh the effects of the most likely alternative to the cultivation of Bt maize--the spraying of non-Bt maize with chemical pesticides. Such spraying may be even more harmful to the nearby monarch population.

Perhaps the most serious concern that some scientists raise about GM crops is the possibility of the introduced genes escaping from a transgenic crop into related weeds through crop-to-weed hybridization. Perhaps, for example, spontaneous hybridization between a crop engineered for herbicide resistance and a wild relative might give rise to a "superweed" that would be much more difficult to control. Crop-to-weed transgene escape does occur. Its likelihood depends on the ability of the crop and weed to hybridize and on how the transgenes affect the overall fitness of the hybrids. In some cases, a desirable crop trait--a dwarf phenotype, for example--would be disadvantageous to a weed growing in the wild. In other instances, there are no weedy relatives nearby with which to hybridize; soybean, for example, has no wild relatives in the United States. However, many crops, such as cabbage and broccoli, are members of the mustard family and hybridize readily with wild mustard (generally considered to be a weed). In such cases, the planting of nontransgenic plant borders around fields of transgenic crops can help to "brush" the pollen off insect pollinators, thereby reducing crop-to-weed gene transfer. Efforts are also under way to breed male sterility into transgenic crops. These plants will still produce seeds and fruit if they are pollinated by nearby nontransgenic bisexual plants, but they will produce no viable pollen of their own. Another approach is to engineer the transgene into the chloroplast DNA of the crop; chloroplast DNA is inherited strictly from the maternal plant, so transgenes in the chloroplast cannot be transferred by pollen.

The continuing debate about GM organisms in agriculture exemplifies one of this textbook's themes: the relationships of science and technology to society. Technological advances almost always involve some risk that unintended outcomes could occur. In the case of plant biotechnology, zero risk is unrealistic and probably unattainable. Scientists and the public need to assess the possible benefits of transgenic products versus the risks society is willing to take on a case-by-case basis. The best scenario would be for these discussions and decisions to be based on sound scientific information and testing rather than on reflexive fear or blind optimism.

At every stage in the life of a plant, sensitivity to the environment and coordination of responses are evident. One part of a plant can send signals to other parts. For example, the terminal bud at the apex of a shoot is able to suppress the growth of axillary buds that may be many meters away. Plants keep track of the time of day and the time of year. They can sense gravity and the direction of light. For example, the grass seedling in the photograph on this page is growing toward light. A plant's morphology and physiology are constantly tuned to its variable surroundings by complex interactions between environmental stimuli and internal signals.

This chapter focuses on how plants respond to these external and internal cues. At the organismal level, plants and animals respond to environmental stimuli by very different means. Animals, being mobile, respond mainly by behavioral mechanisms, moving toward positive stimuli and away from negative stimuli. Rooted to one location for life, a plant generally responds to environmental cues by adjusting its pattern of growth and development. For this reason, plants of the same species vary in body form much more than do animals of the same species. All lions have four limbs and approximately the same body proportions, but oak trees vary considerably in their number of limbs and their shapes. But at the cellular level, plants, animals, and all other eukaryotes are surprisingly similar in their signaling mechanisms. We begin our study of plant response with the role of signal transduction in plant cells.





SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND PLANT RESPONSES

 

 Signal-transduction pathways link internal and environmental signals to cellular responses



All organisms, including plants, have the ability to receive specific environmental and internal signals and respond to them in ways that enhance survival and reproductive success. Bees, which possess UV-sensitive photoreceptors in their eyes, can discern nectar-guiding patterns on flower petals--patterns that are completely invisible to humans. A dog sniffing a fire hydrant receives information about its olfactory world, the nature of which we, with our inferior sense of smell, can only surmise. Plants, too, have cellular receptors that they use to detect important changes in their environment, whether the change is an increase in the concentration of a growth hormone, an injury from a caterpillar munching on leaves, or a decrease in day length as winter approaches.

In order for an internal or external stimulus to elicit a physiological response, certain cells within the organism must possess an appropriate receptor, a molecule that is sensitive to and affected by the specific stimulus. For example, our blindness to UV-reflecting floral patterns is due to our eyes lacking the necessary UV photoreceptors. Upon receiving a stimulus, a receptor initiates a specific series of biochemical steps, a signal transduction pathway, which couples reception of the stimulus to the response of the organism. As you will learn, plants are sensitive to a wide range of internal and external stimuli, and each of these stimuli initiates a specific signal transduction pathway. We introduced general concepts of signal transduction in cells in Chapter 11. Here, we apply those concepts to specific examples in plants.





PLANT RESPONSES TO HORMONES

 

 Research on how plants grow toward light led to the discovery of plant hormones



 

 Plant hormones help coordinate growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli



The word hormone is derived from a Greek verb meaning "to excite." Found in all multicellular organisms, hormones are chemical signals that coordinate the parts of the organism. By definition, a hormone is a compound that is produced by one part of the body and then transported to other parts of the body, where it binds to a specific receptor and triggers responses in target cells and tissues. Another important characteristic of hormones is that only minute amounts are required to induce substantial change in an organism. Hormone concentrations or the rates of their transport can change in response to environmental stimuli. Often the response of a plant is governed by the interaction of two or more hormones.

 Phytochromes function as photoreceptors in many plant responses to light



 

 Biological clocks control circadian rhythms in plants and other eukaryotes



 

 Light entrains the biological clock



 

 Photoperiodism synchronizes many plant responses to changes of season



Light is an especially important environmental factor in the lives of plants. In addition to being required for photosynthesis, light also cues many key events in plant growth and development. These effects of light on plant morphology are what plant biologists call photomorphogenesis. Light reception is also important in allowing plants to measure the passage of days and seasons.

Plants detect not just the presence of light, but also its direction, intensity, and wavelengths (colors). Recall from Chapter 10 that an action spectrum is a graph that relates physiological response to wavelength of light. The action spectrum for photosynthesis, for example, has two peaks, one in the red and one in the blue (see FIGURE 10.8). This is because chlorophyll absorbs light primarily in the red and blue portions of the visible spectrum. Action spectra, however, are useful in the study of any process that depends on light. By comparing action spectra of different plant responses researchers can determine which responses are mediated by the same photoreceptor (pigment). Scientists can also compare action spectra to the absorption spectra of putative photoreceptor molecules. An absorption spectrum is a graph profiling the wavelengths of light a particular pigment absorbs. A close correspondence between an action spectrum of a plant response and the absorption spectrum of a purified pigment suggests that the pigment may be the photoreceptor involved in mediating the response.

Action spectra reveal that red and blue light are the most important colors in regulating a plant's photomorphogenesis. These observations led researchers to two major classes of light receptors: a heterogeneous group of blue-light photoreceptors and a family of photoreceptors called phytochromes that absorb mostly red light.





PLANT RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI OTHER THAN LIGHT

 

 Plants respond to environmental stimuli through a combination of developmental and physiological mechanisms



Plants can neither migrate to a watering hole when water is scarce nor seek shelter when the weather is too windy. A seed, landing upside down in the soil, cannot maneuver itself into an upright position. Because of their immobility, plants must adjust to a wide range of environmental circumstances through developmental and physiological mechanisms. Natural selection has refined these responses. Light is so important in the life of a plant that we devoted the entire previous section to a plant's reception of and response to this one environmental factor. In this section, we examine responses to some of the other environmental stimuli that a plant commonly faces in its "struggle for existence."





PLANT DEFENSE: RESPONSES TO HERBIVORES AND PATHOGENS

 

 Plants deter herbivores with both physical and chemical defenses



 

 Plants use multiple lines of defense against pathogens



Plants do not exist in isolation, but interact with many other species in their communities. Some of these interspecific interactions--for example, the associations of plants with fungi in mycorrhizae (see Chapter 37) or with insect pollinators (see Chapter 38)--are mutually beneficial. Most of the interactions that plants have with other organisms, however, are not beneficial to the plant. As primary producers, plants are at the base of most food webs and are subject to attack by a wide range of plant-eating (herbivorous) animals. A plant is also subject to infection by a diversity of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi that have the potential to damage tissues or even kill the plant. Plants counter these threats with defense systems that deter herbivory and prevent infection or combat pathogens that do manage to infect the plant.





 Signal-transduction pathways link internal and environmental signals to cellular responses

In the back corner of a food cabinet, a long forgotten potato (a modified underground stem, or tuber) has sprouted shoots from its "eyes" (axillary buds). These shoots, however, scarcely resemble those of a typical plant. Instead of broad green leaves and sturdy stems, these dark-sprouted shoots are ghostly pale, have stems that are long and thin, bear leaves that are unexpanded, and give rise to roots that are reduced (FIGURE 39.1a). Seedlings germinated in the dark have a similar appearance. These morphological adaptations for growing in darkness make sense if we consider that a potato or a seedling, in nature, usually encounters continuous darkness when sprouting underground. In such circumstances, the pre-emergent plant is supported by the surrounding soil and would not benefit from a thick stem. Expanded leaves would be a hindrance to soil penetration and would be damaged as the shoots pushed upward. Because the leaves are unexpanded, there is little evaporative loss of water, and little requirement for an extensive root system to replace the water lost by transpiration. The energy expended in producing green chlorophyll would be wasted since there is no light for photosynthesis. Rather, a plant growing in the dark allocates as much energy as possible to the elongation of stems. This "strategy" enables the shoots to break ground before the stored food reserves in the tuber or seed are exhausted.

Fig 39-1. Light-induced greening of dark-sprouted potatoes. (a) A dark-grown potato has tall, spindly stems and nonexpanded leaves--a morphological adaptation that enables the shoots to penetrate the soil. The roots are short, but little water is lost by the shoots. (b) After a week's exposure to natural daylight, the potato plant begins to resemble a typical plant with broad green leaves, short sturdy stems, and long roots. This transformation begins with the reception of light by a specific pigment

Once a shoot reaches the sunlight, its morphology and biochemistry undergo profound changes collectively called greening: the elongation rate of the stems slows, the leaves expand, the roots start to elongate, and the entire shoot begins to produce chlorophyll; in short, it begins to resemble a typical plant (FIGURE 39.1b). In the following discussion, we use this greening response as an example of how a plant cell receives a signal--in this case, light--and how this reception is transduced into a response (greening). Along the way we will explore how studies of mutants have provided valuable insights into the roles played by various molecules in the three stages of cell-signal processing: reception, transduction, and response (FIGURE 39.2).

Fig 39-2. Review of a general model for signal-transduction pathways. A hormone or other signal binding to a specific receptor stimulates the cell to produce second messengers. Second messengers trigger the cell's various responses to the original signal. In this diagram, the receptor is on the surface of the target cell. In other cases, hormones enter cells and bind to specific receptors inside.

Reception

Signals, whether internal or external, are first detected by receptors, proteins that undergo conformational changes in response to a specific stimulus. The receptor involved in greening in plants is called phytochrome, which consists of a light-absorbing pigment attached to a specific protein. Unlike many receptors, which are built into the plasma membrane, the phytochrome that functions in greening occurs in the cytoplasm. Researchers have demonstrated the requirement for phytochrome in greening through studies of a tomato mutant called aurea. The mutant, which has lower-than-normal levels of phytochrome, greens less than wild-type tomatoes when exposed to light. (The name aurea comes from the Latin for "gold-colored." In the absence of chlorophyll, the yellow plant pigments called carotenoids are more obvious.) Researchers were able to produce a normal greening response by using a microneedle to inject phytochrome extracted from other plants into aurea leaf cells and then exposing the aurea to light. Such experiments support the hypothesis that phytochrome functions in light detection in the greening process.

Transduction

The greening response is triggered by extremely low levels of light. For example, light levels equivalent to a few seconds of moonlight are sufficient to cause a slowing of stem elongation in dark-grown oat seedlings. Receptors such as phytochrome are sensitive to very weak environmental and chemical signals. How is the information from these extremely weak signals amplified, and how is their reception transduced into a specific response by the plant? The answer is second messengers--small, internally produced chemicals that transfer and amplify the signal from the receptor to proteins that cause the specific response. In the greening response, for example, each activated phytochrome may give rise to hundreds of molecules of a second messenger, each of which, in turn, may lead to the activation of hundreds of molecules of a specific enzyme. By such mechanisms, the second messenger of a signal transduction pathway leads to a rapid amplification of the signal. In Chapter 11, we examined this role of second messengers in general (see FIGURE 11.12). Here, let's specifically consider the production of second messengers and their function in the greening response (FIGURE 39.3). Refer to the diagram frequently as you read the text description of this complex process.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 39-3. An example of signal transduction in plants: the role of phytochrome in the greening response. The light signal is detected by the phytochrome receptor, which then activates at least two signal-transduction pathways involving G-proteins. 
			  
		 One pathway leads to cGMP as a second messenger that activates a protein kinase cascade (see FIGURE 11.11). 
			  
		 The other pathway leads to formation of a Ca2+1-calmodulin complex that activates a specific protein kinase. 
			  
		 Both pathways lead to expression of genes for the proteins that function in the greening response. We do not present such a complex diagram because its details are important for you to remember. The main point of this diagram: Signal transduction pathways in plants are variations of the general schemes you learned about in Chapter 11, involving such components as G-proteins, second messengers, and protein kinases.

As we discussed in Chapter 11, many receptors interact with guanine-binding proteins (G-proteins). Phytochrome is such a receptor. Light causes phytochrome to undergo a conformational change, and the phytochrome then interacts with a specific G-protein. During activation, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) that is bound to the inactive G-protein is displaced by guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The G-protein, now in its active form, in turn activates other enzymes in the signal-transduction pathway that leads to greening. For example, phytochrome-activated G-proteins activate guanyl cyclase, the enzyme that produces cyclic GMP, a second messenger. In aurea tomato cells, G-protein inhibitors such as cholera toxin block greening after microinjection of phytochrome, whereas G-protein activators such as pertussis toxin stimulate the response.

The cyclic nucleotides are second messengers that include cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP). In some cases, cyclic nucleotides activate specific protein kinases (enzymes that phosphorylate and activate other proteins--see FIGURE 11.11). Experiments indicate that cyclic GMP (cGMP) is involved in the greening process. The microinjection of cGMP into aurea tomato cells induces a partial greening response, even without addition of phytochrome.

Changes in cytosolic Ca+ also play an important role in phytochrome signal transduction. The levels of Ca+ are generally very low in the cytosol (about 10-7M). However, a wide range of hormonal and environmental stimuli can cause brief increases in cytosolic Ca+. In many cases, Ca2+ then binds directly to small proteins called calmodulins. The Ca+-calmodulin complex then binds to and activates several enzymes, most notably certain types of protein kinases. Note in FIGURE 39.3 that phytochrome activation during the greening mechanism results in both cGMP and Ca+-calmodulin as second messengers.

Response

Ultimately, a signal-transduction pathway leads to the regulation of one or more cellular activities. In most cases, especially when changes in development are involved, these responses to stimulation involve the increased activity of certain enzymes. The two main mechanisms by which a signaling pathway can activate an enzyme are by stimulating transcription of mRNA for the enzyme or by activating existing enzyme molecules (post-translational modification).

Transcriptional Regulation.Transcription factors bind directly to specific regions of DNA and control the transcription of specific genes (see FIGURE 19.8). In the case of phytochrome-induced greening, several transcription factors are activated by phosphorylation in response to the appropriate light conditions. The activation of some of these transcription factors depends upon cyclic GMP, whereas the activation of others requires Ca+-calmodulin.

The mechanism by which a signal promotes a new developmental course may depend on the activation of positive transcriptional factors (proteins that increase transcription of specific genes) or the deactivation of negative transcriptional factors (proteins that decrease transcription), or both. For example, there are Arabidopsis mutants that, except for their pale color, have a light-grown morphology (expanded leaves and short, sturdy stems) when grown in the dark (they are not green because the final step in chlorophyll production requires direct light). These mutants have defects in a negative transcriptional factor that inhibits the expression of other genes normally activated by light. When the negative factor is eliminated by mutation, the pathway that it normally blocks becomes activated: hence, these mutants, except for their pale color, appear to have been grown in the light.

Post-Translational Modification of Proteins.Although the synthesis of new proteins by transcription and translation are important molecular events associated with greening, so are post-translational modifications of existing proteins. Most often these existing proteins are modified by phosphorylation, the addition of a phosphate group onto the protein. The diverse proteins called protein kinases catalyze this phosphorylation of target proteins (see FIGURE 11.11). Many second messengers, such as cGMP, and some receptors themselves, including some forms of phytochrome, activate protein kinases directly. About 2-3%  of all plant genes may encode for protein kinases. Often one protein kinase will phosphorylate another protein kinase, which then phosphorylates another, and so on. Such kinase cascades may eventually link initial stimuli to responses at the level of gene expression, usually via the phosphorylation of transcription factors. By such mechanisms, many signal pathways ultimately regulate the synthesis of new proteins, usually by turning specific genes on or off (FIGURE 39.3).

Signal pathways must also have a means for turning off once the initial signal is no longer present--for example, what if we put the potato back into the cupboard? Protein phosphatases, enzymes that dephosphorylate specific proteins, are involved in these "switch-off" processes. At any given moment, the activities of a cell depend upon the balance of activity of many types of protein kinases and protein phosphatases.

The Greening Proteins.What sorts of proteins are either newly transcibed or activated by phosphorylation during the greening process? Many are enzymes that function in photosynthesis directly; others are enzymes involved in supplying the chemical precursors necessary for chlorophyll production; still others affect the levels of plant hormones that regulate growth. For example, the levels of two hormones that enhance stem elongation will decrease following phytochrome activation--hence, the reduction in stem elongation that accompanies greening.

We have discussed the signal transduction involved in the greening response of a potato in some detail to give you a sense of the complexity of biochemical changes that underlie this one process. As you read on, keep in mind that every plant hormone and every environmental stimulus triggers one or more signal transduction pathways of comparable complexity. As we have seen in the case of the tomato mutant aurea, the techniques of molecular biology combined with studies of mutants are helping researchers elucidate these various pathways. But molecular biology builds upon a long history of careful physiological and biochemical investigations into how plants work. Indeed, as you will read in the next section, it was classical observations and experiments that provided biologists with the first clue that chemical signals--hormones--serve as internal regulators of plant growth and development.





 Research on how plants grow toward light led to the discovery of plant hormones

The concept of chemical messengers in plants emerged from a series of classic experiments on how stems respond to light. A houseplant on a windowsill grows toward light. If you rotate the plant, it will soon reorient its growth until its leaves again face the window. Any growth response that results in curvatures of whole plant organs toward or away from stimuli is called a tropism (from the Greek tropos, turn). The growth of a shoot toward light is called positive phototropism (growth away from light is negative phototropism).

In a forest or other natural ecosystem where plants may be crowded, phototropism directs growing seedlings toward the sunlight that powers photosynthesis. What is the mechanism for this adaptive response? Much of what is known about phototropism has been learned from studies of grass seedlings, particularly oats. The shoot of a grass seedling is enclosed in a sheath called the coleoptile, which grows straight upward if the seedling is kept in the dark or if it is illuminated uniformly from all sides. If the growing coleoptile is illuminated from one side, it will curve toward the light (see the photograph that opens the chapter). This response results from a differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the coleoptile; the cells on the darker side elongate faster than the cells on the brighter side.

Charles Darwin and his son, Francis, conducted some of the earliest experiments on phototropism in the late 19th century. They observed that a grass seedling could bend toward light only if the tip of the coleoptile was present (FIGURE 39.4). If the tip was removed, the coleoptile would not curve. The seedling would also fail to grow toward light if the tip was covered with an opaque cap; neither a transparent cap over the tip nor an opaque shield placed farther down the coleoptile prevented the phototropic response. It was the tip of the coleoptile, the Darwins concluded, that was responsible for sensing light. However, the actual growth response, the curvature of the coleoptile, occurred some distance below the tip. The Darwins postulated that some signal was transmitted downward from the tip to the elongating region of the coleoptile. A few decades later, Peter Boysen-Jensen of Denmark tested this hypothesis and demonstrated that the signal was a mobile chemical substance. He separated the tip from the remainder of the coleoptile by a block of gelatin, which would prevent cellular contact but allow chemicals to pass. These seedlings behaved normally, bending toward light. However, if the tip was experimentally segregated from the lower coleoptile by an impermeable barrier, no phototropic response occurred.

Fig 39-4. Early experiments of phototropism. Only the tip of the coleoptile can sense the direction of light, but the bending response occurs some distance below the tip. A signal of some kind must travel downward from the tip. The signal can pass through a permeable barrier (gelatin block) but not through a solid barrier (a mineral called mica), suggesting that the signal for phototropism is a mobile chemical.

In 1926, F. W. Went, a Dutch graduate student, extracted the chemical messenger for phototropism by modifying the experiments of Boysen-Jensen (FIGURE 39.5). Went removed the coleoptile tip and placed it on a block of agar, a gelatinous material. The chemical messenger from the tip, Went reasoned, should diffuse into the agar, and the agar block should then be able to substitute for the coleoptile tip. Went placed the agar blocks on decapitated coleoptiles that were kept in the dark. A block that was centered on top of the coleoptile caused the stem to grow straight upward. However, if the block was placed off center, then the coleoptile began to bend away from the side with the agar block, as though growing toward light. Went concluded that the agar block contained a chemical produced in the coleoptile tip, that this chemical stimulated growth as it passed down the coleoptile, and that a coleoptile curved toward light because of a higher concentration of the growth-promoting chemical on the darker side of the coleoptile. For this chemical messenger, or hormone, Went chose the name auxin (from the Greek auxein, to increase). Auxin was later purified and its structure determined by Kenneth Thimann and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology.

Fig 39-5. The Went experiments. Some chemical (indicated by pink) that can pass into an agar block from a coleoptile tip stimulates elongation of the coleoptile when the block is substituted for a tip. If the block is placed off-center on the top of a decapitated coleoptile kept in the dark, the organ bends as if responding to illumination from one side. The chemical is the hormone auxin, which stimulates elongation of cells in the shoot.

The classical hypothesis for what causes grass coleoptiles to grow toward light, based on the work of the Darwins and Went, is that an asymmetrical distribution of auxin moving down from the coleoptile tip causes cells on the darker side to elongate faster than cells on the brighter side. However, studies of phototropism by organs other than grass coleoptiles provide less support for this idea. For example, there is no evidence that unilateral light causes an asymmetrical distribution of auxin in the stems of sunflowers, radishes, and other dicots. There is, however, an asymmetrical distribution of certain substances that may act as growth inhibitors, with these substances more concentrated on the lighted side of a stem. Still, the specific case of auxin's role in the phototropism of grass coleoptiles opened up the whole field of research on plant hormones.





 Plant hormones help coordinate growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli

TABLE 39.1 previews some of the major classes of plant hormones: auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, ethylene, and brassinosteroids. Many of the molecules that function in defense of the plant against pathogens are probably plant hormones as well. (These molecules will be discussed later in the chapter.) Notice that all of the hormones shown in TABLE 39.1 are relatively small molecules. Their transport from cell to cell often involves passage across cell walls, a pathway that blocks the movement of large molecules.

		Seeds, fruits, shoots, leaves, and floral budsInhibits root growth; retards leaf abscission; promotes xylem differentiationIn general, hormones control plant growth and development by affecting the division, elongation, and differentiation of cells. Some hormones also mediate shorter-term physiological responses of plants to environmental stimuli. Each hormone has multiple effects, depending on its site of action, its concentration, and the developmental stage of the plant.

Plant hormones are produced in very low concentrations, but a minute amount of hormone can have a profound effect on the growth and development of a plant organ. This implies that the hormonal signal must be amplified in some way. A hormone may act by altering the expression of genes, by affecting the activity of existing enzymes, or by changing properties of membranes. Any of these actions could redirect the metabolism and development of a cell responding to a small number of hormone molecules. Signal transduction pathways amplify the hormonal signal and connect it to a cell's specific responses.

Response to a hormone usually depends not so much on the absolute amount of that hormone as on its relative concentration compared with other hormones. It is hormonal balance, rather than hormones acting in isolation, that may control the growth and development of the plant. These interactions will become apparent in the following survey of hormone function.

Auxin

The term auxin is used for any chemical substance that promotes the elongation of coleoptiles, although auxins actually have multiple functions in both monocots and dicots. The natural auxin occurring in plants is indoleacetic acid, or IAA, but several other compounds, including some synthetic ones, have auxin activity. Throughout this chapter, however, the name auxin is used specifically to refer to IAA. Although auxin was the first plant hormone to be discovered, much remains to be learned about auxin signal transduction and the regulation of auxin biosynthesis. Current evidence suggests that auxin is produced from the amino acid tryptophan in the shoot tips of plants.

The speed at which auxin is transported down the stem from the shoot apex is about 10 mm per hour--much too fast for diffusion, although slower than translocation in phloem. Auxin seems to be transported directly through parenchyma tissue, from one cell to the next. It moves only from shoot tip to base, not in the reverse direction. This unidirectional transport of auxin is called polar transport. Polar transport has nothing to do with gravity, for auxin travels upward in experiments where a stem or coleoptile segment is placed upside down. Polar auxin transport requires energy. FIGURE 39.6 illustrates how proton pumps in the plasma membrane, driven by ATP, couple metabolic energy to auxin transport. The mechanism of polar auxin transport is another example of cellular work driven by chemiosmosis, the harnessing of H+ gradients generated by proton pumps (see Chapter 9).

Although auxin affects several aspects of plant development, one of its chief functions is to stimulate the elongation of cells in young developing shoots.

The Role of Auxin in Cell Elongation.The apical meristem of a shoot is a major site of auxin synthesis. As auxin from the shoot apex moves down to the region of cell elongation (see Chapter 35), the hormone stimulates growth of the cells, probably by binding to a receptor built into the plasma membrane. Auxin stimulates growth only over a certain concentration range, from about 10-8 to 10-4M. At higher concentrations, auxin may inhibit cell elongation, probably by inducing the production of ethylene, a hormone that generally acts as an inhibitor of elongation. We will return to this hormonal interaction in the discussion of ethylene.

According to a proposal called the acid growth hypothesis, proton pumps play a major role in the growth response of cells to auxin. In a shoot's region of elongation, auxin stimulates plasma membrane proton pumps, an action that, within minutes, both increases the voltage across the membrane (membrane potential) and lowers the pH in the cell wall (FIGURE 39.7). The acidification of the wall activates enzymes called expansins that break the cross-links (hydrogen bonds) between cellulose microfibrils, loosening the fabric of the wall. (Expansins can even weaken the integrity of filter paper made of pure cellulose.) Increasing the membrane potential enhances ion uptake into the cell, which causes the osmotic uptake of water. The uptake of water, along with the increased plasticity of the walls, enables the cell to elongate.

Auxin also alters gene expression rapidly, causing cells in the region of elongation to produce new proteins within minutes. Some of these proteins are short-lived transcription factors that repress or activate the expression of other genes. For sustained growth after this initial spurt, cells must make more cytoplasm and wall material. Auxin also stimulates this sustained growth response.

Lateral and Adventitious Root Formation.Auxins are used commercially in the vegetative propagation of plants by cuttings. Treating a detached leaf or stem with rooting powder containing auxin often causes adventitious roots to form near the cut surface. Auxin is also involved in the branching of roots. Researchers found that an Arabidopsis mutant that exhibits extreme proliferation of lateral roots has an auxin concentration 17-fold higher than normal.

Auxins as Herbicides.Synthetic auxins, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-D), are widely used as herbicides. Monocots, such as maize and turfgrass, can rapidly inactivate these synthetic auxins, but dicots cannot, and die from a hormonal overdose. Spraying cereal fields or turf with 2,4-D eliminates dicot (broadleaf) weeds such as dandelions.

Other Effects of Auxin.In addition to stimulating cell elongation for primary growth, auxin affects secondary growth by inducing cell division in the vascular cambium and by influencing the differentiation of secondary xylem (see Chapter 35). Developing seeds synthesize auxin, which promotes the growth of fruits in plants. Synthetic auxins sprayed on tomato vines induce fruit development without a need for pollination. This makes it possible to grow seedless tomatoes by substituting synthetic auxin for the auxin normally synthesized by the developing seeds.

Cytokinins

Trial-and-error attempts to find chemical additives that would enhance the growth and development of plant cells in tissue culture led to the discovery of cytokinins. In the 1940s, Johannes van Overbeek, working at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, found he could stimulate the growth of plant embryos by adding coconut milk, the liquid endosperm of a coconut's giant seed, to his culture medium. A decade later, Folke Skoog and Carlos O. Miller, at the University of Wisconsin, induced cultured tobacco cells to divide by adding degraded samples of DNA. The active ingredients of both experimental additives turned out to be modified forms of adenine, one of the components of nucleic acids. These growth regulators were named cytokinins because they stimulate cytokinesis, or cell division. Of the variety of cytokinins that occur naturally in plants, the most common is zeatin, so named because it was first discovered in maize (Zea mays).

Despite much effort, the enzyme that produces cytokinins has neither been purified from plants nor has the gene that encodes for it been identified. Mark Holland of Salisbury State University has proposed that plants may not even produce their own cytokinins: His hypothesis is that cytokinins are actually produced by prokaryotes called methylobacteria that live symbiotically inside actively growing plant tissues, even in in vitro cultures. Indeed, normal developmental processes are impaired when methylobacteria are eliminated, and these processes can be restored either by the reapplication of methylobacteria or the addition of cytokinins. Regardless of whether this provocative hypothesis gains support, the issue underscores the importance of genomic sequencing. Now that the sequencing of Arabidopsis is complete, the gene for a cytokinin-producing enzyme, if present, should be more easily identified.

Regardless of the source of cytokinins, plant cells do have cytokinin receptors. Some evidence points to the existence of two entirely different classes of cytokinin receptors, one intracellular and the other on the cell surface. The cytoplasmic receptor binds cytokinins directly and can stimulate transcription in isolated nuclei. In some plant cells, cytokinins open Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, causing an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Although much remains to be learned about cytokinin synthesis and signal transduction, some of the major effects that cytokinins have on the physiology and development of plants are well documented.

Control of Cell Division and Differentiation.Cytokinins are produced in actively growing tissues, particularly in roots, embryos, and fruits. Cytokinins produced in the root reach their target tissues by moving up the plant in the xylem sap. Acting in concert with auxin, cytokinins stimulate cell division and influence the pathway of differentiation. The effects of cytokinins on cells growing in tissue culture provide clues about how this class of hormones may function in an intact plant. When a piece of parenchyma tissue from a stem is cultured in the absence of cytokinins, the cells grow very large but do not divide. Cytokinins alone have no effect. If, however, cytokinins are added along with auxin, the cells divide. The ratio of cytokinin to auxin controls the differentiation of the cells. When the concentrations of the two hormones are balanced, the mass of cells continues to grow, but it remains a cluster of undifferentiated cells called a callus. If cytokinin levels are raised, shoot buds develop from the callus. If auxin levels are raised, roots form.

Control of Apical Dominance.Cytokinins, auxin, and other factors interact in the control of apical dominance, the ability of the terminal bud to suppress the development of axillary buds. Until recently, the leading hypothesis to explain the hormonal regulation of apical dominance--the direct inhibition hypothesis--proposed that auxin and cytokinin act antagonistically in regulating axillary bud growth. According to this view, auxin transported down the shoot from the terminal bud directly inhibited axillary buds from growing, causing a shoot to lengthen at the expense of lateral branching. Meanwhile, cytokinins entering the shoot system from roots counter the action of auxin by signaling axillary buds to begin growing. Thus, the ratio of auxin and cytokinin was viewed as the critical factor in controlling axillary bud inhibition. Many observations are consistent with the direct inhibition hypothesis. If the terminal bud, the primary source of auxin, is removed, the inhibition of axillary buds is removed and the plant becomes bushier (FIGURE 39.8). Application of auxin to the cut surface of the decapitated seedling resuppresses the growth of the lateral buds. Mutants that overproduce cytokinins or plants treated with cytokinins also tend to be bushier than normal. One prediction of the direct inhibition hypothesis not borne out by experiment is that decapitation, by removing the primary source of auxin, should lead to a decrease in the auxin levels of axillary buds. Biochemical studies, however, have revealed the opposite: auxin levels actually increase in the axillary buds of decapitated plants. The direct inhibition hypothesis, therefore, does not account for all experimental findings: It is likely that plant biologists have not uncovered all the pieces of this puzzle.

Fig 39-8. Apical dominance. (a) Auxin from the apical bud inhibits the growth of axillary buds. This favors elongation of the shoot's main axis. Cytokinins, which are transported upward from roots, counter auxin, stimulating the growth of axillary buds. This explains why, in many plants, axillary buds near the shoot tip are less likely to grow than those closer to the roots. (b) Removal of the apical bud from the same plant enabled lateral branches to grow.

Anti-Aging Effects.Cytokinins retard the aging of some plant organs by inhibiting protein breakdown, by stimulating RNA and protein synthesis, and by mobilizing nutrients from surrounding tissues. If leaves removed from a plant are dipped in a cytokinin solution, they stay green much longer than otherwise. Cytokinins also slow the deterioration of leaves on intact plants. Because of this anti-aging effect, florists use cytokinin sprays to keep cut flowers fresh.

Gibberellins

A century ago, farmers in Asia noticed that some rice seedlings in their paddies grew so tall and spindly that they toppled over before they could mature and flower. In 1926, the Japanese plant pathologist E. Kurosawa discovered that a fungus of the genus Gibberella caused this "foolish seedling disease" (FIGURE 39.9). By the 1930s, Japanese scientists had determined that the fungus produced hyperelongation of rice stems by secreting a chemical, which was given the name gibberellin. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that plants also make gibberellins. In the past 40 years, scientists have identified more than 100 different gibberellins that occur naturally in plants, although a much smaller number occur in each plant species. Foolish rice seedlings, it seems, suffer from an overdose of growth regulators normally found in plants in lower concentrations. Gibberellins have a variety of effects in plants.

Fig 39-9. "Foolish seedling disease" in rice. The spindly rice plants on the right are infected with the fungus Gibberella. The pathogen secretes gibberellins, a growth stimulant that uninfected plants (left) also produce, but in smaller quantity.

Stem Elongation.Roots and young leaves are major sites of gibberellin production. Gibberellins stimulate growth in both the leaves and the stem, but they have little effect on root growth. In stems, gibberellins stimulate cell elongation and cell division. Like auxin, gibberellins cause cell wall loosening, but not by acidifying the cell wall. One hypothesis proposes that gibberellins stimulate cell wall loosening enzymes that facilitate the penetration of expansin proteins into the cell wall. Thus, in a growing stem, auxin, by acidifying the cell wall and activating expansins, and gibberellins, by facilitating the penetration of expansins, act in concert to promote elongation.

The effects of gibberellins in enhancing stem elongation are evident when certain dwarf varieties (mutants) of plants are treated with gibberellins. For instance, some dwarf pea plants (including the variety Mendel studied; see Chapter 14) grow to normal height if treated with gibberellins (FIGURE 39.10). If gibberellins are applied to plants of normal size, there is often no response. Apparently, these plants are already producing optimal dose of the hormone.

Fig 39-10. Treating pea dwarfism with a growth hormone. Contrast the untreated dwarf seedlings on the left (control) with the dwarf seedlings on the right, which were treated five days earlier with an application of 5mmg of gibberellin.

The most dramatic example of gibberellin-induced stem elongation is bolting, the rapid growth of the floral stalk. In their vegetative state, some plants, such as cabbage, develop in a rosette form; that is, they are low to the ground with very short internodes. As the plant switches to reproductive growth, a surge of gibberellins induces internodes to elongate rapidly, which elevates the floral buds that develop at the tips of the stems.

Fruit Growth.In many plants, both auxin and gibberellins must be present for fruit to set. The most important commercial application of gibberellins is in the spraying of Thompson seedless grapes (FIGURE 39.11). The hormone makes the individual grapes grow larger, a trait prized by the consumer, and it makes the internodes of the grape bunch elongate, allowing more space for the individual grapes. This increase in space, by enhancing air circulation between the grapes, also makes it harder for yeast and other microorganisms to infect the fruits.

Germination.The embryo of seeds is a rich source of gibberellins. After water is imbibed, the release of gibberellins from the embryo signals the seeds to break dormancy and germinate. Some seeds that require special environmental conditions to germinate, such as exposure to light or cold temperatures, will break dormancy if they are treated with gibberellins. Gibberellins support the growth of cereal seedlings by stimulating the synthesis of digestive enzymes such as a-amylase that mobilize stored nutrients (see FIGURE 38.13).

Abscisic Acid

In the 1960s, one research group studying the chemical changes that precede bud dormancy and another team investigating chemical changes preceding leaf abscission (the dropping of autumn leaves) isolated the same compound, abscisic acid (ABA). Ironically, ABA is no longer thought to play a primary role in either bud dormancy or leaf abscission, but it is a plant hormone of great importance in other functions. Unlike the growth-stimulating hormones we have studied so far--auxin, cytokinins, and gibberellins--ABA generally slows down growth. Often ABA antagonizes the actions of the growth hormones, and it is the ratio of ABA to one or more growth hormones that determines the final physiological outcome. ABA has many effects on plants, but we will consider just two.

Seed Dormancy.Seed dormancy has great survival value because it ensures that the seed will germinate only when there are optimal conditions of light, temperature, and moisture (see Chapter 38). What prevents a seed dispersed in autumn from germinating immediately only to be killed by winter? What mechanisms ensure that such seeds germinate in the spring? For that matter, what prevents seeds from germinating in the dark, moist interior of the fruit? The answer to these questions is ABA. The levels of ABA may increase 100-fold during seed maturation. The high levels of ABA in maturing seeds inhibit germination and induce the production of special proteins that help the seeds withstand the extreme dehydration that accompanies maturation.

Many types of dormant seeds will germinate when ABA is removed or inactivated in some way. The seeds of some desert plants break dormancy only when heavy rains wash ABA out of the seed. Other seeds require light or prolonged exposure to cold to trigger the inactivation of ABA. Often the ratio of ABA to gibberellins determines whether the seed will remain dormant or germinate, and the addition of ABA to seeds that are primed to germinate returns them to the dormant condition. A maize mutant that has seeds that germinate while still on the cob lacks a functional transcription factor required for ABA to induce expression of certain genes (FIGURE 39.12).

Fig 39-12. Precocious germination of mutant maize seeds. Abscisic acid induces dormancy in seeds. When its action is blocked--in this case, by a mutation affecting an abscisic acid-regulated transcription factor--precocious germination results.

Drought Stress.ABA is the primary internal signal that enables plants to withstand drought. When a plant begins to wilt, ABA accumulates in leaves and causes stomata to close rapidly, reducing transpiration and preventing further water loss. ABA, through its effects on second messengers such as calcium, causes an increase in the opening of outwardly directed potassium channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells, leading to a massive loss of potassium from them. The accompanying osmotic loss of water leads to a reduction in guard cell turgor and a decrease in stomatal aperture (see FIGURE 36.13). In some cases, water shortage can stress the root system before the shoot system, and ABA transported from roots to leaves may function as an "early warning system.""Wilty" mutants, which are especially prone to wilting, are in many cases deficient in the production of ABA.

Ethylene

During the 19th century when coal gas was used for street illumination, the leakage of "illuminating gas" from gas mains caused nearby trees to drop their leaves prematurely. In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow demonstrated that the gas ethylene was the active factor in "illuminating gas." The idea that ethylene is a hormone that plants themselves produce only became widely accepted, however, when the advent of a technique called gas chromatography simplified the quantitative measurement of ethylene. Plants produce ethylene in response to stresses such as drought, flooding, mechanical pressure, injury, and infection. Ethylene production also occurs during fruit ripening and during programmed cell death. And ethylene is also produced in response to high concentrations of externally applied auxin. Indeed, many physiological effects previously ascribed to auxin, such as inhibition of root elongation, are now thought to be due to auxin-induced ethylene production. Ethylene has numerous effects on plants, but we shall focus on just four.

The Triple Response to Mechanical Stress: Using Mutants to Dissect a Signal-Transduction Pathway.Imagine a pea seedling pushing upward through the soil only to come up against the underside of an immovable object such as a stone. As the stem pushes against the obstacle, the mechanical stress in its delicate tip induces the seedling to start producing ethylene. Ethylene, in turn, instigates the seedling to perform a growth maneuver called the triple response that enables it to circumvent the obstacle. The three parts of this response, which you can see in FIGURE 39.13, are a slowing of stem elongation, a thickening of the stem (which makes it stronger), and a curvature that causes the stem to start growing horizontally. As the stem continues to grow, its tip touches upward intermittently. If these probings continue to detect a solid object above, then another pulse of ethylene is generated and the stem continues its horizontal progress. If, however, the upward touch detects no solid object, then ethylene production decreases, and the stem, now clear of the obstacle, resumes its normal upward growth.

Fig 39-13. Ethylene induces the triple response in pea seedlings. Either artificial treatment with the gaseous hormone ethylene or natural production of the hormone triggered by mechanical stress causes the stems of germinating pea seedlings to elongate less rapidly, to become thicker, and to grow horizontally--the triple response. This growth response is an adaptation that helps the seedling circumvent obstacles encountered during soil penetration. This experiment shows the extent of the triple response in pea seedlings treated with different concentrations of ethylene.

It is ethylene that induces the stem to grow horizontally rather than the physical obstruction per se; when ethylene is applied to normal seedlings growing free of all physical impediments, they undergo the triple response (see FIGURE 39.13).

Researchers have studied Arabidopsis mutants with abnormal triple responses to investigate the signal transduction pathways for the response. Ethylene-insensitive (ein) mutants fail to undergo the triple response after exposure to ethylene (FIGURE 39.14a). Some types of ein mutants are insensitive to the presence of ethylene because they lack a functional ethylene receptor. Other mutants undergo the triple response even out of soil, in the air, where there are no physical obstacles. Some mutants of this type have a regulatory defect that causes them to produce ethylene at rates 20 times normal. The phenotype of such ethylene-overproducing (eto) mutants can be restored to wild-type by treating the seedlings with inhibitors of ethylene synthesis. Still other mutants, called constitutive triple-response (ctr) mutants, undergo the triple response in air but do not respond to inhibitors of ethylene synthesis (FIGURE 39.14b). In this case, ethylene signal transduction is permanently turned on even though there is no ethylene present. FIGURE 39.15 summarizes the responses of ein, eto, and ctr mutants to ethylene and ethylene synthesis inhibitors.

Fig 39-15. Ethylene signal-transduction mutants can be distinguished by their different responses to experimental treatments.

The affected gene in ctr mutants turns out to code for a protein kinase. The fact that this mutation activates the ethylene response suggests that the normal kinase product of the wild-type allele is a negative regulator of ethylene signal transduction. Here is one hypothesis for how the pathway works in wild-type plants: Binding of the hormone ethylene to the ethylene receptor leads to inactivation of the kinase; and inactivation of this negative regulator allows synthesis of the proteins required for the triple response.

Apoptosis: Programmed Cell Death.Consider the shedding of a leaf in autumn or the death of an annual after flowering. Or think about the final step in the differentiation of a xylem vessel element, when its living contents are destroyed, leaving a hollow tube behind. All of these events involve the programmed death of certain cells or organs, or of the entire plant. The cells, organs and plants that are genetically programmed to die on a particular schedule do not simply shut down their cellular machinery and await death. Rather, the onset of programmed cell death, called apoptosis, is one of the busiest times in a cell's life, requiring new gene expression. During apoptosis, newly formed enzymes break down many chemical components, including chlorophyll, DNA, RNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. The plant may salvage the breakdown products. A burst of ethylene is almost always associated with this programmed destruction of cells, organs, or the whole plant.

Leaf Abscission.The loss of leaves each autumn is an adaptation that keeps deciduous trees from desiccating during winter when the roots cannot absorb water from the frozen ground. Before leaves abscise, many essential elements are salvaged from the dying leaves and are stored in stem parenchyma cells. These nutrients are recycled back to developing leaves the following spring. Fall color is a combination of new red pigments made during autumn and yellow and orange carotenoids (see Chapter 10) that were already present in the leaf but are rendered visible by the breakdown of the dark green chlorophyll in autumn.

When an autumn leaf falls, the breaking point is an abscission layer located near the base of the petiole. The small parenchyma cells of this layer have very thin walls, and there are no fiber cells around the vascular tissue. The abscission layer is further weakened when enzymes hydrolyze polysaccharides in the cell walls. Finally, the weight of the leaf, with the help of wind, causes a separation within the abscission layer. Even before the leaf falls, a layer of cork forms a protective scar on the twig's side of the abscission layer, preventing pathogens from invading the plant (FIGURE 39.16).

Fig 39-16. Abscission of a maple leaf. Abscission is controlled by a change in the balance of ethylene and auxin. The abscission layer can be seen here as a vertical band at the base of the petiole. After the leaf falls, a protective layer of cork becomes the leaf scar that helps prevent pathogens from invading the plant (LM).

A change in the balance of ethylene and auxin controls abscission. An aging leaf produces less and less auxin and this makes the cells of the abscission layer more sensitive to ethylene. As the influence of ethylene on the abscission layer prevails, the cells produce enzymes that digest the cellulose and other components of cell walls.

Fruit Ripening.Fruits help disperse the seeds of flowering plants (see Chapter 30). Immature (unripe) fruits that are tart, hard, and green become edible at the time of seed maturation. A burst of ethylene production in the fruit triggers this ripening. Enzymatic breakdown of cell wall components softens the fruit, and the conversion of starches and acids to sugars makes the fruit sweet. The production of new scents and colors helps advertise fruits' ripeness to animals, who eat the fruits and disperse the seeds.

A chain reaction occurs during ripening: ethylene triggers ripening, and ripening, in turn, triggers even more ethylene production--one of the rare examples of positive feedback in physiology (see FIGURE 1.8). The result is a huge burst in ethylene production. Because ethylene is a gas, the signal to ripen even spreads from fruit to fruit: One bad apple, in fact, does spoil the lot. If you pick or buy green fruit, you may be able to speed ripening by storing the fruit in a plastic bag, so that ethylene gas will accumulate. On a commercial scale, many kinds of fruit are ripened in huge storage containers in which ethylene levels are enhanced. In other cases, measures are taken to retard ripening caused by natural ethylene. Apples, for instance, are stored in bins flushed with carbon dioxide. Circulating the air prevents ethylene from accumulating, and carbon dioxide inhibits synthesis of new ethylene. Stored in this way, apples picked in autumn can still be shipped to grocery stores the following summer.

Given the importance of ethylene in the post-harvest physiology of fruits, the genetic engineering of ethylene signal transduction pathways has potentially important commercial applications. For example, molecular biologists, by adding an antisense RNA that blocks the transcription of one of the genes required for ethylene synthesis, have created tomato fruits that ripen on demand. These fruits are picked while green and will not ripen unless ethylene gas is added. As such methods are refined, they will reduce spoilage of fruits and vegetables, a problem that currently ruins almost half the produce harvested in the United States.

Brassinosteroids

First isolated from Brassica pollen in 1979, brassinosteroids are steroids chemically similar to cholesterol and the sex hormones of animals. Brassinosteroids induce cell elongation and division in stem segments and seedlings at concentrations as low as 10-12M. They also retard leaf abscission and promote xylem differentiation. These effects are so qualitatively similar to those of auxin that it took several years for plant physiologists to accept brassinosteroids as nonauxin hormones.

It was evidence from molecular biology that established brassinosteroids as plant hormones. Joanne Chory, our interviewee on pages 718-719, and her colleagues at the Salk Institute in San Diego were interested in Arabidopsis mutants that had morphological features similar to light-grown plants even though they were grown in the dark. The researchers discovered that the mutation affects a gene that normally codes for an enzyme similar to one involved in steroid synthesis in mammalian cells. The researchers also showed that the mutant plants could be restored to normal phenotype by the experimental application of brassinosteroids. The mutant studied by Chory was brassinosteroid-deficient.

As we conclude our survey of plant hormones, it is important to remember that these chemical signals are components of control systems that tune a plant's growth, development, reproduction, and physiology to the environment. For example, you learned that auxin functions in the phototropic bending of shoots toward light; that abscisic acid "holds" certain seeds dormant until the environment is suitable for germination; and that ethylene functions in leaf abscission as shorter days and cooler temperatures announce autumn. Such relationships between outside stimuli and hormonal signals are important to keep in mind as we examine how plants actually detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.





 Blue-light photoreceptors are a heterogeneous group of pigments

The action spectra of many plant processes, including phototropism (the bending toward or away from light), the light-induced slowing of hypocotyl elongation when a seedling breaks ground during germination (see FIGURE 38.14), and the light-induced opening of stomata (see FIGURE 36.13), show that blue light is most effective in initiating these diverse responses. (FIGURE 39.17 illustrates phototropism as an example.) The biochemical identity of the blue-light photoreceptor was so elusive that in the 1970s plant physiologists began to refer to this putative receptor as cryptochrome (from the Greek kryptos, hidden, and chrom, pigment). In the 1990s, molecular biologists analyzing Arabidopsis mutants found that plants actually use at least three completely different types of pigments to detect blue light: cryptochromes (for the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation), phototropin (for phototropism), and a carotenoid-based photoreceptor called zeaxanthin (for stomatal opening).

 Phytochromes function as photoreceptors in many plant responses to light

When we introduced signal transduction in plants earlier in the chapter, we discussed the role of a family of plant pigments called phytochromes in the greening process. Phytochromes regulate many of a plant's responses to light throughout its life from seed to flower. Let's look at a couple of examples.

The Phytochrome Switch and Seed Germination

It was studies of seed germination that led to the discovery of phytochromes. Because of their limited food reserves, the successful sprouting of many types of small seeds, such as lettuce, requires that they germinate only when conditions, especially the light environment, are near optimal. Such seeds often remain dormant for many years until a change in light conditions. For example, the death of a shading tree or the plowing of a field may create a favorable light environment for germination.

In the 1930s, scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture determined the action spectrum for light-induced germination of lettuce seeds. They exposed water-swollen seeds to a few minutes of monochromatic (single-colored) light of various wavelengths and then stored the seeds in the dark. After two days, the researchers scored the number of seeds that had germinated under each light regimen. The action spectrum revealed that red light of 660 nm wavelength increases the germination percentage of lettuce seeds the most compared to control seeds that had not been exposed to any light. In marked contrast, far-red light, that is light of wavelengths just near the edge of human visibility (730 nm), inhibits lettuce seed germination compared to the dark controls. What happens when the lettuce seeds are subjected to a flash of red (R) light followed by a flash of far-red (FR) light or, conversely, to FR light followed by R light? The answer is that the last flash of light determines the seeds' response (FIGURE 39.18). In other words, the effects of red and far-red light are reversible.

The photoreceptor responsible for these opposing effects of red and far-red light is a phytochrome. It consists of a protein covalently bonded to a nonprotein part that functions as a chromophore, the light-absorbing part of the molecule (FIGURE 39.19). So far, researchers have identified five different phytochromes in Arabidopsis, each with a slightly different protein component.

Fig 39-19. Structure of a phytochrome.

The chromophore of a phytochrome reverts back and forth between two isomeric forms (see Chapter 4 to review isomers). One isomer absorbs red light, and the other absorbs far-red light. The two variations of phytochrome--Pr (red absorbing) and Pfr (far-red absorbing)--are said to be photoreversible: 

This Pr Pfr interconversion acts as a switching mechanism that controls various light-induced events in the life of the plant (FIGURE 39.20). Pfr is the form of phytochrome that triggers many of a plant's developmental responses to light. For example, in the seed germination experiments we just described, Pr in the lettuce seeds that were exposed to red light was converted to Pfr, stimulating the cellular responses that lead to germination. When the red-illuminated seeds were then exposed to far-red light, the Pfr was converted back to Pr, inhibiting the germination response.

Fig 39-20. Phytochrome: a molecular switching mechanism. Absorption of red light causes the bluish Pr to change to the blue-greenish Pfr. Far-red light reverses this conversion. In most cases, it is the Pfr form of the pigment that switches on physiological and developmental responses in the plan

How does phytochrome switching explain light-induced germination in nature? Plants synthesize phytochrome as Pr, and if seeds are kept in the dark the pigment remains almost entirely in the Pr form (FIGURE 39.20). But if the seeds are illuminated with sunlight, the phytochrome is exposed to red light (along with all the other wavelengths in sunlight), and much of the Pr is converted to Pfr. This appearance of Pfr is one of the ways that plants detect sunlight. When seeds are exposed to adequate sunlight for the first time, it is the appearance of Pfr that triggers their germination.

The Phytochrome Switch and Shade Avoidance

The phytochrome system also provides the plant with information about the quality of light. Sunlight includes both red and far-red radiation. Thus, during the day the Pr Pfr photoreversion reaches a dynamic equilibrium, with the ratio of the two phytochrome forms indicating the relative amounts of red and far-red light. This sensing mechanism enables plants to adapt to changes in light conditions. Consider, for example, the "shade-avoidance" response of a tree that requires relatively high light intensity. If other trees in a forest shade this tree, the phytochrome ratio shifts in favor of Pr because the forest canopy screens out more red light than far-red light. (This is because the chlorophyll pigments in the leaves of the canopy absorb red light and allow far-red light to pass.) This shift in the ratio of red to far-red light induces the tree to allocate more of its resources to growing taller. In contrast, direct sunlight increases the proportion of Pfr, which stimulates branching and inhibits vertical growth.

In addition to enabling plants to detect light and distinguish its quality, phytochromes also function in a plant's ability to keep track of the passage of days and seasons. To understand phytochrome's role in these timekeeping processes, we must first examine the clock itself.





 Biological clocks control circadian rhythms in plants and other eukaryotes

Many plant processes, such as transpiration and synthesis of certain enzymes, oscillate during the course of a day. Some of these cyclic variations are responses to the changes in light levels, temperature, and relative humidity that accompany the 24-hour cycle of day and night. However, one can eliminate these exogenous (external) factors by growing plants in growth chambers under rigidly maintained conditions of light, temperature, and humidity. Even under these artificially constant conditions, many physiological processes in plants, such as the opening and closing of stomata and the production of photosynthetic enzymes, continue to oscillate with a frequency of about 24 hours. For example, many legumes lower their leaves in the evening and raise them in the morning (FIGURE 39.21). A bean plant will continue these "sleep movements" even if kept in constant light or constant darkness; the leaves are not simply responding to sunrise and sunset. Such physiological cycles with a frequency of about 24-hours and that are not directly paced by any known environmental variable are called circadian rhythms (from the Latin circa, approximately, and dies, day). Circadian rhythms are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic life. For example, your pulse, blood pressure, temperature, rate of cell division, blood cell count, alertness, urine composition, metabolic rate, sex drive, and responsiveness to medications all fluctuate in a circadian manner.

Fig 39-21. Sleep movements of a bean plant. Leaf position at noon (top) and at midnight. The movements are caused by reversible changes in the turgor pressure of cells on opposing sides of the pulvini, swollen regions of the petiole.

Are circadian rhythms truly prompted by an internal clock, or are they merely daily responses to some subtle but pervasive environmental cycle, such as geomagnetism or cosmic radiation? Organisms, including plants and humans, continue their rhythms when placed in the deepest mine shafts or when orbited in satellites, conditions that alter these subtle geophysical periodicities. All research thus far indicates that the oscillator for circadian rhythms is endogenous (internal). This internal clock, however, is entrained (set) to a period of precisely 24 hours by daily signals from the environment.

If an organism is kept in a constant environment, its circadian rhythms deviate from a 24-hour period (a "period" is the duration of one cycle). These free-running periods, as they are called, vary from about 21 to 27 hours, depending on the particular rhythmic response. The sleep movements of bean plants, for instance, have a period of 26 hours when the plants are kept under the free-running conditions of constant darkness. Deviation of the free-running period from exactly 24 hours does not mean that biological clocks drift erratically. Free-running clocks are still keeping perfect time, but they are not synchronized with the outside world.

How do biological clocks work? In attempting to answer this question, we must be careful to differentiate between the oscillator (clock) and the rhythmic processes it controls. The sweeping leaves of sleep movements are the "hands" of the biological clock, but these movements are not the essence of the clockwork itself. If the leaves of a bean plant are restrained for several hours so they cannot move, they will, on release, rush to the position appropriate for the time of day. We can interfere with a biological rhythm, but the clockwork goes right on ticking off the time.

Researchers are tracing the clock to a molecular mechanism that may be common to all eukaryotes. A leading hypothesis is that biological timekeeping may depend on synthesis of a protein that regulates its own production through feedback control. This protein may be a transcription factor that inhibits transcription of the gene that encodes for the transcription factor itself. The concentration of this transcription factor may accumulate during the first half of the circadian cycle, and then decline during the second half, due to self-inhibition of its own production.

Researchers have recently used a novel technique to identify clock mutants of Arabidopsis. One prominent circadian rhythm in plants is the daily production of certain photosynthesis-related proteins. Molecular biologists traced this rhythm to the promoter that regulates the transcription of the genes for these photosynthesis proteins. To identify clock mutants, scientists spliced the gene for an enzyme called luciferase to the promoter. Luciferase is the enzyme responsible for the bioluminescence of fireflies. When the biological clock turned on the promoter in the Arabidopsis genome, it also turned on the production of luciferase. The plants began to glow with a circadian periodicity. Clock mutants were then isolated by selecting specimens that glowed for a longer or shorter time than normal. The defective genes in some of these mutants affect proteins that normally bind photoreceptors. Perhaps these particular mutations disrupt a light-dependent mechanism that sets the biological clock.





 Light entrains the biological clock

As we have discussed, the free running period of the circadian rhythm of bean leaf movements is 26 hours. Consider a bean plant placed at dawn in a dark cabinet for 72 hours: Its leaves would not rise again until 2 hours after natural dawn on the second day, and 4 hours after natural dawn on the third day, and so on. Shut off from environmental cues, the plant then becomes desynchronized with its natural environment. Desynchronization also happens when we cross several time zones in an airplane; when we reach our destination, the clocks on the wall are not synchronized with our internal clocks. All eukaryotes are probably prone to jetlag.

What entrains the biological clock to precisely 24 hours every day? The answer is light. Both phytochrome and blue-light photoreceptors can entrain circadian rhythms in plants, but our understanding of how phytochrome does this is more complete. As you might suspect, the mechanism involves turning cellular responses on and off by means of the Pr Pfr switch.

Consider once again the photoreversible system diagrammed in FIGURE 39.20. In darkness, the phytochrome ratio shifts gradually in favor of the Pr form. This is partly due to turnover in the overall phytochrome pool. The pigment is synthesized in the Pr form, and degradative enzymes destroy more Pfr than Pr. In addition, in some plant species, Pfr present at sundown slowly converts to Pr by a biochemical mechanism. In darkness, there is no means for the accumulating Pr to be reconverted to Pfr, but when the sun rises, the Pfr level suddenly increases again by rapid photochemical conversion from Pr. It is this sudden increase in Pfr each day at dawn that resets the biological clock: bean leaves always reach their most extreme night position 16 hours after dawn.

Interactions between phytochrome and the biological clock enable plants to measure the passage of night and day in nature. The relative lengths of night and day, however, change over the course of the year (except at the Equator). Plants use this change to mark the passage of seasons.





 Photoperiodism synchronizes many plant responses to changes of season

Imagine the consequences if a plant produced flowers when its insect pollinators were not present or if a deciduous tree produced leaves in the middle of winter. Seasonal events are of critical importance in the life cycles of most plants. Seed germination, flowering, and the onset and breaking of bud dormancy are examples of stages in plant development that usually occur at specific times of the year. The environmental stimulus plants use most often to detect the time of year is the photoperiod, the relative lengths of night and day. A physiological response to photoperiod, such as flowering, is called photoperiodism.

Photoperiodism and the Control of Flowering

One of the earliest clues to how plants detect the progression of seasons came from a mutant variety of tobacco studied by W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard in 1920. This variety, named Maryland Mammoth, grew exceptionally tall but failed to flower during summer, when normal tobacco plants flowered. Maryland Mammoth finally bloomed in a greenhouse in December. After trying to induce earlier flowering by varying temperature, moisture, and mineral nutrition, Garner and Allard learned that it was the shortening days of winter that stimulated Maryland Mammoth to flower. If the plants were kept in light-tight boxes so that lamps could be used to manipulate durations of "day" and "night," flowering occurred only if the day length was 14 hours or shorter. Maryland Mammoth did not flower during summer because, at Maryland's latitude, the days were too long during that season.

Garner and Allard termed Maryland Mammoth a short-day plant, because it apparently required a light period shorter than a critical length to flower. Chrysanthemums, poinsettias, and some soybean varieties are a few of the other short-day plants, which generally flower in late summer, fall, or winter. Another group of plants dependent on photoperiod will flower only when the light period is longer than a certain number of hours. These long-day plants generally flower in late spring or early summer. Spinach, for example, flowers when days are 14 hours or longer. Radish, lettuce, iris, and many cereal varieties are also long-day plants. Flowering in a third group, day-neutral plants, is unaffected by photoperiod. Tomatoes, rice, and dandelions are examples of day-neutral plants, which flower when they reach a certain stage of maturity, regardless of day length at that time.

Critical Night Length.In the 1940s, researchers discovered that it is actually night length, not day length, that controls flowering and other responses to photoperiod. Many of these scientists worked with cocklebur, a short-day plant that flowers only when days are 16 hours or shorter (and nights are at least 8 hours long). These researchers found that if the daytime portion of the photoperiod is broken by a brief exposure to darkness, there is no effect on flowering. However, if the nighttime part of the photoperiod is interrupted by even a few minutes of dim light, cocklebur will not flower, and this turned out to be true for other short-day plants as well (FIGURE 39.22a, p. 822). Cocklebur is actually unresponsive to day length, but it requires at least 8 hours of continuous darkness to flower. Short-day plants are really long-night plants, but the older term is embedded firmly in the jargon of plant physiology. Similarly, long-day plants are actually short-night plants. A long-day plant grown on photoperiods of long nights that would not normally induce flowering will flower if the period of continuous darkness is interrupted by a few minutes of light (FIGURE 39.22b, p. 822). Notice that we distinguish long-day from short-day plants not by an absolute night length but by whether the critical night length sets a maximum (long-day plants) or minimum (short-day plants) number of hours of darkness required for flowering. In both cases, the actual number of hours in the critical night length is specific to each species of plant.

Red light is the most effective color in interrupting the nighttime portion of the photoperiod. Action spectra and photoreversibility experiments show that phytochrome is the pigment that receives the red light (FIGURE 39.23). For example, if a flash of red light (R) during the dark period is followed immediately by a flash of far-red (FR) light, then the plant detects no interruption of night length. As in the case of phytochrome-mediated seed germination, red/far-red photoreversibility can be demonstrated.

Plants measure night length very accurately; some short-day plants will not flower if night is even one minute shorter than the critical length. Some plant species always flower on the same day each year. It appears that plants use their biological clock, apparently entrained with the help of phytochrome, to tell the season of the year by measuring night length. The floriculture (flower-growing) industry has applied this knowledge to produce flowers out of season. Chrysanthemums, for instance, are short-day plants that normally bloom in fall, but their blooming can be stalled until Mother's Day in May by punctuating each long night with a flash of light, thus turning one long night into two short nights.

Some plants bloom after a single exposure to the photoperiod required for flowering. Other species need several successive days of the appropriate photoperiod. Still other plants will respond to a photoperiod only if they have been previously exposed to some other environmental stimulus, such as a period of cold temperatures. Winter wheat, for example, will not flower unless it has been exposed to several weeks of temperatures below 10&#176;C. This requirement for pretreatment with cold before flowering is called vernalization. Several weeks after winter wheat is vernalized, a photoperiod with long days (short nights) induces flowering.

Is There a Flowering Hormone?

Buds produce flowers, but it is leaves that detect photoperiod. When the photoperiodic requirement for flowering is met, leaves must send a signal to the buds cuing them to develop as flowers. To induce a short-day plant or long-day plant to flower, it is enough in many species to expose a single leaf to the appropriate photoperiod. Indeed, if only one leaf is left attached to the plant, photoperiod is detected and floral buds are induced. If all leaves are removed, however, the plant is blind to photoperiod. Most plant physiologists believe the flowering signal is a hormone or some change in the relative concentrations of two or more hormones (FIGURE 39.24). The flowering stimulus appears to be the same for short-day and long-day plants, despite the difference in the photoperiodic conditions required for their leaves to send this signal. The evidence for hormonal regulation of flowering is compelling, but researchers have not yet identified the hormone(s).

Fig 39-24. Experimental evidence for a flowering hormone(s). If a plant that has been induced to flower by photoperiod is grafted to a plant that has not been induced, both plants flower, indicating the transmission of a flower-inducing substance. This works in some cases even if one is a short-day plant and the other is a long-day plant.

Meristem Transition from Vegetative Growth to Flowering

Whatever combination of environmental cues (such as photoperiod or vernilization) and internal signals (such as hormones) is necessary for flowering to occur, the outcome is the transition of a bud's meristem from a vegetative state to a flowering state. This transition requires changes in the expression of genes that regulate pattern formation. Meristem-identity genes that specify that the bud will now form a flower instead of a vegetative shoot must first be switched on. Then the organ-identity genes that specify the spatial organization of the floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--are activated in the appropriate regions of the meristem (see FIGURES 21.19 and 35.12). Research on flower development is progressing rapidly, and one goal is to identify the signal-transduction pathways that link such cues as photoperiod and hormonal changes to the gene expression required for flowering.





 Plants respond to environmental stimuli through a combination of developmental and physiological mechanisms

Responses to Gravity

Since plants are solar-powered organisms, it is not surprising that mechanisms for growing toward sunlight have evolved. But what environmental cue does the shoot of a young seedling use to grow upward when it is completely underground and there is no light for it to detect? Similarly, what environmental factor prompts the young root to grow downward? The answer to both questions is gravity.

Place a seedling on its side, and it will adjust its growth so that the shoot bends upward and the root curves downward. In their responses to gravity, or gravitropism, roots display positive gravitropism and shoots exhibit negative gravitropism. Gravitropism functions as soon as a seed germinates, ensuring that the root grows into the soil and the shoot reaches sunlight regardless of how the seed happens to be oriented when it lands. Auxin plays a major role in gravitropic responses.

Plants may tell up from down by the settling of statoliths, specialized plastids containing dense starch grains, to the lower portions of cells (FIGURE 39.25). In roots, statoliths are located in certain cells of the root cap. According to one hypothesis, the aggregation of statoliths at the low points of these cells triggers the redistribution of calcium, which in turn causes lateral transport of auxin within the root. The calcium and auxin accumulate on the lower side of the root's zone of elongation. (Because these chemicals are dissolved, they do not respond to gravity but must be actively transported to one side of the root.) At high concentration, auxin inhibits cell elongation, an effect that slows growth on the lower side of the root. The more rapid elongation of cells on the upper side causes the root to curve as it grows. This tropism continues until the root is growing straight down.

Fig 39-25. The statolith hypothesis for root gravitropism. These corn roots were placed on their sides and photographed before (top) and 1.5 hours after initiation of the gravitropic response. The light micrographs show the locations of statoliths, modified plastids, within cells of the root cap. The settling of statoliths to the low points of these cells may be a gravity-sensing mechanism that leads to the redistribution of auxin and the differential rates of elongation by cells on opposite sides of the root

Plant physiologists are refining the "falling statolith" hypothesis of root gravitropism as they try new experiments. For example, mutants of Arabidopsis and tobacco that lack statoliths are still capable of gravitropism, though the response is slower than in wild-type plants. It could be that the entire cell helps the root sense gravity by mechanically pulling on proteins that tether the protoplast to the cell wall, stretching the proteins on the "up" side and compressing the proteins on the "down" side of the root cells. Dense organelles (in addition to starch granules) may also contribute by distorting the cytoskeleton as they are pulled by gravity. Statoliths, because of their density, may enhance gravitational sensing by a mechanism that works more slowly in their absence.

Responses to Mechanical Stimuli

A tree growing on a windy mountain ridge will usually have a shorter, stockier trunk than a tree of the same species growing in a more sheltered location. The advantage of this stunting of growth is that it enables the plant to hold its ground against strong gusts of wind. The term thigmomorphogenesis (from the Greek thigma, touch) refers to the changes in form that result from mechanical perturbation. Plants are very sensitive to mechanical stress: Some researchers have found that even the act of measuring the length of a leaf with a ruler alters its subsequent growth.

Rubbing the stems of a young plant a few times results in plants that are shorter than controls (FIGURE 39.26). Mechanical stimulation activates a signal-transduction pathway involving an increase in cytoplasmic calcium that, in turn, mediates the activation of specific genes, some of which encode for proteins that affect cell wall properties.

Fig 39-26. Altering gene expression by touch in Arabidopsis. The shorter plant on the left was touched twice a day. The unmolested plant (right) grew much taller.

Some plant species have become, over the course of their evolution, "touch specialists." Acute responsiveness to mechanical stimuli is an integral part of these plants' life "strategies." Most vines and other climbing plants have tendrils that coil rapidly around supports (see FIGURE 35.6a). These grasping organs usually grow straight until they touch something; the contact stimulates a coiling response caused by differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the tendril. This directional growth in response to touch is called thigmotropism, and it allows the vines to take advantage of whatever mechanical supports it comes across as it climbs upward toward a forest canopy.

Other examples of touch specialists are plants that undergo rapid leaf movements in response to mechanical stimulation. For example, when the compound leaf of the sensitive plant Mimosa is touched, it collapses and its leaflets fold together (FIGURE 39.27). This response, which takes only a second or two, results from a rapid loss of turgor by cells within pulvini, specialized motor organs located at the joints of the leaf. The motor cells suddenly become flaccid after stimulation because they lose potassium, which causes water to leave the cells by osmosis. It takes about ten minutes for the cells to regain their turgor and restore the "unstimulated" form of the leaf. The function of the sensitive plant's behavior invites speculation. Perhaps by folding its leaves and reducing its surface area when jostled by strong winds, the plant conserves water. Or perhaps because the collapse of the leaves exposes thorns on the stem, the rapid response of the sensitive plant discourages herbivores.

Fig 39-27. Rapid turgor movements by the sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica). (a) In the unstimulated plant, leaflets are spread apart. (b) Within a second or two of being touched, the leaflets have folded together. (c) In these light micrographs of a leaflet pair in the closed (stimulated) state, you can see the motor cells in the sectioned pulvini (motor organs). The curvature of a pulvinus is caused by motor cells on one side losing water and becoming flaccid while cells on the opposite side retain their turgor.

A remarkable feature of rapid leaf movements is the mode of transmission of the stimulus through the plant. If one leaflet on a sensitive plant is touched, first that leaflet responds, then the adjacent leaflet responds, and so on until all the leaflet-pairs have folded together. From the point of stimulation, the signal that produces this response travels at a speed of about a centimeter per second. Traveling at the the same rate, an electrical impulse can be detected by attaching electrodes to the leaf. These impulses, called action potentials, resemble nervous-system messages in animals, though the action potentials of plants are thousands of times slower. Action potentials, which have been discovered in many species of algae and plants, may be widely used as a form of internal communication. Another example is the Venus flytrap, in which action potentials are transmitted from sensory hairs in the trap to the cells that respond by closing the trap (see FIGURE 37.16a). In the case of Mimosa, more violent stimuli, such as touching a leaf with a hot needle, causes all the leaves and leaflets on a plant to droop, but this systemic response involves the spread of chemical signals released from the injured area to other parts of the shoot.

Responses to Stress

Occasionally, factors in the environment change severely enough to have a potentially adverse effect on a plant's survival, growth, and reproduction. Environmental stresses, such as flooding, drought, or extreme temperatures can have a devastating impact on crop yields in agriculture. In natural ecosystems, plants that cannot tolerate an environmental stress will either succumb or be outcompeted by other plants, and they will become locally extinct. Thus, environmental stresses are also important in determining the geographic ranges of plants. Here, we consider some of the more common abiotic (nonliving) stresses that plants encounter. In the next section, we will examine the defensive responses of plants to common biotic (biological) stresses such as pathogens and herbivores.

Drought.On a bright, warm, dry day, a plant may be stressed by a water deficiency because it is losing water by transpiration faster than the water can be restored by uptake from the soil. Prolonged drought can stress crops and the plants of natural ecosystems for weeks or months. Severe water deficit, of course, will kill a plant, as you may know from experience with neglected houseplants. But plants have control systems that enable them to cope with less extreme water deficits.

Many of a plant's responses to water deficit help the plant conserve water by reducing the rate of transpiration. Water deficit in a leaf causes guard cells to lose turgor, a simple control mechanism that slows transpiration by closing stomata (see Chapter 36). Water deficit also stimulates increased synthesis and release of abscisic acid in the leaf, and this hormone helps keep stomata closed by acting on guard cell membranes. Leaves respond to water deficit in several other ways. Because cell expansion is a turgor-dependent process, a water deficit will inhibit the growth (expansion) of young leaves. This response minimizes the transpirational loss of water by slowing the increase in leaf surface. When the leaves of many grasses and other plants wilt from a water deficit, they roll into a shape that reduces transpiration by exposing less leaf surface to dry air and wind. While all of these responses of leaves help the plant conserve water, they also reduce photosynthesis. This is one reason a drought diminishes crop yield.

Root growth also responds to water deficit. During a drought, the soil usually dries from the surface down. This inhibits the growth of shallow roots, partly because cells cannot maintain the turgor required for elongation. Deeper roots surrounded by soil that is still moist continue to grow. Thus, the root system proliferates in a way that maximizes exposure to soil water.

Flooding.An overwatered houseplant may suffocate because the soil lacks the air spaces that provide oxygen for cellular respiration in the roots. Some plants are structurally adapted to very wet habitats. For example, the submerged roots of trees called mangroves, which inhabit coastal marshes, are continuous with aerial roots that provide access to oxygen. But how do plants less specialized for aquatic environments cope with oxygen deprivation in waterlogged soils? Oxygen deprivation stimulates the production of the hormone ethylene, which causes some of the cells in the root cortex to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death). Enzymatic destruction of cells creates air tubes that function as "snorkels," providing oxygen to the submerged roots (FIGURE 39.28).

(b) An experimental root grown in a nonaerated hydroponic medium. Ethylene-stimulated apoptosis (programmed cell death) creates the air tubes.

Salt Stress.An excess of sodium chloride or other salts in the soil threatens plants for two reasons. First, by lowering the water potential of the soil solution, salt can cause a water deficit in plants even though the soil has plenty of water. This is because in an environment with a water potential more negative than that of the root tissue, roots will lose water rather than absorb it (see Chapter 36). The second problem with saline soil is that sodium and certain other ions are toxic to plants when their concentrations are relatively high. The selectively permeable membranes of root cells impede the uptake of most harmful ions, but this only aggravates the problem of acquiring water from soil that is rich in solutes. Many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing compatible solutes, organic compounds that keep the water potential of cells more negative than that of the soil solution without admitting toxic quantities of salt. However, most plants cannot survive salt stress for long. The exceptions are halophytes, salt-tolerant plants with adaptations such as salt glands. These glands pump salts out across the leaf epidermis.

Heat Stress.Excessive heat can harm and eventually kill a plant by denaturing its enzymes and damaging its metabolism in other ways. One function of transpiration is evaporative cooling. On a warm day, for example, the temperature of a leaf may be 3-10&#176;C below ambient air temperature. Of course, hot, dry weather also tends to cause water deficiency in many plants; the closing of stomata in response to this stress conserves water but sacrifices evaporative cooling. This dilemma is one of the reasons that very hot, dry days take such a toll on most plants.

Most plants have a backup response that enables them to survive heat stress. Above a certain temperature--about 40&#176;C for most plants that inhabit temperate regions--plant cells begin synthesizing relatively large quantities of special proteins called heat-shock proteins. Researchers have also discovered this response in heat-stressed animals and microorganisms. Some heat-shock proteins are identical to chaperone proteins, which function in unstressed cells as temporary scaffolds that help other proteins fold into their functional shapes (see Chapter 5). In their roles as heat-shock proteins, perhaps these molecules embrace enzymes and other proteins and help prevent denaturation.

Cold Stress.One problem plants face when the temperature of the environment falls is a change in the fluidity of cell membranes. Recall from Chapter 8 that a biological membrane is a fluid mosaic, with proteins and lipids moving laterally in the plane of the membrane. When a membrane cools below a critical point, it loses its fluidity as the lipids become locked into crystalline structures. This alters solute transport across the membrane and also adversely affects the functions of membrane proteins. Plants respond to cold stress by altering the lipid composition of their membranes. For example, membrane lipids increase in their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which have shapes that help keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures by impeding crystal formation (see FIGURE 8.4b). Such molecular modification of the membrane requires from several hours to days, which is one reason rapid chilling is generally more stressful to plants than the more gradual drop in air temperature that occurs seasonally.

Freezing is a more severe version of cold stress. At subfreezing temperatures, ice forms in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of most plants. (The cytosol generally does not freeze at the cooling rates encountered in nature because it contains more solutes than the very dilute solution found in the cell wall--solutes depress the freezing point of a solution.) The reduction in liquid water in the cell wall caused by ice formation lowers the extracellular water potential, causing water to leave the cytoplasm. The resulting increase in the concentration of ionic salts in the cytoplasm is harmful and can lead to cell death. Whether the cell survives depends to a large extent on how resistant it is to dehydration. Plants native to regions where winters are cold have special adaptations that enable them to cope with freezing stress. For example, before the onset of winter, the cells of many frost-tolerant species increase their cytoplasmic levels of specific solutes, such as sugars, that are better tolerated at high concentrations, and which help reduce the loss of water from the cell during extracellular freezing.





 Plants deter herbivores with both physical and chemical defenses

Herbivory--animals eating plants--is a stress that plants face in any ecosystem. Plants counter excessive herbivory with both physical defenses, such as thorns, and chemical defenses, such as the production of distasteful or toxic compounds. For example, some plants produce an unusual amino acid called canavanine, named for one of its sources, the jackbean (Canavalia ensiformis). Canavanine resembles arginine, one of the 20 amino acids organisms incorporate into their proteins. If an insect eats a plant containing canavanine, the molecule is incorporated into the insect's proteins in place of arginine. Because canavanine is different enough from arginine to adversely affect the conformation and hence the function of the proteins, the insect dies.

At least some plants even recruit predatory animals that help defend the plant against specific herbivores. For example, insects called parasitoid wasps inject their eggs into their prey, including caterpillars feeding on plants. The eggs hatch within the caterpillars, and the larvae eat through their organic containers from the inside out. The plant, which benefits from the destruction of the herbivorous caterpillars, has an active role in this ecological drama. A leaf damaged by caterpillars releases volatile compounds that attract parasitoid wasps. The stimulus for this response is a combination of the physical damage to the leaf caused by the munching caterpillar and a specific compound present in the caterpillar's saliva (FIGURE 39.29).

The volatile molecules a plant releases in response to herbivore damage can also function as an "early warning system" for nearby plants of the same species. Lima bean plants infested with spider mites release volatile chemicals that signal "news" of the attack to neighboring, noninfested lima bean plants. In response to these volatiles, noninfested lima bean leaves activate defense genes. Volatiles released from artificially wounded leaves do not have the same effect. The expression pattern of the genes activated by the infestation-released volatiles is similar to that produced by exposure to jasmonic acid, an important molecule in plant defense. As a result of this gene activation, noninfested neighbors become less susceptible to spider mites and more attractive to another species of mite that preys upon spider mites.





 Plants use multiple lines of defense against pathogens

A plant's first line of defense against infection is the physical barrier of the plant's "skin," the epidermis of the primary plant body and the periderm of the secondary plant body (see Chapter 35). This first defense system, however, is not impenetrable. Viruses, bacteria, and the spores and hyphae of fungi can enter the plant through injuries or through natural openings in the epidermis, such as stomata. Once a pathogen invades, the plant mounts a chemical attack as a second line of defense that kills the pathogens and prevents their spread from the site of infection. This second defense system is enhanced by the plant's inherited ability to recognize certain pathogens.

Gene-for-Gene Recognition

Plants are generally resistant to most pathogens. This is because plants have an innate ability to recognize invading pathogens and to mount successful defenses. In a converse manner, successful pathogens cause disease because they are able to evade recognition or suppress host defense mechanisms. Pathogens against which a plant has little specific defense are said to be virulent. They are the exceptions, for if they were not, then hosts and pathogens would soon perish together. A kind of "compromise" has coevolved between plants and most of their pathogens. In such cases, the pathogen gains enough access to its host to perpetuate itself without severely damaging or killing the plant. Such strains of pathogens are termed avirulent.

Specific resistance to a plant disease is based on what is called gene-for-gene recognition, because it depends on a precise match-up between a genetic allele in the plant and an allele in the pathogen. This occurs when a plant with specific dominant resistance alleles (R) recognizes those pathogens that possess complementary avirulence (Avr) alleles (FIGURE 39.30). Specific recognition induces expression of certain plant genes, the products of which mount a defense against the pathogen. If the plant host does not contain the appropriate R gene, the pathogen can invade and kill the plant. There are many pathogens, and plants have many R genes--Arabidopsis has at least several hundred.

Fig 39-30. Gene-for-gene resistance of plants to pathogens. (a) Resistance occurs when the plant has a particular dominant R allele that corresponds to a specific dominant Avr allele in the pathogen. R genes probably code for specific receptors. Avr genes produce compounds that function in the pathogen but also act as ligands that bind specifically to the host-plant cell's receptors. Disease occurs if there is no gene-for-gene recognition because (b) the pathogen has no dominant Avr allele matching an R allele in the plant, (c) the plant has no dominant R allele matching an Avr allele in the pathogen, or (d) both pathogen and plant lack alleles upon which recognition could be based.

It is not the R and Avr genes themselves that interact, of course, but their products. The product of an R gene is probably a specific receptor protein inside a plant cell or at its surface. The Avr gene probably leads to production of some "signal" molecule from the pathogen, a ligand capable of binding specifically to the plant cell's receptor. The Avr product undoubtedly has some function upon which the pathogen itself depends, but the plant is able to "key" on this molecule as an announcement of the pathogen's presence. Binding of the ligand to the receptor triggers a signal-transduction pathway leading to a defense response in the infected plant tissue. This defense includes both an enhancement of the localized response at the site of infection and a more general systemic response of the whole plant.

Hypersensitive Response

Even if a plant is infected by a virulent strain of a pathogen--one for which that particular plant has no genetic resistance--the plant is able to mount a localized chemical attack in response to molecular signals released from cells damaged by the infection. Molecules called elicitors, often cellulose fragments called oligosaccharins released by cell-wall damage, induce the production of antimicrobial compounds called phytoalexins. Infection also activates genes that produce PR proteins (for pathogenesis-related). Some of these proteins are antimicrobial, attacking molecules in the cell wall of a bacterium, for example. Others may function as signals that spread "news" of the infection to nearby cells. Infection also stimulates cross-linking of molecules in the cell wall and deposition of lignin, responses that set up a local barricade that slows spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant.

If the pathogen is avirulent based on an R-Avr match, the localized defense response is more vigorous and is called a hypersensitive response (abbreviated HR). There is an enhanced production of phytoalexins and PR proteins, and the "sealing" response that contains the infection is more effective. After cells at the site of infection mount their chemical defense and seal off the area, they destroy themselves. We can see the result of an HR as lesions on a leaf or other infected organ. As "sick" as such a leaf appears, it will survive, and its defense response will help protect the rest of the plant (FIGURE 39.31).

Fig 39-31. Defense responses against an avirulent pathogen.

Systemic Acquired Resistance

The hypersensitive response, as you have learned, is localized and specific, a containment response based on gene-for-gene (R-Avr) recognition between host and pathogen. However, this defense response also includes production of chemical signals that "sound the alarm" of infection to the whole plant. Released from the site of infection, the alarm hormones are transported throughout the plant, stimulating production of phytoalexins and PR proteins. This response, called systemic acquired resistance (SAR), is nonspecific, providing protection against a diversity of pathogens for days (FIGURE 39.31).

A good candidate for one of the hormones responsible for activating SAR is salicylic acid. A modified form of this compound, acetylsalicylic acid, is the active ingredient in aspirin. Centuries before aspirin was sold as a pain reliever, some cultures had learned that chewing the bark of a willow tree (Salix) would lessen the pain of a toothache or headache. With the discovery of systemic acquired resistance, biologists have finally learned one function of salicylic acid in plants. Aspirin turns out to be a natural medicine in the plants that produce it, but with effects entirely different from the medicinal action in humans who consume the drug.

Plant biologists investigating disease resistance and other evolutionary adaptations of plants are getting to the heart of how a plant responds to internal and external signals. These scientists, along with thousands of other plant biologists working on other questions and millions of students experimenting with plants in biology courses, are all extending a centuries-old tradition of curiosity about the green organisms that feed the biosphere.

It is natural for us to be curious about how our bodies work. In these chapters on animal form and function, you will indeed learn much about human anatomy and physiology. But the scope of this unit of chapters is not limited to humans or even to vertebrates. The study of animal form and function is integrated by the common set of problems that all animals must solve. How, for example, do animals as different as hydras, halibut, and humans obtain oxygen from their environments? How do they nourish themselves? excrete waste products? move? Our main goal in this unit of chapters is to see how animals of diverse evolutionary history and varying complexity solve these general challenges of life. This chapter introduces the unit with some unifying concepts that apply across the animal kingdom.

 Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment



An animal's size and shape, features that biologists often call body plans or designs, are fundamental aspects of form and function that significantly affect the way an animal interacts with its environment. By using the terms plan and design here, we do not mean to imply that animal body forms are products of a conscious invention. The body plan or design of an animal results from a pattern of development programmed by the genome, itself the product of millions of years of evolution due to natural selection.

 Animal form and function reflect biology's major themes

Animals provide vivid examples of biology's overarching theme of evolution. The adaptations we will observe in our comparative study of animals evolved by natural selection. The long, tonguelike proboscis of the hawk moth in the photo you see on this page is a structural adaptation for feeding. Recoiled when not in use, the proboscis extends as a straw through which the moth can suck nectar from deep within tube-shaped flowers.

A foraging hawk moth illustrates another major theme, one we introduced in Chapter 1: regulation. While natural selection provides a mechanism for long-term adaptation, organisms also have the capacity to adjust to environmental change over the short term by physiological responses (these short-term responses are themselves evolutionary adaptations). Many insects are inactive when it is cold. But Manduca sexta, the hawk moth species in our opening photo, can forage for nectar when air temperatures are as low as 5&#176;C. The moth uses a shivering-like mechanism for preflight warm-up of its muscles. Once the moth takes off, metabolic activity of its flight muscles generates heat, and a variety of regulatory adaptations maintain a temperature of about 30&#176;C in the muscles, even though the external temperature may be close to freezing. (You'll learn more about this regulation in Chapter 44.)

Searching for food, generating body heat and regulating internal temperature, sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, and all other animal activities require fuel in the form of chemical energy. Thus, we will apply concepts of bioenergetics--how organisms obtain, process, and use their energy resources--as another theme throughout our comparative study of animals.

And there's one more theme to guide our study of animals: the correlation of structure and function. Which is the better utensil: a spoon or a fork? The answer, of course, depends on what you are trying to eat. Given a choice of tools, you would not eat broth with a fork or a salad with a spoon. Form fits function. The same principle applies to life at its many levels, from molecules to organisms. Analyzing a biological structure such as a hawk moth's proboscis gives us clues about what it does and how it works. Conversely, knowing the function of a structure provides insight about its construction, such as the strawlike anatomy of Manduca's proboscis. Anatomy is the study of the structure of an organism; physiology is the study of the functions an organism performs. The distinction blurs when we apply the structure-function theme, and "anatomy-and-physiology" then rolls off the tongue as though it were one big compound noun. We could use the term functional anatomy instead. But here, our analogy to human inventions such as eating utensils breaks down. Without any sort of goal, natural selection can fit structure to function by selecting, over many generations, for what works best among the available options presented by a varying population. Thus, the form-function principle is just another extension of biology's central theme of evolution.





 Function correlates with structure in the tissues of animals

Life is characterized by hierarchical levels of organization, each with emergent properties (see Chapter 1). Animals are multicellular organisms with their specialized cells grouped into tissues. In most animals, combinations of various tissues make up functional units called organs, and groups of organs that work together form organ systems. For example, the human digestive system consists of a stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and several other organs, each a composite of different kinds of tissues.

Tissues are groups of cells with a common structure and function. Different types of tissues have different structures that are especially suited to their functions. A tissue may be held together by a sticky extracellular matrix that coats the cells (see FIGURE 7.29) or weaves them together in a fabric of fibers. Indeed, the term tissue is from a Latin word meaning "weave."

Tissues are classified into four main categories: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, nervous tissue, and muscle tissue. These are present to some extent in all but the simplest animals; the following survey emphasizes the tissues of vertebrates.

Epithelial Tissue

Occurring in sheets of tightly packed cells, epithelial tissue covers the outside of the body and lines organs and cavities within the body (FIGURE 40.1, p. 836). The cells of an epithelium are closely joined, with little material between them. In many epithelia, the cells are riveted together by tight junctions (see FIGURE 7.30). This tight packing enables the epithelium to function as a barrier protecting against mechanical injury, invasive microorganisms, and fluid loss. The free surface of the epithelium is exposed to air or fluid, whereas the cells at the base of the barrier are attached to a basement membrane, a dense mat of extracellular matrix.

Fig 40-1. The structure and function of epithelial tissues. The structure of an epithelium fits its function.

Two criteria for classifying epithelia (plural) are the number of cell layers and the shape of the cells on the free surface. A simple epithelium has a single layer of cells, whereas a stratified epithelium has multiple tiers of cells. A pseudostratified epithelium is single-layered, but it appears to be stratified because the cells vary in length. The shape of the cells that are at the free surface of an epithelium may be cuboidal (like dice), columnar (like bricks on end), or squamous (flat like floor tiles). Combining the features of cell shape and number of layers, we get such terms as simple cuboidal epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium (see FIGURE 40.1).

As well as protecting the organs they line, some epithelia, called glandular epithelia, absorb or secrete chemical solutions. For example, glandular epithelia lining tubules in the thyroid gland secrete a hormone that regulates the body's rate of fuel consumption. The glandular epthelia that line the lumen (cavity) of the digestive and respiratory tracts form a mucous membrane; they secrete a slimy solution called mucus that lubricates the surface and keeps it moist. The free epithelial surfaces of some mucous membranes have beating cilia that move the film of mucus along the surface. For example, the ciliated epithelium of our respiratory tubes helps keep our lungs clean by trapping dust and other particles and sweeping them back up the trachea (windpipe).

Connective Tissue

Connective tissue functions mainly to bind and support other tissues. In contrast to epithelia, with their tightly packed cells, connective tissues have a sparse population of cells scattered through an extracellular matrix. The matrix generally consists of a web of fibers embedded in a uniform foundation that may be liquid, jellylike, or solid. In most cases, the substances of the matrix are secreted by the cells of the connective tissue.

Connective tissue fibers, which are made of protein, are of three kinds: collagenous fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagenous fibers are made of collagen, probably the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom. Collagenous fibers are nonelastic and do not tear easily when pulled lengthwise. If you pinch and pull some skin on the back of your hand, it is mainly collagen that keeps the flesh from tearing away from the bone. Elastic fibers are long threads made of a protein called elastin. Elastic fibers provide a rubbery quality that complements the nonelastic strength of collagenous fibers. When you pinch the back of your hand and then let go, elastic fibers quickly restore your skin to its original shape. Reticular fibers are very thin and branched. Composed of collagen and continuous with collagenous fibers, they form a tightly woven fabric that joins connective tissue to adjacent tissues.

The major types of connective tissue in vertebrates are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood (FIGURE 40.2). Each has a structure correlated with its specialized functions.

The most widespread connective tissue in the vertebrate body is loose connective tissue. It binds epithelia to underlying tissues and functions as packing material, holding organs in place. This type of connective tissue gets its name from the loose weave of its fibers. Loose connective tissue has all three fiber types: collagenous, elastic, and reticular.

Among the cells scattered in the fibrous mesh of loose connective tissue, two types predominate: fibroblasts and macrophages. Fibroblasts secrete the protein ingredients of the extracellular fibers. Macrophages are amoeboid cells that roam the maze of fibers, engulfing bacteria and the debris of dead cells by phagocytosis (see Chapter 8). They are weapons in an elaborate arsenal of defense you will learn more about in Chapter 43.

Adipose tissue is a specialized form of loose connective tissue that stores fat in adipose cells distributed throughout its matrix. Adipose tissue pads and insulates the body and stores fuel as fat molecules (see FIGURE 4.5). Each adipose cell contains a large fat droplet that swells when fat is stored and shrinks when the body uses fat as fuel.

Fibrous connective tissue is dense, due to its large numbers of collagenous fibers. The fibers are organized into parallel bundles, an arrangement that maximizes nonelastic strength. We find this type of connective tissue in tendons, which attach muscles to bones, and in ligaments, which join bones together at joints.

Cartilage has an abundance of collagenous fibers embedded in a rubbery matrix made of a substance called chondroitin sulfate, a protein-carbohydrate complex. Chondroitin sulfate and collagen are secreted by cells called chondrocytes (see FIGURE 40.2). The composite of collagenous fibers and chondroitin sulfate makes cartilage a strong yet somewhat flexible support material. The skeleton of a shark is made of cartilage. Other vertebrates, including humans, have cartilaginous skeletons during the embryo stage, but most of the cartilage is replaced by bone as the embryo matures. We nevertheless retain cartilage as flexible support in certain locations, such as the nose, the ears, the rings that reinforce the windpipe, the discs that act as cushions between our vertebrae, and the caps on the ends of some bones.

The skeleton supporting the body of most vertebrates is made of bone, a mineralized connective tissue. Bone-forming cells called osteoblasts deposit a matrix of collagen. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ions combine and harden within the matrix into the mineral hydroxyapatite. The combination of hard mineral and flexible collagen makes bone harder than cartilage without being brittle. The microscopic structure of hard mammalian bone consists of repeating units called osteons (or Haversian systems) (see FIGURE 40.2). Each osteon has concentric layers of the mineralized matrix, which are deposited around a central canal containing blood vessels and nerves that service the bone. Once osteoblasts become trapped in their own secretions, they are called osteocytes. (We will examine bones and skeletons in more detail in Chapter 49.)

Although blood functions differently from other connective tissues, it does meet the criterion of having an extensive extracellular matrix. In this case, the matrix is a liquid called plasma, consisting of water, salts, and a variety of dissolved proteins. Suspended in the plasma are two classes of blood cells, erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells), and cell fragments called platelets. Red cells carry oxygen; white cells function in defense against viruses, bacteria, and other invaders; and platelets aid in blood clotting. Blood will be discussed in detail in Chapters 42 and 43.

Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue senses stimuli and transmits signals from one part of the animal to another. The functional unit of nervous tissue is the neuron, or nerve cell, which is uniquely specialized to transmit signals called nerve impulses (FIGURE 40.3). It consists of a cell body and two or more extensions, or processes, called dendrites and axons, which may be as long as a meter in humans. Dendrites transmit impulses from their tips toward the rest of the neuron. Axons transmit impulses toward another neuron or toward an effector, a structure such as a muscle cell that carries out a body response. We will postpone a detailed discussion of the structure and function of neurons until Chapter 48.

Fig 40-3. The basic structure of a neuron. This nerve cell from the spinal cord has a large cell body with multiple processes that transmit electrical signals called impulses (LM).

Muscle Tissue

Muscle tissue is composed of long cells called muscle fibers that are capable of contracting when stimulated by nerve impulses. Arranged in parallel within the cytoplasm of muscle fibers are large numbers of myofibrils made of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. Muscle is the most abundant tissue in most animals, and muscle contraction accounts for much of the energy-consuming cellular work in an active animal.

In the vertebrate body, there are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (FIGURE 40.4). Attached to bones by tendons, skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movements of the body. Adults have a fixed number of muscle cells; weight lifting and other methods of building muscle do not increase the number of cells but simply enlarge those already present. Skeletal muscle is also called striated muscle because the arrangement of overlapping filaments gives the cells a striped (striated) appearance under the microscope.

Fig 40-4. Three kinds of vertebrate muscle.

Cardiac muscle forms the contractile wall of the heart. It is striated like skeletal muscle, but cardiac cells are branched. The ends of the cells are joined by structures called intercalated discs, which relay signals from cell to cell during a heartbeat.

Smooth muscle, so named because it lacks striations, is found in the walls of the digestive tract, urinary bladder, arteries, and other internal organs. The cells are spindle-shaped. They contract more slowly than skeletal muscles but can remain contracted longer. Controlled by different kinds of nerves than those controlling skeletal muscles, smooth muscles are responsible for involuntary body activities, such as churning of the stomach or constriction of arteries. You will learn more about the control and contraction of muscles in Chapter 49.





 The organ systems of an animal are interdependent

In all but the simplest animals (sponges and some cnidarians), different tissues are organized into organs. In some organs the tissues are arranged in layers. For example, the vertebrate stomach has four major tissue layers (FIGURE 40.5). A thick epithelium lines the lumen and secretes mucus and digestive juices into it. Outside this layer is a zone of connective tissue, surrounded by a thick layer of smooth muscle. Yet another layer of connective tissue encapsulates the entire stomach.

Fig 40-5. Tissue layers of the stomach, a digestive organ. The wall of the stomach and other tubular organs of the digestive system has four main tissue layers.

Many of the organs of vertebrates are suspended by sheets of connective tissue called mesenteries in body cavities moistened or filled with fluid. Mammals have a thoracic cavity housing the lungs and heart that is separated from the lower abdominal cavity by a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm.

A level of organization higher than organs, organ systems carry out the major body functions of most animals (TABLE 40.1, p. 840). Each organ system consists of several organs and has specific functions, but the efforts of all systems must be coordinated for the animal to survive. For instance, nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract are distributed throughout the body by the circulatory system. But the heart that pumps blood through the circulatory system depends on nutrients absorbed by the digestive tract and also on oxygen (O2) obtained from the air or water by the respiratory system. Any organism, whether single-celled or an assembly of organ systems, is a coordinated living whole greater than the sum of its parts.

 Physical laws constrain animal form

Imagine the horror of wading into a murky lake and feeling your legs engulfed by a squishy amoeba the size of a pro wrestler. Fortunately, you don't have to add this to your worry list. It will never happen. Physical requirements constrain what natural selection can "invent," including the size of single cells. An amoeba the size of a human could never move materials across its membrane fast enough to satisfy such a large blob of cytoplasm. This is just one example of how physical law--in this case, the math of surface-to-volume relations--affects the evolution of an organism's form.

Consider another example: how the laws of hydrodynamics constrain the shapes that are possible for aquatic animals that swim very fast. Tuna and other fast bony fishes can swim at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour. Sharks, penguins (birds), and aquatic mammals such as dolphins, seals, and whales are also fast swimmers. And they all have the same basic body shape. It's called a fusiform shape, which means tapered on both ends (FIGURE 40.6). Water is about a thousand times denser than air, and thus the slightest bump that causes drag impedes a swimmer even more than it does a runner or a flyer. We should expect speedy fishes and marine mammals to have similar shapes, because the laws of hydrodynamics are universal. This is an example of convergent evolution (see Chapter 25). Convergence occurs because natural selection shapes similar adaptations when diverse organisms face the same environmental challenge, such as the resistance of water to fast travel.

Fig 40-6. Evolutionary convergence on fusiform shapes in fast swimmers.





 Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment

An animal's size and shape have a direct effect on how the animal exchanges energy and materials with its surroundings. As a requirement for maintaining the fluid integrity of the plasma membranes of its cells, an animal body must be arranged so that all of its living cells are bathed in an aqueous medium. Exchange with the environment occurs as dissolved substances diffuse and are transported across the plasma membranes between the cells and their aqueous surroundings. As shown in FIGURE 40.7a, a single-celled protist living in water has a sufficient surface area of plasma membrane to service its entire volume of cytoplasm because it is so small. A large cell has less surface area relative to its volume than a smaller cell of the same shape (see FIGURE 7.5). As you learned in the preceding concept, this is one of the physical constraints on the size of protists such as amoebas.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 40-7. Contact with the environment. (a) In a unicellular organism, such as this amoeba, the entire surface area contacts the environment. Because of its small size, the cell has a large surface area relative to its volume through which to exchange materials with the external world. (b) A hydra is bilayered. Because the aqueous environment can circulate in and out of its mouth, virtually every one of its cells directly contacts the environment and exchanges materials with it.

Multicellular animals are composed of microscopic cells, each with its own plasma membrane that functions as a loading and unloading platform for a modest volume of cytoplasm. But this only works if all the cells of the animal have access to a suitable aqueous environment. A hydra, built on the sac plan, has a body wall only two cell layers thick (FIGURE 40.7b). Because its gastrovascular cavity opens to the exterior, both outer and inner layers of cells are bathed in water. A flat body shape is another way to maximize exposure to the surrounding medium. For instance, a tapeworm may be several meters long, but because it is very thin, most of its cells are bathed in the intestinal fluid of the worm's vertebrate host, from which it obtains nutrients.

Two-layered sacs and flat shapes are designs that put a large surface area in contact with the environment, but these simple forms do not allow much complexity in internal organization. Most animals are more complex and made up of compact masses of cells; their outer surfaces are relatively small compared with their volume. As an extreme comparison, the surface-to-volume ratio of a whale is millions of times smaller than that of a protozoan, yet every cell in the whale must be bathed in fluid and have access to oxygen, nutrients, and other resources. Whales and most other animals have extensively folded or branched internal surfaces specialized for exchange with the environment (FIGURE 40.8, p. 842). The circulatory system shuttles materials among all the exchange surfaces within the animal.

Fig 40-8. Internal exchange surfaces of complex animals. This diagrammatic animal illustrates logistics of chemical exchange with the environment by a mammal. Most animals have expansive surfaces that are specialized for exchanging certain chemicals with the surroundings. These exchange surfaces are usually internal, but are connected to the environment via openings on the body surface (the mouth, for example). The exchange surfaces are finely branched or folded, giving them a very large area. The digestive, respiratory, and excretory systems all have such specialized surfaces. Chemicals that are transported across these surfaces are carried throughout the body by the circulatory system.

Although exchange with the environment is a problem for animals whose cells are mostly internal, complex body forms have distinct benefits. Because the animal's external surface need not be bathed in water, it is possible for the animal to live on land. Also, because the immediate environment for the cells is the internal body fluid, the animal's organ systems can control the composition of the solution bathing its cells.





 Mechanisms of homeostasis moderate changes in the internal environment

More than a century ago, French physiologist Claude Bernard made the distinction between the external environment surrounding an animal and the internal environment in which the cells of the animal actually live. The internal environment of vertebrates is called the interstitial fluid (see FIGURE 40.8). This fluid, which fills the spaces between our cells, exchanges nutrients and wastes with blood contained in microscopic vessels called capillaries. Bernard also recognized that many animals tend to maintain relatively constant conditions in their internal environment, even when the external environment changes. A pond-dwelling hydra is powerless to affect the temperature of the fluid that bathes its cells, but the human body can maintain its "internal pond" at a more-or-less constant temperature of about 37&#176;C. Our bodies also can control the pH of our blood and interstitial fluid to within a tenth of a pH unit of 7.4, and regulate the amount of sugar in our blood so that it does not fluctuate for long from a concentration of 0.1%. There are times, of course, during the development of an animal when major changes in the internal environment are programmed to occur. For example, the balance of hormones in human blood is altered radically during puberty and pregnancy. Still, the stability of the internal environment is remarkable.

Today, Bernard's "constant internal milieu" is incorporated into the concept of homeostasis, which means "steady state," or internal balance. One of the main objectives of modern physiology, and a theme of this unit, is to learn how animals maintain homeostasis. Actually, the internal environment of an animal always fluctuates slightly. Homeostasis is a dynamic state, an interplay between outside forces that tend to change the internal environment and internal control mechanisms that oppose such changes.





 Homeostasis depends on feedback circuits

Any homeostatic control system has three functional components: a receptor, a control center, and an effector. The receptor detects a change in some variable of the animal's internal environment, such as change in body temperature. The control center processes information it receives from the receptor and directs an appropriate response by the effector. As a nonliving example of how these components interact, consider how the temperature of a room is controlled (FIGURE 40.9a). In this case, the control center, called a thermostat, also contains the receptor (a thermometer). When room temperature falls below a set point, say 20&#176;C, the thermostat switches on the heater (the effector). When the thermometer detects a temperature above the set point, the thermostat switches the heater off. This type of control circuit is called negative feedback, because a change in the variable being monitored triggers the control mechanism to counteract further change in the same direction. Owing to a lag time between reception and response, the variable drifts slightly above and below the set point, but the fluctuations are moderate. Negative-feedback mechanisms prevent small changes from becoming too large. Most homeostatic mechanisms in animals operate on this principle of negative feedback.

Fig 40-9. An example of negative feedback: control of temperature. Regulating either (a) room or (b) body temperature depends on a control center that detects temperature change and activates mechanisms that reverse that change.

Our own body temperature is kept close to a set point of 37&#176;C by the cooperation of several negative-feedback circuits that regulate energy exchange with the environment (FIGURE 40.9b). One of these involves sweating as a means to dispose of metabolic heat and cool the body. A thermostat in the brain monitors the temperature of the blood. If the thermostat detects a rise in body temperature above the set point, it sends nerve impulses directing sweat glands to increase their production of sweat, thereby lowering body temperature by evaporative cooling (see FIGURE 3.4). When body temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat in the brain stops sending the signals to the glands, and the body retains more of the heat produced by metabolism. We will see several examples of negative feedback in the chapters that follow.

In contrast to negative feedback, positive feedback involves a change in some variable that triggers mechanisms that amplify rather than reverse the change. During childbirth, for instance, the pressure of the baby's head against sensors near the opening of the uterus stimulates uterine contractions, which cause greater pressure against the uterine opening, heightening the contractions, which causes still greater pressure. Positive feedback brings childbirth to completion, a very different sort of process from maintaining a steady state.

It is important not to overstate the concept of a constant internal environment. In fact, regulated change is essential to normal body functions. In some cases the changes are cyclical, such as the changes in hormone levels responsible for the menstrual cycle in women (see Chapter 46). In other cases a regulated change is a reaction to a challenge to the body. For example, the human body reacts to certain infections by raising the set point for temperature to a slightly higher level, and the resulting fever helps fight the infection. Over the short term, homeostatic mechanisms keep body temperature close to a set point, whatever it is at that particular time. But over the longer term, homeostasis allows regulated change in the body's internal environment.

Internal regulation is expensive. Anyone who pays utility bills is aware of the energy costs for heating or cooling a home to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. Similarly, animals use a considerable portion of the energy from the food they eat to maintain favorable internal conditions. Animals must manage their energy resources not only for homeostasis, but for everything else they do, including movement, defense against disease, and reproduction. Let's take a closer look at some basic concepts of animal energetics.





 Animals are heterotrophs that harvest chemical energy from the food they eat

All organisms require chemical energy for growth, physiological processes, maintenance and repair, regulation, and reproduction. Plants use light energy to build energy-rich organic molecules from water and CO2, and then use those organic molecules for fuel. In contrast, animals are heterotrophs and must obtain their chemical energy in food, which contains organic molecules synthesized by other organisms. Food is digested by enzymatic hydrolysis (see FIGURE 5.2), and energy-containing fuel molecules are absorbed by body cells. Once absorbed, fuel molecules have several possible fates. Most are used to generate ATP by the catabolic processes of cellular respiration and fermentation (see Chapter 9). The chemical energy of ATP powers cellular work, enabling cells, organs, and organ systems to perform the many functions that keep an animal alive. Since the production and use of ATP generates heat, an animal must continuously lose heat to its surroundings (heat balance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 44).

After the energetic needs of staying alive are met, any remaining food molecules can be used in biosynthesis, including body growth and repair, synthesis of storage material such as fat, and production of reproductive structures, including gametes (FIGURE 40.10). Biosynthesis requires both carbon skeletons for new structures and ATP to power their assembly. In some situations, biosynthetic products (such as body fat) can be broken down into fuel molecules for production of additional ATP, depending on the needs of the animal (see FIGURE 9.19).

 Metabolic rate provides clues to an animal's bioenergetic "strategy"

The flow of energy through an animal--the animal's bioenergetics--ultimately sets the limits to the animal's behavior, growth, and reproduction and determines how much food it needs. An understanding of bioenergetics tells us a great deal about an animal's adaptations and how it fits into its environment as an energy consumer. How much of the total energy an animal obtains from food does it need just to stay alive? How much energy must be expended to walk, run, swim, or fly from one place to another? What fraction of energy intake can be used for reproduction? Physiologists obtain answers to such questions by measuring the rates at which animals use chemical energy and how these rates change in different circumstances.

The amount of energy an animal uses in a unit of time is called its metabolic rate--the sum of all the energy-requiring biochemical reactions occurring over a given time interval. Energy is measured in calories (cal) or kilocalories (kcal). (A kilocalorie is 1,000 calories. The term Calorie, with a capital C, as used by many nutritionists, is actually a kilocalorie.)

Metabolic rate can be determined in several ways. Because nearly all of the chemical energy used in cellular respiration eventually appears as heat, metabolic rate can be measured by monitoring an animal's rate of heat loss. An animal is placed in a calorimeter, which is a closed, insulated chamber equipped with a device that records the animal's heat loss. Calorimeters are used most often with small animals, since they are cumbersome with large animals. A more indirect way to measure metabolic rate is to determine the amount of oxygen consumed or carbon dioxide produced by an animal's cellular respiration (FIGURE 40.11). Over long periods, the rate of food consumption and the energy content of the food (about 4.5-5 kcal per gram of protein or carbohydrate and about 9 kcal per gram of fat) can be used to estimate metabolic rate, but this method must account for the energy in food that cannot be used by the animal (the energy lost in feces and urine).

Fig 40-11. Measuring metabolic rate.

There are two basic bioenergetic "strategies" used by animals. Birds and mammals are mainly endothermic, meaning their bodies are warmed by heat generated by metabolism, and their body temperature must be maintained at a certain level to sustain life (see Chapter 34). Endothermy is a high-energy strategy that permits intense, long-duration activity over a wide range of environmental temperatures. In contrast, most fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates are ectothermic, meaning they do not produce enough metabolic heat to have much effect on body temperature. The ectothermic strategy requires much less energy than is needed by endotherms, because of the energy cost of heating (or cooling) an endothermic body. However, ectotherms are generally incapable of intense activity over long periods.





 Metabolic rate per gram is inversely related to body size among similar animals

One of animal biology's most intriguing but largely unanswered questions has to do with the relationship between body size and metabolic rate. By measuring the metabolic rates of many species of vertebrates and invertebrates, physiologists have shown that the amount of energy it takes to maintain each gram of body weight is inversely related to body size. Each gram of a mouse, for instance, consumes about 20 times more calories than a gram of an elephant (even though the whole elephant, of course, uses far more calories than the whole mouse). The higher metabolic rate of a smaller animal's tissues demands a proportionately greater rate of delivery of oxygen. And correlated with its higher metabolic rate, the smaller animal also has a higher breathing rate, blood volume (relative to its size), and heart rate (pulse) and must eat much more food per unit of body mass.

What explains the inverse relationship between metabolic rate and size? One hypothesis is that for endotherms, the smaller the animal, the greater the energy cost of maintaining a stable body temperature. This idea stems from the surface area to volume relationship: The smaller an animal, the greater its surface area to volume ratio, and thus the greater the loss of heat to (or gain of heat from) the surroundings. Logical as this hypothesis appears to be, it fails to explain the inverse relationship between metabolism and size in ectotherms (which do not use metabolic heat to maintain body temperature) and is not supported by various experimental tests. Researchers continue to search for causes underlying the inverse relationship between body size and metabolic rate.





 Animals adjust their metabolic rates as conditions change

Every animal has a range of metabolic rates. Minimal rates power the basic functions that support life, such as cell maintenance, breathing, and heartbeat. The metabolic rate of a nongrowing endotherm at rest, with an empty stomach, and experiencing no stress, is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR). The BMR for humans averages about 1,600 to 1,800 kcal per day for adult males and about 1,300 to 1,500 kcal per day for adult females. These BMRs are about equivalent to the energy consumption of a 75-watt light bulb.

In ectotherms, body temperature changes with the temperature of the surroundings, and so does metabolic rate. Unlike BMRs, which can be determined within a range of environmental temperatures, the minimal metabolic rate of an ectotherm must be determined at a specific temperature. The metabolic rate of a resting, fasting, nonstressed ectotherm is called its standard metabolic rate (SMR).

For both ectotherms and endotherms, activity has a large effect on metabolic rate. Any behavior, even a person working quietly at a desk or an insect extending its wings, consumes energy beyond the BMR or SMR. Maximal metabolic rates (the highest rates of ATP utilization) occur during peak activity, such as lifting heavy weights, all-out running, or high-speed swimming.

In general, an animal's maximum possible metabolic rate is inversely related to the duration of activity. FIGURE 40.12 contrasts the ectothermic and endothermic "strategies" for sustaining activity over different time intervals. Both an alligator (ectotherm) and a human (endotherm) are capable of very intense exercise in short spurts of a minute or less. During these "sprints," the ATP present in muscle cells and ATP generated anaerobically by glycolysis can power the activity. Neither the ectotherm nor the endotherm can sustain their maximum metabolic rates and peak levels of activity over longer periods of exercise, though the endotherm has an advantage in such endurance tests. Sustained activity depends on the aerobic process of cellular respiration for ATP supply, and an endotherm's respiration rate is about 10 times greater than an ectotherm's. Only endotherms are capable of long-duration activities such as distance running.

Fig 40-12. Maximum metabolic rates over different time spans. The two bars at the far right compare the resting metabolic rates for an ectotherm (alligator) versus an endotherm (human) of equivalent size. Note the much higher energy cost required for the endothermic "strategy." The other bars compare the two animals for their maximum potential metabolic rates and ATP sources over different durations of time.

Between the extremes of BMR or SMR and maximal metabolic rate, many factors influence energy requirements, including age, sex, size, body and environmental temperatures, the quality and quantity of food, activity level, oxygen availability, hormonal balance, and time of day. Birds, humans, and many insects are usually active (and therefore have their highest metabolic rates) during daylight hours. In contrast, bats, mice, and many other mammals generally are active and have their highest metabolic rates at night or during the hours of dawn and dusk. Metabolic rates measured when animals are performing a variety of activities give a better idea of the energy costs of everyday life. For most terrestrial animals (both ectotherms and endotherms), the average daily rate of energy consumption is 2-4 times BMR or SMR. Humans in most developed countries have an unusually low average daily metabolic rate of about 1.5 times BMR--an indication of relatively sedentary lifestyles.





 Energy budgets reveal how animals use energy and materials

Different species of animals use the energy and materials in food in different ways, depending on their environment, behavior, size, and basic energy "strategy" of endothermy or ectothermy. For most animals, the majority of food is devoted to the production of ATP, and relatively little goes to growth or reproduction. However, the amount of energy used for BMR (or SMR), activity, and temperature control varies considerably between species. For example, consider the typical annual energy "budgets" of four terrestrial vertebrates: a 25 gram female deer mouse, a 4-kg female python, a 4-kg male Ad&eacute;lie penguin, and a 60-kg female human (FIGURE 40.13). We will assume that all of these animals reproduce during the year in question.

Fig 40-13. Annual energy budgets for four animals.

The female human spends a large fraction of her energy budget for BMR and relatively little for activity and temperature regulation. The small amount of growth, about 1% of her annual energy budget, is equivalent to adding about 1 kg of body fat or 5-6 kg of other tissues. The cost of nine months of pregnancy and several months of breast-feeding amounts to only 5-8% of the mother's annual energy requirements.

A male penguin spends a much larger fraction of his energy expenditures for activity because he must swim to catch his food. Since the penguin is well insulated and fairly large, he has relatively low costs of temperature regulation in spite of living in the cold Antarctic environment. His reproductive costs, about 6% of annual energy expenditures, mainly come from incubating eggs and bringing food to his chicks. Penguins, like most birds, do not grow once they are adults.

The deer mouse spends a large fraction of her energy budget for temperature regulation. Because of the high surface-to-volume ratio that goes with small size, mice lose body heat rapidly to the environment and must constantly generate metabolic heat to maintain body temperature. Female deer mice spend about 12% of their energy budgets on reproduction.

In contrast to these endothermic animals, the ectothermic python has no temperature regulation costs. Like most reptiles, she grows continuously throughout life. In the FIGURE 40.13 example, the snake added about 750 g of new body tissue. She also produced about 650 g of eggs. The python's economical ectothermic strategy is revealed by her very low annual energy expenditure, which is only 1/40 of the energy expended by the same-sized endothermic penguin (see FIGURE 40.13b).

Throughout our study of animal biology, we will encounter many other examples of how bioenergetics relates to the form and function of diverse animals.

Having examined some general principles of animal biology, we are now ready to compare how diverse animals perform such activities as digestion, circulation, gas exchange, excretion of wastes, reproduction, and coordination--the topics of the next several chapters.

Every mealtime is a reminder that we are heterotrophs dependent on a regular supply of food derived from other or ganisms. As a group, animals exhibit a great variety of nutritional adaptations. The snowshoe hare shown in the photograph on this page is adapted for life in northern forests. Able to obtain all their nutritional needs from plants alone, hares and rabbits have a large intestinal pouch housing prokaryotes and protists that digest cellulose. When deep snow covers the ground, a hare can live on pine, fir, or spruce branches--often the only plant materials available.

For any animal, a nutritionally adequate diet is essential for homeostasis, a steady-state balance in body function. A balanced diet provides fuel for cellular work, as well as all the materials the body needs to construct its own organic molecules. In this chapter we will examine the nutritional requirements of animals and look at some of the diverse adaptations for obtaining and processing food.

The general principles of food processing are similar for a diversity of animals, so we can use the digestive system of mammals as a representative example. The mammalian digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and various accessory glands that secrete digestive juices into the canal through ducts. Peristalsis, rhythmic waves of contraction by smooth muscles in the wall of the canal, pushes the food along the tract. At some of the junctions between specialized segments of the digestive tube, the muscular layer is modified into ringlike valves called sphincters, which close off the tube like drawstrings, regulating the passage of material between chambers of the canal. The accessory glands of the mammalian digestive system are three pairs of salivary glands, the pancreas, the liver, and the gallbladder, which stores a digestive juice.

Using the human digestive system as a model, we now follow a meal through the alimentary canal, seeing in more detail what happens to the food in each of the processing stations along the way (FIGURE 41.13).

Fig 41-13. The human digestive system. After chewing and swallowing, it takes only 5 to 10 seconds for food to pass down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it spends 2 to 6 hours being partially digested. Final digestion and nutrient absorption occur in the small intestine over a period of 5 to 6 hours. In 12 to 24 hours, any undigested material passes through the large intestine, and feces are expelled through the anus.

 Animals are heterotrophs that require food for fuel, carbon skeletons, and essential nutrients:an overview

A nutritionally adequate diet satisfies three needs: fuel (chemical energy) for all the cellular work of the body; the organic raw materials animals use in biosynthesis (carbon skeletons to make many of their own molecules); and essential nutrients, substances that the animal cannot make for itself from any raw material and therefore must obtain in food in prefabricated form.





 Homeostatic mechanisms manage an animal's fuel

The theme of bioenergetics is integral to our study of nutrition. As we saw in Chapter 40, the flow of food energy into and out of an animal can be viewed as a "budget," with the production of ATP accounting for the largest fraction by far of the energy budgets of most animals. The ATP powers basal or resting metabolism as well as activity and, in endotherms, temperature regulation. Nearly all of this ATP is derived from oxidation of organ ic fuel molecules--carbohydrates, proteins, and fats--in cellular respiration. The monomers of any of these substances can be used as fuel, though priority is usually given to carbohydrates and fats. Fats are especially rich in energy; the oxidation of fat liberates about twice the energy liberated from an equal amount of carbohydrate or protein.

Glucose Regulation as an Example of Homeostasis in Nutrition

When an animal takes in more calories than it needs to produce ATP, the excess can be used for biosynthesis. If the animal isn't growing in size or reproducing, the body tends to store the surplus in energy depots. In humans, the liver and muscle cells store energy in the form of glycogen, a polymer made up of many glucose units (see FIGURE 5.6b). Glucose is a major fuel molecule for cells, and its metabolism, regulated by hormone action, is an important aspect of homeostasis (FIGURE 41.1). If glycogen stores are full and caloric intake still exceeds caloric expenditure, the excess is usually stored as fat.

Fig 41-1. Homeostatic regulation of cellular fuel. The human body regulates the use and storage of glucose, a major cellular fuel. After a meal is digested, glucose and other monomers are absorbed into the blood from the digestive tract.

When fewer calories are taken in than are expended--perhaps because of sustained heavy exercise or lack of food--fuel is taken out of storage depots and oxidized. This may cause an animal to lose weight. The human body generally expends liver glycogen first, and then draws on muscle glycogen and fat. Most healthy people--even if they are not obese--have enough stored fat to sustain them through several weeks of starvation (an average human's energy needs can be fueled by the oxidation of only 0.3 kg of fat per day).

Caloric Imbalance

Severe problems occur if the energy budget remains out of balance for long periods. If the diet of a person or other animal is chronically deficient in calories, undernourishment results. In this condition, the stores of glycogen and fat are used up, the body begins breaking down its own proteins for fuel, muscles begin to decrease in size, and the brain can become protein-deficient. If energy intake remains less than energy expenditures, death will eventually result. Even if a seriously undernourished person survives, some of the damage may be irreversible. Because a diet of a single staple such as rice or corn can often provide sufficient calories, undernourishment is generally common only where drought, war, or some other crisis has severely disrupted the food supply. Another cause of undernourishment is anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder associated with a compulsive aversion to body fat.

Detrimental effects also result from excessive food intake. In the United States and other affluent nations, overnourishment, or obesity, is a common problem. The human body hoards fat. It tends to store any excess fat molecules obtained from food instead of using them for fuel. In contrast, when we eat an excess of carbohydrates, the body tends to increase its rate of carbohydrate oxidation. Thus, the amount of fat in the diet can have a more direct effect on weight gain than the amount of dietary carbohydrates. Fat hoarding can be a liability today, but it probably provided a fitness advantage for our hunting/gathering ancestors. Individuals with genes promoting the storage of high-energy molecules during feasts may have been those that survived famines.

Obesity

Despite its propensity to store fat, the human body seems to impose limits on weight gain (and loss). Some people remain lean and hold a more-or-less constant weight no matter how much they eat. Even obese people usually attain a relatively stable weight, generally unaffected by how much they eat. Most dieters return to their former weight soon after they stop dieting. These observations, along with several recent discoveries, suggest that complex feedback mechanisms regulate fat storage and use. In mammals, a hormone called leptin, produced by adipose cells, is a key player. An increase in adipose tissue increases leptin levels in the blood. A high leptin level cues the brain to depress appetite and to increase energy-consuming muscular activity and body-heat production. Conversely, loss of body fat decreases leptin levels in the blood, signaling the brain to increase appetite and weight gain. Apparently these feedback mechanisms regulate body weight around a fairly rigid set point in some individuals and over a relatively wide range in others. Researchers have also identified some of the genes involved in fat homeostasis and several chemical signals that underlie the brain's regulatory roles (FIGURE 41.2). Some of the signals and signal antagonists are under development as potential medications for obesity.

Fig 41-2. A ravenous rodent. This obese mouse on the left has a defect in a gene that normally produces an appetite-regulating protein. (The mouse on the right lacks the genetic defect.) Several other genes function in weight management in mammals, including humans.

Obesity may actually be beneficial in certain species. Small seabirds called petrels must fly long distances to find food. Most of the food petrel parents bring to their chicks is very rich in lipids. This minimizes the weight of the food the birds must carry during their long foraging trips (recall that fat has twice as many calories per gram as other fuels). However, in addition to energy, growing baby petrels need lots of protein for building new tissues. There is relatively little protein in their oily diet, so in order to get all the protein they need, young petrels have to consume many more calories than they burn in metabolism--and consequently they become very obese. In some petrel species, chicks at the end of the growth period weigh much more than their parents and are far too heavy to fly. These fat youngsters need to starve for several days to lose enough weight to be capable of flight. However, the fat depots in young petrels do serve an important function; the energy reserves help growing chicks survive periods when parents are unable to find enough food.





 An animal's diet must supply essential nutrients and carbon skeletons for biosynthesis

In addition to providing fuel for ATP production, an animal's diet must also supply all the raw materials needed for biosynthesis. To build the complex molecules it needs to grow and maintain itself, an animal must obtain organic precursors (carbon skeletons) from its food. Given a source of organic carbon (such as sugar) and a source of organic nitrogen (usually in amino acids from the digestion of protein), animals can fabricate a great variety of organic molecules--carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.

Besides fuel and carbon skeletons, an animal's diet must also supply essential nutrients. These are materials that must be obtained in preassembled form because the animal's cells cannot make them from any raw material (FIGURE 41.3). Some of these materials are essential for all animals, but others are needed only by certain species. For instance, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient for humans and other primates, guinea pigs, and some birds and snakes, but not for most other animals.

Fig 41-3. Obtaining essential nutrients. A giraffe, an herbivore of East Africa, chews on old bones from a dead mammal. Bones contain calcium phosphate, and osteophagia ("bone-eating") is common among herbivores living where soils and plants are deficient in phosphorus. Animals require phosphorus as a mineral nutrient to make ATP, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and bones.

An animal whose diet is missing one or more essential nutrients is said to be malnourished (recall that undernourished refers to caloric deficiency). For example, cattle and other herbivorous animals may suffer mineral deficiencies if they graze on plants growing in soil lacking key minerals (see FIGURE 41.3). Malnutrition is much more common than undernutrition in human populations, and it is even possible for an overnourished individual to be malnourished.

There are four classes of essential nutrients: essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.

Essential Amino Acids

Animals require 20 amino acids to make proteins, and most animal species can synthesize about half of these, as long as their diet includes organic nitrogen. The remaining ones, the essential amino acids, must be obtained from food in prefabricated form. Eight amino acids are essential in the adult human diet (a ninth, histidine, is essential for infants); the same amino acids are essential for most animals.

A diet that provides insufficent amounts of one or more essential amino acids causes a form of malnutrition known as protein deficiency. This is the most common type of malnutrition among humans. The victims are usually children, who, if they survive infancy, are likely to be retarded in physical and perhaps mental development.

The most reliable sources of essential amino acids are meat, eggs, cheese, and other animal products. The proteins in animal products are "complete," which means that they provide all the essential amino acids in their proper proportions. Most plant proteins are "incomplete," being deficient in one or more essential amino acids. Corn, for example, is deficient in the amino acid lysine. People forced by economic necessity or other circumstances to obtain nearly all their calories from corn would show symptoms of protein deficiency, as would those who eat only rice, wheat, or potatoes. This problem can be avoided by eating a combination of plant foods that complement one another to supply all essential amino acids. For example, beans supply the lysine that is missing in corn; and while beans are deficient in methionine, this essential amino acid is present in corn. Thus, a diet of beans and corn provides all the essential amino acids--as long as these vegetables are both consumed during the same day (FIGURE 41.4). Because the body cannot easily store amino acids, a deficiency of a single essential amino acid, even for a relatively short period, retards protein synthesis and limits the use of other amino acids. Most cultures have, by trial and error, developed balanced diets that prevent protein deficiency.

Some animals have special adaptations that get them through periods when their bodies demand extraordinary amounts of protein. For example, penguins can use their muscle protein as a source of amino acids to make new proteins when they replace their feathers after molting (FIGURE 41.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 41-5. Storing protein for growth. Penguins, such as this Ad&eacute;lie from Antarctica, must make an abundance of new protein when they molt (grow new feathers). Penguins replace all their feathers at once during a two- to three-week period. Because of the temporary loss of their insulating coat of feathers, penguins cannot swim--or feed--when molting. What is the source of amino acids for production of feather protein? There is no special storage tissue for free amino acids, but it is possible to store amino acids in certain proteins. Before molting, a penguin greatly increases its muscle mass. The penguin then breaks down the extra muscle protein, which supplies the amino acids for growing new feathers.

Essential Fatty Acids

Animals can synthesize most of the fatty acids they need. The essential fatty acids, the ones they cannot make, are certain unsaturated fatty acids (fatty acids having double bonds; see FIGURE 5.11). In humans, for example, linoleic acid must be present in the diet. This essential fatty acid is required to make some of the phospholipids found in membranes. Most diets furnish ample quantities of essential fatty acids, and thus deficiencies are rare.

Vitamins

Vitamins are organic molecules required in the diet in amounts that are quite small compared with the relatively large quantities of essential amino acids and fatty acids animals need. Tiny amounts of vitamins may suffice--from about 0.01 to 100 mg per day--depending on the vitamin. However, vitamin deficiencies can cause severe problems.

So far, 13 vitamins essential to humans have been identified. They have extremely diverse physiological functions. Vitamins are grouped into two categories: water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins (TABLE 41.1). The water-soluble vitamins include the B complex, which consists of several compounds that generally function as coenzymes in key metabolic processes. Vitamin C, also water-soluble, is required for the production of connective tissue. Excesses of water-soluble vitamins are excreted in urine, and moderate overdoses of these vitamins are probably harmless.

They have a wide variety of functions. Vitamin A is incorporated into visual pigments of the eye. Vitamin D aids in calcium absorption and bone formation. The function of vitamin E is not yet fully understood, but along with vitamin C it seems to protect the phospholipids in membranes from oxidation (you have probably encountered advertisements for dietary supplements containing vitamin E as an "antioxidant.") Vitamin K is required for blood clotting. Excesses of fat-soluble vitamins are not excreted but are deposited in body fat, so overconsumption may result in an accumulation of these compounds to toxic levels.

The subject of vitamin dosage has aroused heated scientific and popular debate. Some believe it is sufficient to meet recommended daily allowances (RDAs), the nutrient intakes proposed by nutritionists to maintain health. Others argue that RDAs are set too low for some vitamins, and a fraction of those people believe, probably mistakenly, that massive doses of vitamins confer health benefits. Research is far from complete, and debate continues, especially over optimal doses of vitamins C and E. At this time, all that can be said with any certainty is that people who eat a balanced diet are not likely to develop symptoms of vitamin deficiency.

Minerals

Minerals are simple inorganic nutrients, usually required in small amounts--from less than 1 mg to about 2,500 mg per day (TABLE 41.2). As with vitamins, mineral requirements vary with animal species. Humans and other vertebrates require relatively large quantities of calcium and phosphorus for the construction and maintenance of bone. Calcium is also necessary for the normal functioning of nerves and muscles, and phosphorus is also an ingredient of ATP and nucleic acids. Iron is a component of the cytochromes that function in cellular respiration (see FIGURE 9.13) and of hemoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein of red blood cells. Magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and molybdenum are cofactors built into the structure of certain enzymes; magnesium, for example, is present in enzymes that split ATP. Vertebrates need iodine to make thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolic rate. Sodium, potassium, and chlorine are important in nerve function and also have a major influence on the osmotic balance between cells and the interstitial fluid.

The average U.S. citizen eats enough salt to provide about 20 times the required amount of sodium. Ingesting an excess of salt or several other minerals can upset homeostatic balance and cause toxic side effects. For example, too much sodium is associated with high blood pressure, and excess iron can cause liver damage.

We now shift our attention to the kinds of foods that animals eat and how they process these foods to meet their nutritional needs.





 Most animals are opportunistic feeders

All animals eat other organisms--dead or alive, whole or by the piece. (We'll stretch "by the piece" to include parasites such as tapeworms that absorb organic molecules from host organisms across their body surface.) In general, animals fit into one of three dietary categories. Herbivores, such as gorillas, cows, hares, and many snails, eat mainly autotrophs (plants, algae). Carnivores, such as sharks, hawks, spiders, and snakes, eat other animals. Omnivores regularly consume animals as well as plant or algal matter. Omnivorous animals include cockroaches, crows, bears, raccoons, and humans, who evolved as hunters, scavengers, and gatherers.

The terms herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore represent the kinds of food an animal usually eats and the adaptations enabling it to obtain and process that food. However, most animals are opportunistic, eating foods that are outside their main dietary category when these foods are available. For example, cattle and deer, which are herbivores, may occasionally eat small animals or bird eggs, along with grass and other plants. Most carnivores obtain some nutrients from plant materials that remain in the digestive tract of the prey they eat. And all animals consume bacteria with other types of food.





 Diverse feeding adaptations have evolved among animals

The mechanisms by which animals ingest food are highly varied but fall into four main groups. Many aquatic animals are suspension-feeders that sift small food particles from the water. Clams and oysters, for example, use their gills to trap tiny morsels, which are then swept along with a film of mucus to the mouth by beating cilia. Baleen whales, the largest animals ever to live, are also suspension-feeders. They swim with their mouths agape, straining millions of small animals from huge volumes of water forced through screenlike plates attached to their jaws (FIGURE 41.6).

Fig 41-6. Suspension-feeding: a baleen whale. The humpback whale and other baleen whales use comblike plates suspended from the upper jaw to sift small invertebrates from enormous volumes of water. The whale opens its mouth and fills an expandable oral pouch with water, then closes its mouth and contracts the pouch. This forces water out of the mouth through the baleen, leaving a mouthful of trapped food.

Substrate-feeders live in or on their food source, eating their way through the food. Examples are maggots that burrow into animal carcasses, and leaf miners, which are larvae of various insects that tunnel through the interior of leaves (FIGURE 41.7). Earthworms are also substrate-feeders or, more specifically, deposit-feeders. Eating their way through the dirt, earthworms salvage partially decayed organic material consumed along with soil.

Fig 41-7. Substrate-feeding: a leaf miner. Eating its way through the soft mesophyll of an oak leaf, this caterpillar, the larva of a moth, leaves a trail of dark feces in its wake.

Fluid-feeders make their living by sucking nutrient-rich fluids from a living host (FIGURE 41.8). Mosquitoes and leeches suck blood from animals. Aphids tap the phloem sap of plants (see FIGURE 36.18). Because these fluid-feeding species harm their hosts, they are considered parasites. Hummingbirds and bees, however, are fluid-feeders that benefit their host plants, transferring pollen as they move from flower to flower to obtain nectar.

Fig 41-8. Fluid-feeding: a mosquito. This parasite has pierced the skin of its human host with hollow needlelike mouthparts and is filling its digestive tract with a blood meal (colorized SEM).

Most animals are bulk-feeders that eat relatively large pieces of food (FIGURE 41.9). Their adaptations include such diverse utensils as tentacles, pincers, claws, poisonous fangs, and jaws and teeth that kill their prey or tear off pieces of meat or vegetation.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 41-9. Bulk-feeding: a python. Most animals ingest relatively large pieces of food. This is especially true of snakes, which cannot chew their food into pieces and must swallow it whole--even if the prey is much bigger than the diameter of the snake. In this amazing scene, a rock python is beginning to ingest a gazelle it has captured and killed. After swallowing its prey, which may take more than an hour, the snake will spend two weeks or more in a quiet place digesting its meal.





 The four main stages of food processing are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination

Ingestion, the act of eating, is only the first stage of food processing. Nearly all animals, even many fluid-feeders, must deal with food that is "packaged" in bulk form and contains very complex arrays of molecules, including large polymers and various substances that may be difficult to process or may even be toxic. Organic material in food consists largely of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the form of starch and other polysaccharides. Animals cannot use these macromolecules directly, for two reasons. First, polymers are too large to pass through membranes and enter the cells of the animal. Second, the macromolecules that make up an animal are not identical to those of its food. In building their macromolecules, however, all organisms use common monomers--for example, soybeans, fruit flies, and humans all assemble their proteins from the same 20 amino acids.

Digestion, the second stage of food processing, is the process of breaking food down into molecules small enough for the body to absorb. Digestion cleaves macromolecules into their component monomers, which the animal then uses to make its own molecules or as fuel for ATP production. Polysaccharides and disaccharides are split into simple sugars, fats are digested to glycerol and fatty acids, proteins are broken down into amino acids, and nucleic acids are cleaved into nucleotides.

Recall from Chapter 5 that when a cell makes a macromolecule by linking together monomers, it does so by removing a molecule of water for each new covalent bond formed. Digestion reverses this process by breaking bonds with the enzymatic addition of water (see FIGURE 5.2). This splitting process is called enzymatic hydrolysis. A variety of hydrolytic enzymes catalyze the digestion of each of the classes of macromolecules found in food. This chemical digestion is usually preceded by mechanical fragmentation of the food--by chewing, for instance. Breaking food into smaller pieces increases the surface area exposed to digestive juices containing hydrolytic enzymes.

The last two stages of food processing occur after the food is digested. In the third stage, absorption, the animal's cells take up (absorb) small molecules such as amino acids and simple sugars from the digestive compartment. Finally, elimination occurs, as undigested material passes out of the digestive compartment.





 Digestion occurs in specialized compartments

How do animals apply their digestive processes to food without digesting their own cells and tissues? After all, digestive enzymes hydrolyze the same biological materials (such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) that animals are made of, and it is obviously important to avoid digesting oneself! Most animals reduce the risk of self-digestion by processing food in specialized compartments.

Intracellular Digestion

Food vacuoles--organelles in which hydrolytic enzymes break down food without digesting the cell's own cytoplasm--are the simplest digestive compartments. Heterotrophic protists digest their meals in food vacuoles, usually after engulfing food by phagocytosis or pinocytosis (see FIGURE 8.19a). Newly formed food vacuoles fuse with lysosomes, which are organelles containing hydrolytic enzymes. This mixes the food with the enzymes, allowing digestion to occur safely within a compartment that is enclosed by a protective membrane. This is termed intracellular digestion (FIGURE 41.10). Sponges are unusual among animals in that they digest their food entirely by the intracellular mechanism, as do heterotrophic protists (which are not animals) (see FIGURE 33.3).

Fig 41-10. Intracellular digestion in Paramecium.

Extracellular Digestion

In most animals, at least some hydrolysis occurs by extracellular digestion, the breakdown of food outside cells. Extracellular digestion occurs within compartments that are continuous with the outside of the animal's body. Having an extracellular cavity for digestion enables an animal to devour much larger prey than can be ingested by phagocytosis and digested intracellularly.

Many animals with simple body plans have digestive sacs with single openings. These pouches, called gastrovascular cavities, function in both digestion and distribution of nutrients throughout the body (hence, the vascular part of the term). The cnidarians called hydras provide a good example of how a gastrovascular cavity works. Hydras are carnivores that sting prey with specialized organelles called nematocysts and then use tentacles to stuff the food through the mouth into the gastrovascular cavity (FIGURE 41.11). With food in the cavity, specialized cells of the gastrodermis, the tissue layer that lines the cavity, secrete digestive enzymes that break the soft tissues of the prey into tiny pieces. Gastrodermal cells then engulf the food particles, and most of the actual hydrolysis of macromolecules occurs intracellularly, as in Paramecium and sponges. After a hydra has digested its meal, undigested materials remaining in the gastrovascular cavity, such as the exoskeletons of small crustaceans, are eliminated through the single opening, which functions in the dual role of mouth and anus. Many flatworms also have a gastrovascular cavity with a single opening (see FIGURE 33.10).

Fig 41-11. Extracellular digestion in a gastrovascular cavity. The outer epidermis of the cnidarian hydra has protective and sensory functions, whereas the inner gastrodermis is specialized for digestion. Digestion begins in the gastrovascular cavity and is completed intracellularly after small food particles are engulfed by the gastrodermal cells.

In contrast to cnidarians and flatworms, most animals--including nematodes, annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates--have digestive tubes extending between two openings, a mouth and an anus. These tubes are called complete digestive tracts or alimentary canals. Because food moves along the canal in one direction, the tube can be organized into specialized regions that carry out digestion and nutrient absorption in a stepwise fashion (FIGURE 41.12). Food ingested through the mouth and pharynx passes through an esophagus that leads to a crop, gizzard, or stomach, depending on the species. Crops and stomachs usually serve as food storage organs (although some digestion may occur there), whereas gizzards grind and fragment food. The food next enters the intestine, where digestive enzymes hydrolyze the food molecules, and nutrients are absorbed across the lining of the tube into the blood. Undigested wastes are eliminated through the anus. Another advantage of a complete digestive tract is the ability to ingest additional food before earlier meals are completely digested--which may be difficult or inefficient for animals with gastrovascular cavities.

 The oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus initiate food processing

The Oral Cavity

Both physical and chemical digestion of food begin in the mouth. During chewing, teeth of various shapes cut, smash, and grind food, making it easier to swallow and increasing its surface area. The presence of food in the oral cavity triggers a nervous reflex that causes the salivary glands to deliver saliva through ducts to the oral cavity. Even before food is actually in the mouth, salivation may occur in anticipation because of learned associations between eating and the time of day, cooking odors, or other stimuli. In humans, more than a liter of saliva is secreted each day.

Saliva contains a slippery glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called mucin, which protects the soft lining of the mouth from abrasion and lubricates the food for easier swallowing. Saliva also contains buffers that help prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acid in the mouth. Antibacterial agents in saliva kill many of the bacteria that enter the mouth with food.

Chemical digestion of carbohydrates, a main source of chemical energy, begins in the oral cavity. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes starch (a glucose polymer from plants) and glycogen (a glucose polymer from animals). The main products of this enzyme's action are smaller polysaccharides and the disaccharide maltose.

The tongue tastes food, manipulates it during chewing, and helps shape the food into a ball called a bolus. During swallowing, the tongue pushes a bolus to the back of the oral cavity and into the pharynx.

The Pharynx

The region we call our throat is the pharynx, a junction that opens to both the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea). When we swallow, the top of the windpipe moves up so that its opening, the glottis, is blocked by a cartilaginous flap, the epiglottis. You can see this motion in the bobbing of the "Adam's apple" during swallowing. This carefully controlled mechanism normally ensures that a bolus will be guided into the entrance of the esophagus (FIGURE 41.14, steps one and two). On rare occasions when food or liquids go "down the wrong pipe" because the swallowing reflex didn't close the opening of the windpipe in time, the blockage of airflow to the lungs can be fatal.

Fig 41-14. From mouth to stomach: the swallowing reflex and esophageal peristalsis.

The Esophagus

The esophagus conducts food from the pharynx down to the stomach by peristalsis (FIGURE 41.14, step six). The muscles at the very top of the esophagus are striated (voluntary). Thus, the act of swallowing begins voluntarily, but then the involuntary waves of contraction by smooth muscles in the rest of the esophagus take over.





 The stomach stores food and performs preliminary digestion

The stomach is located in the upper abdominal cavity, just below the diaphragm. With accordionlike folds and a very elastic wall, the stomach can stretch to accommodate about 2 L of food and fluid. Because this large organ can store an entire meal, we do not need to eat constantly. Besides storing food, the stomach performs important digestive functions: it secretes a digestive fluid called gastric juice and mixes this secretion with the food by the churning action of the smooth muscles in the stomach wall.

Gastric juice is secreted by the epithelium lining numerous deep pits in the stomach wall. With a high concentration of hydrochloric acid, gastric juice has a pH of about 2--acidic enough to dissolve iron nails. One function of the acid is to disrupt the extracellular matrix that binds cells together in meat and plant material. The acid also kills most bacteria that are swallowed with food. Also present in gastric juice is pepsin, an enzyme that begins the hydrolysis of proteins. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds adjacent to specific amino acids, cleaving proteins into smaller polypeptides. Pepsin is one of the few enzymes that works best in a strongly acidic environment. The low pH of gastric juice denatures (unfolds) the proteins in food, increasing exposure of their peptide bonds to pepsin.

What prevents pepsin from destroying the cells of the stomach wall? First, pepsin is secreted in an inactive form called pepsinogen by specialized cells called chief cells located in gastric pits (FIGURE 41.15). Other cells, called parietal cells, also in the pits, secrete hydrochloric acid. The acid converts pepsinogen to active pepsin by removing a small portion of the molecule and exposing its active site. Because different cells secrete the acid and pepsinogen, the two ingredients do not mix--and pepsinogen is not activated--until they enter the lumen of the stomach. Activation of pepsinogen is an example of positive feedback. Once some pepsinogen is activated by acid, activation occurs at an increasingly rapid rate because pepsin itself can activate additional molecules of pepsinogen. Many other digestive enzymes are also secreted in inactive forms that become active within the lumen of the digestive tract.

Fig 41-15. Secretion of gastric juice.

The stomach's second defense against self-digestion is a coating of mucus, secreted by the epithelial cells, that helps protect the stomach lining. Still, the epithelium is constantly eroded, and mitosis generates enough cells to completely replace the stomach lining every three days. Gastric ulcers, lesions in the stomach lining, are caused mainly by the acid-tolerant bacterium Helicobacter pylori and are treated with antibiotics. However, gastric ulcers may worsen if pepsin and acid destroy the lining faster than it can regenerate.

About every 20 seconds, the stomach contents are mixed by the churning action of smooth muscles. You may feel hunger pangs when your empty stomach churns. (Sensations of hunger are also associated with brain centers that monitor the blood's nutritional status.) As a result of mixing and enzyme action, what begins in the stomach as a recently swallowed meal becomes a nutrient-rich broth known as acid chyme.

Most of the time, the stomach is closed off at either end (see FIGURE 41.13). The opening from the esophagus to the stomach, the cardiac orifice, normally dilates only when a bolus driven by peristalsis arrives. The occasional backflow of acid chyme from the stomach into the lower end of the esophagus causes heartburn. (If backflow is a persistent problem, an ulcer may develop in the esophagus.) At the opening from the stomach to the small intestine is the pyloric sphincter, which helps regulate the passage of chyme into the intestine. A squirt at a time, it takes about 2 to 6 hours after a meal for the stomach to empty.





 The small intestine is the major organ of digestion and absorption

With a length of more than 6 m in humans, the small intestine is the longest section of the alimentary canal (its name is based on its small diameter, compared with the large intestine). Most of the enzymatic hydrolysis of food macromolecules and most of the absorption of nutrients into the blood occurs in the small intestine.

The first 25 cm or so of the small intestine is called the duodenum. It is here that acid chyme from the stomach mixes with digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and gland cells of the intestinal wall itself (FIGURE 41.16). The pancreas produces several hydrolytic enzymes and an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate. The bicarbonate acts as a buffer, offsetting the acidity of chyme from the stomach.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 41-16. The duodenum. As peristalsis squeezes the mixture of digestive juices and partially-digested food along the small intestine, hydrolytic enzymes break the food molecules down to monomers.

The liver performs a wide variety of important functions in the body, including the production of bile, a mixture of substances that is stored in the gallbladder until needed. Bile contains no digestive enzymes, but it does contain bile salts, which act as detergents that aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. Bile also contains pigments that are by-products of red blood cell destruction in the liver; these bile pigments are eliminated from the body with the feces.

Enzymatic Action in the Small Intestine

Let's now follow the action of enzymes from the pancreas and intestinal (duodenal) wall in digesting macromolecules.

Carbohydrate Digestion. The digestion of starch and glycogen begun by salivary amylase in the oral cavity continues in the small intestine (FIGURE 41.17, p. 864). Pancreatic amylases hydrolyze starch, glycogen, and smaller polysaccharides into disaccharides. The enzyme maltase completes the digestion of maltose, splitting it into two molecules of the simple sugar glucose. Maltase is one of a family of disaccharidases, each one specific for hydrolysis of a different disaccharide. Sucrase, for instance, hydrolyzes table sugar (sucrose), and lactase digests lactose, a sugar found in milk (adults usually have much less lactase and therefore less ability to digest milk sugar than children have). The disaccharidases are built into the membranes and extracellular matrix covering the intestinal epithelium, which is also the site of sugar absorption. Thus, the terminal steps in carbohydrate digestion--the steps that yield energy-rich monomers--occur where these monomers are absorbed into the blood.

Fig 41-17. Enzymatic digestion in the human digestive system.

Protein Digestion. Digestion of proteins in the small intestine completes the process begun by pepsin in the stomach (FIGURE 41.17b). Several enzymes in the duodenum dismantle polypeptides into their component amino acids or into small peptides that in turn are attacked by other enzymes. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are specific for peptide bonds adjacent to certain amino acids, and thus, like pepsin, break large polypeptides into shorter chains. Enzymes called dipeptidases, attached to the intestinal lining, split small peptides. Carboxypeptidase splits off one amino acid at a time, beginning at the end of the polypeptide that has a free carboxyl group. Aminopeptidase works in the opposite direction. Either aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase alone could eventually completely digest a protein, but the teamwork among the various enzymes speeds up hydrolysis tremendously.

Many of the protein-digesting enzymes, such as aminopeptidase, are secreted by the intestinal epithelium, but trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase are secreted in inactive forms by the pancreas. Another intestinal enzyme, called enteropeptidase, directly or indirectly triggers activation of these enzymes within the intestinal lumen (FIGURE 41.18).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 41-18. Activation of protein-digesting enzymes in the small intestine. The pancreas secretes protein-digesting enzymes in an inactive form into the lumen of the duodenum. An enzyme called enteropeptidase, which is bound to the intestinal epithelium, converts trypsinogen to trypsin. Trypsin then activates procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen. ( indicates activation.)

Nucleic Acid Digestion. The digestion of nucleic acids involves a hydrolytic assault similar to that mounted on proteins. A team of enzymes called nucleases hydrolyze DNA and RNA into their component nucleotides (FIGURE 41.17c). Other hydrolytic enzymes then break nucleotides down further into nucleosides, nitrogenous bases, sugars, and phosphates.

Fat Digestion. Nearly all the fat in a meal reaches the small intestine completely undigested. Hydrolysis of fats is a special problem, because fat molecules are insoluble in water. However, bile salts from the gallbladder secreted into the duodenum coat tiny fat droplets and keep them from coalescing, a process called emulsification. Because the droplets are small, a large surface area of fat is exposed to lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the fat molecules (FIGURE 41.17d).

Thus, the macromolecules from food are completely hydrolyzed to their component monomers as peristalsis moves the mixture of chyme and digestive juices along the small intestine. Most digestion is completed early in this journey, while the chyme is still in the duodenum. The remaining regions of the small intestine, the jejunum and ileum, function mainly in the absorption of nutrients and water.

Absorption of Nutrients

To enter the body, nutrients in the lumen must cross the lining of the digestive tract. A few nutrients are absorbed in the stomach and large intestine, but most absorption occurs in the small intestine. This organ has a huge surface area--300 m2, roughly the size of a tennis court. Large circular folds in the lining bear fingerlike projections called villi, and each epithelial cell of a villus has many microscopic appendages called microvilli that are exposed to the intestinal lumen. This enormous microvillar surface is an adaptation that greatly increases the rate of nutrient absorption (FIGURE 41.19).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 41-19. The structure of the small intestine.

Penetrating the core of each villus is a net of microscopic blood vessels (capillaries) and a small vessel of the lymphatic system called a lacteal. (In addition to their circulatory system, vertebrates have an associated network of vessels--the lymphatic system--that carries a clear fluid called lymph, discussed in Chapter 43.) Nutrients are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium and then across the unicellular epithelium of the capillaries or lacteals. Only these two single layers of epithelial cells separate nutrients in the lumen of the intestine from the bloodstream.

In some cases, transport of nutrients across the epithelial cells is passive. The simple sugar fructose, for example, apparently moves by diffusion down its concentration gradient from the lumen of the intestine into the epithelial cells, and then into capillaries. Other nutrients, including amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and glucose and several other simple sugars, are pumped against concentration gradients by the epithelial membranes. This active transport allows the intestine to absorb a much higher proportion of the nutrients in the intestine than would be possible with passive diffusion.

Amino acids and sugars pass through the epithelium, enter capillaries, and are carried away from the intestine by the bloodstream. After glycerol and fatty acids are absorbed by epithelial cells, they are recombined into fats within those cells. The fats are then mixed with cholesterol and coated with special proteins, forming small globules called chylomicrons, most of which are transported by exocytosis out of the epithelial cells and into lacteals. The lacteals converge into the larger vessels of the lymphatic system. Lymph, containing chylomicrons, eventually drains from the lymphatic system into large veins that return blood to the heart.

In contrast to the lacteals, the capillaries and veins that drain the nutrients away from the villi all converge into the hepatic portal vessel, which leads directly to the liver. This ensures that the liver--which has the metabolic versatility to interconvert various organic molecules--has first access to amino acids and sugars absorbed after a meal is digested. There fore, blood that leaves the liver may have a very different balance of these nutrients than the blood that entered via the hepatic portal vessel. For example, the liver helps regulate the level of glucose molecules in the blood, and blood exiting the liver usually has a glucose concentration very close to 0.1% , regardless of the carbohydrate content of a meal (see FIGURE 41.1). From the liver, blood travels to the heart, which pumps the blood and the nutrients it contains to all parts of the body.

Digestive Efficiency and Cost

The digestive and absorptive processes are very effective in obtaining energy and nutrients. People eating the typical diets consumed in developed countries usually absorb 80 to 90 percent of the organic matter in their food. Much of the remaining undigestible material is cellulose from plant cell walls, and thus diets containing lots of fresh vegetables are not absorbed as completely as diets that are rich in meats, fats, or simple carbohydrates.

Because digestion and absorption depend on such active mechanisms as peristalsis, enzyme secretion, and active transport, there is a substantial energy cost to processing food. Depending on the animal species and the diet, digesting and absorbing a meal may require the animal to expend an amount of energy equal to between 3%  and 30%  of the chemical energy contained in the meal.





 Hormones help regulate digestion

Many animals go for long intervals between meals and do not need to run their digestive systems continuously. Hormones released by the wall of the stomach and duodenum help ensure that digestive secretions are present only when needed. When we see, smell, or taste food, impulses from the brain to the stomach initiate the secretion of gastric juice. Then certain substances in the food stimulate the stomach wall to release the hormone gastrin into the circulatory system. As gastrin gradually recirculates in the bloodstream back to the stomach wall, the hormone stimulates further secretion of gastric juice. Thus, an initial burst of gastric secretion at mealtime is followed by a sustained secretion that continues to add gastric juice to the food for some time. If the pH of the stomach contents becomes too low, the acid will inhibit the release of gastrin, decreasing the secretion of gastric juice; this is an example of negative feedback.

Other hormones, collectively called enterogastrones, are secreted by the wall of the duodenum. The acidic pH of the chyme that enters the duodenum stimulates cells in the wall to release the hormone secretin. This enterogastrone signals the pancreas to release bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acid chyme. A second enterogastrone, cholecystokinin (CCK), is secreted in response to the presence of amino acids or fatty acids. CCK causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the small intestine. CCK also triggers the release of pancreatic enzymes. The chyme, particularly if rich in fats, also causes the duodenum to release other enterogastrones that inhibit peristalsis in the stomach, thereby slowing down the entry of food into the small intestine.





 Reclaiming water is a major function of the large intestine

The large intestine, or colon, is connected to the small intestine at a T-shaped junction, where a sphincter (a muscular valve) controls the movement of material. One arm of the T is a pouch called the cecum (see FIGURE 41.13). Compared to many other mammals, humans have a relatively small cecum with a fingerlike extension, the appendix, which is dispens able. (Lymphoid tissue in the appendix makes a minor contribution to body defense.) The main branch of the human colon is shaped like an upside-down U about 1.5 m long.

A major function of the colon is to recover water that has entered the alimentary canal as the solvent of the various digestive juices. About 7 L of fluid are secreted into the lumen of the digestive tract each day, which is much more liquid than most people drink. Most of this water is reabsorbed along with nutrient absorption in the small intestine. The colon reclaims much of the remaining water in the lumen. Together, the small intestine and colon reabsorb about 90%  of the water that entered the alimentary canal. The wastes of the digestive tract, the feces, become more solid as they are moved along the colon by peristalsis. The movement is sluggish, and it generally takes about 12 to 24 hours for material to travel the length of the organ. If the lining of the colon is irritated--by a viral or bacterial infection, for instance--less water than normal may be reabsorbed, resulting in diarrhea. The opposite problem, constipation, occurs when peristalsis moves the feces along too slowly. An excess of water is reabsorbed, and the feces become compacted.

Living in the large intestine is a rich flora of mostly harmless bacteria. One of the common inhabitants of the human colon is Escherichia coli, a favorite research organism of molecular biologists (see Chapter 18). The presence of E. coli in lakes and streams is an indication of contamination by untreated sewage. Intestinal bacteria live on unabsorbed organic material. As by-products of their metabolism, many colon bacteria generate gases, including methane and hydrogen sulfide. Some of the bacteria produce vitamins, including biotin, folic acid, vitamin K, and several B vitamins. These vitamins, absorbed into the blood, supplement our dietary intake of vitamins.

Feces contain masses of bacteria, as well as cellulose and other undigested materials. Although cellulose fibers have no caloric value to humans, their presence in the diet helps move food along the digestive tract. Feces may also contain an abundance of salts. For instance, when iron and calcium concentrations in the blood get too high, the colon lining excretes salts of these elements into the lumen, and they are eliminated in the feces.

The terminal portion of the colon is called the rectum, where feces are stored until they can be eliminated. Between the rectum and the anus are two sphincters, one involuntary and the other voluntary. Once or more each day, strong contractions of the colon create an urge to defecate.





 Structural adaptations of digestive systems are often associated with diet

The digestive systems of mammals and other vertebrates are variations on a common plan, but there are many intriguing adaptations, often associated with the animal's diet. We will examine just a few.

Dentition, an animal's assortment of teeth, is one example of structural variation reflecting diet. Particularly in mammals, evolutionary adaptation of teeth for processing different kinds of food is one of the major reasons this vertebrate class has been so successful. Compare the dentition of carnivorous, herbivorous, and omnivorous mammals in FIGURE 41.20. Nonmammalian vertebrates generally have less specialized dentition, but there are interesting exceptions. For example, poisonous snakes, such as rattlesnakes, have fangs, modified teeth that inject venom into prey. Some fangs are hollow, like syringes, while others drip the poison along grooves on the surfaces of the teeth. All snakes have another important anatomical adaptation associated with feeding: They swallow their prey whole, with no chewing, and the lower jaw is loosely hinged to the skull by an elastic ligament that permits the mouth and throat to open very wide for swallowing impressively large prey (once again, witness the astonishing episode recorded in FIGURE 41.9). Large, expandable stomachs are common in carnivores, which may go for a long time between meals and therefore must eat as much as they can when they do catch prey. For example, a 200-kg African lion can consume 40 kg of meat in one meal.

Fig 41-20. Dentition and diet. (a) Carnivores, such as members of the dog and cat families, generally have pointed incisors and canines that can be used to kill prey and rip or cut away pieces of flesh. The jagged premolars and molars crush and shred food. (b) In contrast, herbivorous mammals, such as cows, usually have teeth with broad, ridged surfaces that grind tough plant material. The incisors and canines are generally modified for biting off pieces of vegetation. (c) Humans, being omnivores adapted for eating both vegetation and meat, have a relatively unspecialized dentition. The permanent (adult) set of teeth is 32 in number. Beginning at the midline of the upper and lower jaw are two blade-like incisors for biting, a pointed canine for tearing, two premolars for grinding, and three molars for crushing.

The length of the vertebrate digestive system is also correlated with diet. In general, herbivores and omnivores have longer alimentary canals relative to their body size than carnivores (FIGURE 41.21). Vegetation is more difficult to digest than meat because it contains cell walls. A longer tract furnishes more time for digestion and more surface area for the absorption of nutrients.

Fig 41-21. The digestive tracts of a carnivore (coyote) and a herbivore (koala) compared. Although these two mammals are about the same size, the koala's intestines are much longer, an adaptation that enhances processing of fibrous, protein-poor eucalyptus leaves from which it obtains virtually all its food and water. Extensive chewing chops the leaves into very small pieces, increasing exposure of the food to di-gestive juices. The koala's cecum--at 2 m, the longest of any animal of equivalent size--functions as a fermentation chamber where symbiotic bacteria convert the shredded leaves into a more nutritious diet.





 Symbiotic microorganisms help nourish many vertebrates

Herbivorous animals face a special challenge: much of the chemical energy in their diets is contained in the cellulose of plant cell walls, but animals do not produce enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose. Many vertebrates (as well as termites, whose wood diets are largely cellulose) solve this problem by housing large populations of symbiotic bacteria and protists in special fermetation chambers in their alimentary canals. These microorganisms do have enzymes that can digest cellulose to simple sugars and other compounds that the animal can absorb. In many cases the microorganisms can also use the sugars from digested cellulose along with minerals to make a variety of nutrients essential to the animal, such as vitamins and amino acids.

The location of symbiotic microbes in herbivores' digestive tracts varies depending on the type of animal. The hoatzin, an herbivorous bird that lives in South American rain forests, has a large, muscular crop (an esophageal pouch) that houses symbiotic microorganisms. Hard ridges in the wall of the crop grind plant leaves into small fragments, and the microorganisms break down cellulose. Many herbivorous mammals, including horses, house symbiotic microorganisms in a large cecum, the pouch where the small and large intestines connect. The symbiotic bacteria of rabbits and some rodents live in the large intestine as well as in the cecum. Since most nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, nourishing by-products of fermentation by bacteria in the large intestine are initially lost with the feces. Rabbits and rodents recover these nutrients by eating some of their feces and passing the food through the alimentary canal a second time. (The familiar rabbit "pellets," which are not reingested, are the feces eliminated after food has passed through the digestive tract twice.) The koala, an Australian marsupial, also has an enlarged cecum, where symbiotic bacteria ferment finely shredded eucalyptus leaves (see FIGURE 41.21). The most elaborate adaptations for a herbivorous diet have evolved in the ruminants, which include deer, cattle, and sheep (FIGURE 41.22).

Fig 41-22. Ruminant digestion. The stomach of a ruminant has four chambers. Because of the microbial action in the chambers, the diet from which a ruminant actually absorbs its nutrients is much richer than the grass the animal originally ate. In fact, a ruminant eating grass or hay obtains many of its nutrients by digesting the symbiotic microorganisms, which reproduce rapidly enough in the rumen to maintain a stable population.

Our focus in this chapter has been on provisioning the animal body to support both metabolic production of ATP and biosynthesis. We have examined the nutritional requirements of animals and some of the many ways animals obtain nutrients for fuel and building materials. In the next chapter we will see that obtaining food, digesting it, and absorbing nutrients are only parts of a larger story. Provisioning the body also involves distributing nutrients to cells throughout the body and exchanging respiratory gases with the environment.

Every organism must exchange materials and energy with its environment, and this exchange ultimately occurs at the cellular level. Cells live in aqueous surroundings; the resources they need, such as nutrients and oxygen, move across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, and metabolic wastes, such as carbon dioxide, move out of the cell.

The feathery external gills projecting from the salmon shown above present an expansive surface area to the outside environment. A network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) lies close to the outside surface of the gills. Oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water diffuses across the thin epithelium covering the gills and into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses out into the water.

Salmon and most other animals have organ systems specialized for exchanging materials with the environment, and many have an internal transport system that conveys fluid (blood or interstitial fluid) throughout the body.

In this chapter you will learn about mechanisms of internal transport in animals. You will also learn about one of the most important cases of chemical transfer between animals and their environment: the exchange of the gases oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is essential to cellular respiration and bioenergetics.

 Transport systems functionally connect the organs of exchange with the body cells: an overview

Diffusion alone is not adequate for transporting substances over long distances in animals--for example, for moving glucose from the digestive tract and oxygen from the lungs to the brain of a mammal. Diffusion is insufficient over distances of more than a few millimeters, because the time it takes for a substance to diffuse from one place to another is proportional to the square of the distance. For example, if it takes 1 second for a given quantity of glucose to diffuse 100 mm, it will take 100 seconds for the same quantity to diffuse 1 mm and almost three hours to diffuse 1 cm. The circulatory system solves this problem by ensuring that no substance must diffuse very far to enter or leave a cell. By rapidly transporting fluid in bulk throughout the body, it functionally connects the aqueous environment of the body cells to the organs that exchange gases, absorb nutrients, and dispose of wastes. In the lungs of a mammal, for example, oxygen from inhaled air diffuses across a thin epithelium and into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction. Bulk fluid movement in the circulatory system, powered by the heart, then quickly carries the oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body. As the blood streams through the tissues within microscopic vessels called capillaries, chemicals are transported between the blood and the interstitial fluid that directly bathes the cells.

Internal transport and gas exchange are functionally related in most animals; thus, we focus on both the circulatory and respiratory systems in this chapter. We also highlight the role of these two organ systems in homeostasis (see Chapter 40)--for example, in regulating the interstitial fluid's content of nutrients and wastes. Let's turn first to some of the ways fluids circulate within animals.





 Most invertebrates have a gastrovascular cavity or a circulatory system for internal transport

Gastrovascular Cavities

The body plan of a hydra and other cnidarians makes a circulatory system unnecessary. A body wall only two cells thick encloses a central gastrovascular cavity, which serves for both digestion and for distribution of substances throughout the body (see FIGURE 41.11). The fluid inside the cavity is continuous with the water outside through a single opening; thus, both inner and outer tissue layers are bathed by fluid. Thin branches of the gastrovascular cavity extend into the tentacles of a hydra, and some cnidarians have even more elaborate gastrovascular cavities (FIGURE 42.1). Since digestion begins in the cavity, only the cells of the inner layer have direct access to nutrients, but the nutrients have only a short distance to diffuse to the cells of the outer layer.

Fig 42-1. Internal transport in the cnidarian Aurelia. The mouth leads to an elaborate gastrovascular cavity (shown in blue) that has branches radiating to and from a circular canal. Ciliated cells lining the canals circulate fluid in the directions indicated by the arrows. The animal is viewed here from its underside (oral surface).

Planarians and most other flatworms also have gastrovascular cavities that exchange materials with the environment through a single opening (see FIGURE 33.10). The flat shape of the body and the branching of the gastrovascular cavity throughout the animal ensure that all cells are bathed by a suitable medium and diffusion distances are short.

Open and Closed Circulatory Systems

For animals with many cell layers, gastrovascular cavities are insufficient for internal transport because diffusion distances are too great for adequate exchange of nutrients and wastes. In these more complex animals, two types of circulatory systems that overcome the limitations of diffusion have evolved: open circulatory systems and closed circulatory systems. Both have three basic components: a circulatory fluid (blood), a set of tubes (blood vessels) through which the blood moves through the body, and a muscular pump (the heart). The heart powers circulation by using metabolic energy to elevate the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, which then flows down a pressure gradient through its circuit and then back to the heart. This blood pressure is the motive force for fluid movement in the circulatory system.

In insects, other arthropods, and most mollusks, blood bathes the organs directly in an open circulatory system (FIGURE 42.2a). There is no distinction between blood and interstitial fluid, and the general body fluid is more correctly termed hemolymph. One or more hearts pump the hemolymph into an interconnected system of sinuses, which are spaces surrounding the organs. Here, chemical exchange occurs between the hemolymph and body cells. In insects and other arthropods, the heart is an elongated tube located dorsally. When the heart contracts, it pumps hemolymph through vessels out into sinuses. When the heart relaxes, it draws hemolymph into the circulatory system through pores called ostia. Body movements that squeeze the sinuses help circulate the hemolymph.

Fig 42-2. Open and closed circulatory systems.

In a closed circulatory system, blood is confined to vessels and is distinct from the interstitial fluid (FIGURE 42.2b). One or more hearts pump blood into large vessels that branch into smaller ones coursing through the organs. Here, materials are exchanged by diffusion between the blood and the interstitial fluid bathing the cells. Earthworms, squids, octopuses, and vertebrates have closed circulatory systems.





 Vertebrate phylogeny is reflected in adaptations of the cardiovascular system

Humans and other vertebrates have a closed circulatory system, often called the cardiovascular system. The heart has one atrium or two atria (plural), the chambers that receive blood returning to the heart, and one or two ventricles, the chambers that pump blood out of the heart. Arteries, veins, and capillaries are the three main kinds of blood vessels, which in the human body extend a total distance of about 100,000 km. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to organs throughout the body. Within organs, arteries branch into arterioles, small vessels that convey blood to the capillaries. Capillaries are microscopic vessels with very thin, porous walls. Networks of these vessels, called capillary beds, infiltrate each tissue. It is across the thin walls of capillaries that chemicals, including dissolved gases, are exchanged by diffusion between the blood and the interstitial fluid surrounding the cells. At their "downstream" end, capillaries converge into venules, and venules converge into veins, which return blood to the heart. Notice that arteries and veins are distinguished by the direction in which they carry blood, not by the characteristics of the blood they contain. All arteries carry blood from the heart toward capillaries, and veins return blood to the heart from capillaries. The cardiovascular systems of different vertebrate taxa are variations of this general scheme, but they have been modified by natural selection.

Metabolic rate is an important factor in the evolution of cardiovascular systems. In general, animals with high metabolic rates have more complex circulatory systems and more powerful hearts than animals with low metabolic rates. Similarly, the complexity and number of blood vessels in a particular organ are correlated with that organ's metabolic requirements. Perhaps the most fundamental differences in cardiovascular adaptations are associated with gill breathing in aquatic vertebrates compared with lung breathing in terrestrial vertebrates.

A fish heart has two main chambers, one atrium and one ventricle (FIGURE 42.3a). Blood pumped from the ventricle travels first to the gills (the gill circulation), where it picks up oxygen and disposes of carbon dioxide across capillary walls (see photo on p. 871). The gill capillaries converge into a vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood to capillary beds in all other parts of the body (the systemic circulation). Blood then returns in veins to the atrium of the heart. Notice that in a fish, blood must pass through two capillary beds during each circuit. When blood flows through a capillary bed, blood pressure--the motive force for circulation--drops substantially (for reasons that will be explained shortly). Therefore, oxygen-rich blood leaving the gills flows to the systemic circulation quite slowly (although the process is aided by body movements during swimming). This constrains the delivery of oxygen to body tissues, and hence the maximum aerobic metabolic rate of fishes.

Fig 42-3. Generalized circulatory schemes of vertebrates. Red symbolizes oxygen-rich blood, and blue represents oxygen-poor blood. (a) Fishes have a two-chambered heart and a single circuit of blood flow. (b) Amphibians have a three-chambered heart and two circuits of blood flow: pulmocutaneous and systemic. This double circulation delivers blood to systemic organs under high pressure. In the single ventricle, there is some mixing of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. (It is customary to illustrate cardiovascular systems with the right side of the heart on the left and the left side on the right, as if the body is facing you from the page.) (c) Mammals have a four-chambered heart and double circulation. Within the heart, oxygen-rich blood is kept completely segregated from oxygen-poor blood.

Frogs and other amphibians have a three-chambered heart, with two atria and one ventricle (FIGURE 42.3b). The ventricle pumps blood into a forked artery that splits the ventricle's output into the pulmocutaneous and systemic circulations. The pulmocutaneous circulation leads to capillaries in the gas-exchange organs (the lungs and skin in a frog), where the blood picks up oxygen and releases CO2 before returning to the heart's left atrium. Most of the returning oxygen-rich blood is pumped into the systemic circulation, which supplies all body organs and then returns oxygen-poor blood to the right atrium via the veins. This scheme, called double circulation, provides a vigorous flow of blood to the brain, muscles, and other organs because the blood is pumped a second time after it loses pressure in the capillary beds of the lungs or skin. This is distinctly different from the single circulation in the fish, where blood flows directly from the respiratory organs (gills) to other organs under reduced pressure.

In the ventricle of the frog, there is some mixing of oxygen-rich blood that has returned from the lungs with oxygen-poor blood that has returned from the rest of the body. However, a ridge within the ventricle diverts most of the oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium into the systemic circuit and most of the oxygen-poor blood from the right atrium into the pulmocutaneous circuit. Reptiles also have double circulation with pulmonary (lung) and systemic circuits, but there is even less mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood than in amphibians. Although the reptilian heart is three-chambered, the ventricle is partially divided.

In one order of reptiles, the crocodilians (crocodiles and alligators), and in all birds and mammals, the ventricle is completely divided into separate right and left chambers (FIGURE 42.3c). In this arrangement the left side of the heart receives and pumps only oxygen-rich blood, while the right side handles only oxygen-poor blood. Oxygen delivery is enhanced because there is no mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood, and double circulation restores pressure to the systemic circuit after blood has passed through the lung capillaries.

The evolution of a powerful four-chambered heart was an essential adaptation in support of the endothermic way of life characteristic of birds and mammals. Endotherms use about ten times as much energy as equal-sized ectotherms, and therefore their circulatory systems need to deliver about ten times as much fuel and oxygen to their tissues (and remove ten times as much CO2 and other wastes). This large traffic of substances is made possible by their separate and independent systemic and pulmonary circulations, and by having large and powerful hearts to pump the necessary volume of blood. Birds and mammals descended from different reptilian ancestors, and their powerful four-chambered hearts evolved independently--an example of convergent evolution.





 Double circulation in mammals depends on the anatomy and pumping cycle of the heart

A more detailed diagram of blood flow through the mammalian cardiovascular system is shown in FIGURE 42.4, which has numbers keyed to the circled numbers in this text discussion. Beginning our tour with the pulmonary (lung) circuit, 
			  
		the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs via 
			  
		the pulmonary arteries. As the blood flows through 
			  
		capillary beds in the right and left lungs, it loads oxygen and unloads carbon dioxide. Oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins to 
			  
		the left atrium of the heart. Next, the oxygen-rich blood flows into 
			  
		the left ventricle, as the ventricle opens and the atrium contracts. The left ventricle pumps the oxygen-rich blood out to body tissues through the systemic circuit. Blood leaves the left ventricle via 
			  
		the aorta, which conveys blood to arteries leading throughout the body. The first branches from the aorta are the coronary arteries (not shown), which supply blood to the heart muscle itself. Then come branches leading to capillary beds 
			  
		in the head and arms (or forelimbs). The aorta continues in a posterior direction, supplying oxygen-rich blood to arteries leading to 
			  
		arterioles and capillary beds in the abdominal organs and legs. Within the capillaries, blood gives up much of its oxygen and picks up the carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration. Capillaries rejoin to form venules, which convey blood to veins. Oxygen-poor blood from the head, neck, and forelimbs is channeled into a large vein called 
			  
		the anterior (or superior) vena cava. Another large vein called 
			  
		the posterior (or inferior) vena cava drains blood from the trunk and hind limbs. The two venae cavae empty their blood into 
			  
		the right atrium, from which the oxygen-poor blood flows into the right ventricle.

Fig 42-4. The mammalian cardiovascular system: an overview. The circled numbers are keyed to the discussion in the text. It is as though we are tracking a single blood cell as it flows first through the pulmonary circuit and then through the systemic circuit. However, if we consider the circulatory system as a whole instead of focusing on the path of an individual cell, it is important to understand that the dual circuits operate simultaneously, not in the serial fashion that the numbering in the diagram suggests. The two ventricles pump almost in unison; while some blood is traveling in the pulmonary circuit, the rest of the blood is flowing in the systemic circuit.

The Mammalian Heart: A Closer Look

A closer look at the mammalian heart (using the human heart as an example) provides a better understanding of how double circulation works (FIGURE 42.5, p. 876). Located beneath the breastbone (sternum), the human heart is about the size of a clenched fist and consists mostly of cardiac muscle (see FIGURE 40.4). The two atria have relatively thin walls and function as collection chambers for blood returning to the heart, pumping blood only the short distance to the ventricles. The ventricles have thicker walls and contract much more strongly than the atria--especially the left ventricle, which must pump blood to all body organs through the systemic circuit.

Fig 42-5. The mammalian heart: a closer look. In this detailed view of the structure of the heart, notice the valves, which prevent backflow of blood within the heart, and the relative thickness of the walls of the heart chambers. The atria, which pump blood only into the ventricles, have thinner walls than the ventricles, which pump blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits.

The heart contracts and relaxes in a rhythmic cycle. When it contracts, it pumps blood; when it relaxes, its chambers fill with blood. One complete sequence of pumping and filling is called the cardiac cycle. The contraction phase of the cycle is called systole, and the relaxation phase is called diastole (FIGURE 42.6). The volume of blood per minute that the left ventricle pumps into the systemic circuit is called cardiac output. Cardiac output depends on two factors: the rate of contraction, or heart rate (number of beats per minute) and stroke volume, the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle in each contraction. The average stroke volume for a human is about 75 mL. A person with this stroke volume and a heart rate during rest of 70 beats per minute has a cardiac output of 5.25 L/min. This is about equivalent to the total volume of blood in the human body. Cardiac output can increase about fivefold during heavy exercise. This is equivalent to pumping an amount of blood matching an average person's body weight every 2-3 minutes.

Fig 42-6. The cardiac cycle. The heart contracts (systole) and relaxes (diastole) in a rhythmic cycle. For an adult human at rest with a pulse of about 75 beats per minute, one complete cardiac cycle takes about 0.8 sec. 
			  
		 During a relaxation phase (atria and ventricles in diastole) lasting about 0.4 sec, blood returning from the large veins flows into the atria and ventricles. 
			  
		 A brief period (about 0.1 sec) of atrial systole then forces all remaining blood out of the atria into the ventricles. 
			  
		 During the remaining 0.3 sec of the cycle, ventricular systole pumps blood into the large arteries. Note that seven-eighths of the time--all but 0.1 sec of the cardiac cycle--the atria are relaxed and filling with blood returning in the veins.

Four valves in the heart, each consisting of flaps of connective tissue, prevent backflow and keep blood moving in the correct direction (see FIGURE 42.5). Between each atrium and ventricle is an atrioventricular (AV) valve. The AV valves are anchored by strong fibers that prevent them from turning inside out. Pressure generated by the powerful contraction of the ventricles closes the AV valves, keeping blood from flowing back into the atria. Semilunar valves are located at the two exits of the heart, where the aorta leaves the left ventricle and the pulmonary artery leaves the right ventricle. These valves are forced open by pressure created by ventricular contraction. When the ventricles relax, blood starts to flow back toward the heart, closing the semilunar valves, which prevents blood from flowing back into the ventricles. The elastic walls of the arteries expand when they receive the blood expelled from the ventricles. By taking your pulse--the rhythmic stretching of arteries caused by the pressure of blood driven by the powerful contractions of the ventricles--you can measure your heart rate.

The heart sounds we can hear with a stethoscope are caused by the closing of the valves. (Even without a stethoscope, you can hear these sounds by pressing your ear tightly against the chest of a friend--a close friend.) The sound pattern is "lub-dup, lub-dup, lub-dup." The first heart sound ("lub") is created by the recoil of blood against the closed AV valves. The second sound ("dup") is the recoil of blood against the semilunar valves.

A defect in one or more of the valves causes a condition known as a heart murmur, which may be detectable as a hissing sound when a stream of blood squirts backward through a valve. Some people are born with heart murmurs, while others have their valves damaged by infection (from rheumatic fever, for instance). Most heart murmurs do not reduce the efficiency of blood flow enough to warrant surgery.

Maintaining the Heart's Rhythmic Beat

The timely delivery of oxygen to the body's organs is critical. For example, brain cells die within a few minutes if oxygen supply is interrupted. Thus, maintaining heart function is crucial for survival. Several mechanisms that assure the continuity and control of heartbeat have evolved.

Certain cells of vertebrate cardiac muscle are self-excitable, meaning they contract without any signal from the nervous system, even if removed from the heart and placed in tissue culture. Each of these cells has its own intrinsic contraction rhythm. How are their contractions coordinated in the intact heart? A region of the heart called the sinoatrial (SA) node, or pacemaker, sets the rate and timing at which all cardiac muscle cells contract. Composed of specialized muscle tissue, the SA node is located in the wall of the right atrium, near the point where the superior vena cava enters the heart (FIGURE 42.7).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 42-7. The control of heart rhythm. 
			  
		 The SA node, or pacemaker, sets the tempo of the heartbeat by generating electrical signals (gold) that 
			  
		 spread through both atria, making them contract simultaneously. The signals to contract are delayed at the AV node for about 0.1 sec, during which blood in the atria empties into the ventricles. 
			  
		 Specialized muscle fibers called bundle branches and Purkinje fibers then conduct the signals to the apex of the heart and 
			  
		 throughout the ventricular walls. The signals trigger powerful contractions of both ventricles from the apex toward the atria, driving blood into the large arteries. Gold color in the graphs at the bottom indicates the components of an electrocardiogram (ECG) corresponding to the sequence of electrical events in the heart. In step 4, the black portion of the ECG to the right of the gold "spike" represents electrical activity after the ventricles contract; during this phase of the ECG, the ventricles become re-primed electrically and thus are able to conduct the next round of contraction signals.

The SA node generates electrical impulses much like those produced by nerve cells. Because cardiac muscle cells are electrically coupled (by the intercalated discs between adjacent cells; see FIGURE 40.4), impulses from the SA node spread rapidly through the walls of the atria, making them contract in unison. The impulses also pass to another region of specialized muscle tissue, a relay point called the atrioventricular (AV) node, located in the wall between the right atrium and right ventricle. Here the impulses are delayed for about 0.1 sec before spreading to the walls of the ventricles, which ensures that the atria empty completely before the ventricles contract.

The impulses that travel through cardiac muscle during the heart cycle produce electrical currents that are conducted through body fluids to the skin, where the currents can be detected by electrodes and recorded as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).

The SA node sets the tempo for the entire heart, but is influenced by a variety of physiological cues. Two sets of nerves affect heart rate; one set speeds up the pacemaker, and the other set slows it down. Heart rate is a compromise regulated by the opposing actions of these two sets of nerves. The pacemaker is also influenced by hormones secreted into the blood by glands. For example, epinephrine, the "fight-or-flight" hormone from the adrenal glands, increases heart rate (see Chapter 45). Body temperature is another factor that affects the pacemaker. An increase of only 1&#176;C raises the heart rate by about 10 beats/min. This is the reason your pulse increases substantially when you have a fever. Heart rate also increases with exercise, an adaptation that enables the circulatory system to provide the additional oxygen needed by muscles hard at work.





 Structural differences of arteries, veins, and capillaries correlate with their different functions

All blood vessels are built of similar tissues. The walls of both arteries and veins, for instance, have three similar layers (FIGURE 42.8, p. 878). On the outside, a layer of connective tissue with elastic fibers allows the vessel to stretch and recoil. A middle layer contains smooth muscle and more elastic fibers. Lining the lumen of all blood vessels, including capillaries, is an endothelium, a single layer of flattened cells that provides a smooth surface that minimizes resistance to the flow of blood.

Structural differences correlate with the different functions of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries lack the two outer layers, and their very thin walls consist only of endothelium and its basement membrane. This facilitates the exchange of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells. Arteries have thicker middle and outer layers than veins. Blood flows through the vessels of the circulatory system at uneven speeds and pressures. The thicker walls of arteries provide strength to accommodate blood pumped rapidly and at high pressure by the heart, and their elasticity helps maintain blood pressure even when the heart relaxes between contractions. The thinner-walled veins convey blood back to the heart at low velocity and pressure. Blood flows through the veins mainly as a result of muscle action; whenever we move, our skeletal muscles pinch our veins and squeeze blood through them. Within large veins, flaps of tissue act as one-way valves that allow blood to flow only toward the heart (FIGURE 42.9).

Fig 42-9. Blood flow in veins. Contracting skeletal muscles squeeze the veins. Flaps of tissue within the veins act as one-way valves that keep blood moving only toward the heart. If we sit or stand too long, the lack of muscular activity causes our feet to swell with stranded blood unable to return to the heart.





 Physical laws governing the movement of fluids through pipes affect blood flow and blood pressure

Blood Flow Velocity

Blood travels over a thousand times faster in the aorta (about 30 cm/sec on average) than in capillaries (about 0.026 cm/sec). This velocity change follows from the law of continuity, which describes fluid movement through pipes. If a pipe's diameter changes over its length, a fluid will flow through narrower segments of the pipe faster than it flows through wider segments. The volume of flow per second must be constant through the entire pipe, so the fluid must flow faster as the cross-sectional area of the pipe narrows. For instance, compare the velocity of water squirted by a hose with and without a nozzle.

Based on the law of continuity, it may seem that blood should travel faster through capillaries than through arteries, because the diameter of capillaries is very small. However, it is the total cross-sectional area of capillaries that determines flow rate. Each artery conveys blood to such an enormous number of capillaries that the total cross-sectional area is much greater in capillary beds than in any other part of the circulatory system. For this reason, the blood slows substantially as it enters the arterioles from arteries, and slows further in the capillary beds. Capillaries are the only vessels with walls thin enough to permit the transfer of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid, and the slower flow of blood through these tiny vessels enhances this exchange. As blood leaves the capillary beds and passes to the venules and veins, it speeds up again as a result of the reduction in total cross-sectional area (FIGURE 42.10).

Fig 42-10. The interrelationship of blood flow velocity, cross-sectional area of blood vessels, and blood pressure. Blood flow velocity decreases markedly in the arterioles and is slowest in the capillaries, owing to an increase in total cross-sectional area. Blood pressure, the main force driving blood from the heart to the capillaries, is highest in the arteries. Peaks in blood pressure corresponding to ventricular systole alternate with lower blood pressures corresponding to diastole (elasticity in arterial walls keeps diastolic pressure from falling to zero). Resistance to flow through the arterioles and capillaries, due to contact of the blood with a greater surface area of endothelium, reduces blood pressure and eliminates pressure peaks.

Blood Pressure

Fluids exert a force called hydrostatic pressure against surfaces they contact, and it is that pressure that drives fluids through pipes. Fluids always flow from areas of high pressure to areas of lower pressure. The hydrostatic force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel and that propels blood is blood pressure. Blood pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins and is highest in arteries when the heart contracts during ventricular systole (systolic pressure; see FIGURE 42.10).

When you take your pulse by placing your fingers on your wrist, you can feel an artery bulge with each heartbeat. The surge of pressure is partly due to the narrow openings of arterioles impeding the exit of blood from the arteries. Thus, when the heart contracts, blood enters the arteries faster than it can leave, and the vessels stretch from the pressure. The elastic walls of the arteries snap back during diastole, but the heart contracts again before enough blood has flowed into the arterioles to completely relieve pressure in the arteries. This impedance by the arterioles is called peripheral resistance. As a consequence of the elastic arteries working against peripheral resistance, there is a substantial blood pressure even during diastole (diastolic pressure), and blood flows into arterioles and capillaries continuously (see FIGURE 42.10). As shown in FIGURE 42.11 on page 880, the arterial blood pressure of a healthy resting human oscillates between about 120 mm Hg at systole and 70 mm Hg at diastole.

Fig 42-11. Measurement of blood pressure. Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers separated by a slash; the first number is the systolic pressure; the second is the diastolic pressure.

Blood pressure is determined partly by cardiac output and partly by peripheral resistance. Contraction of smooth muscles in the walls of the arterioles constricts the tiny vessels, increases peripheral resistance, and therefore increases blood pressure upstream in the arteries. When the smooth muscles relax, the arterioles dilate, blood flow through the arterioles increases, and pressure in the arteries falls. Nerve impulses, hormones, and other signals control these arteriole wall muscles. Stress, both physical and emotional, can raise blood pressure by triggering nervous and hormonal responses that will constrict blood vessels.

Cardiac output is adjusted in concert with changes in peripheral resistance. This coordination of regulatory mechanisms maintains adequate blood flow as the demands on the circulatory system change. For example, during heavy exercise the arterioles in working muscles dilate. This response admits a greater flow of oxygen-rich blood to the muscles and also decreases peripheral resistance. By itself, this would cause a fall in blood pressure (and therefore blood flow) in the body as a whole. However, cardiac output increases, maintaining blood pressure and supporting the necessary increase in blood flow.

In large land animals, another factor that affects blood pressure is gravity. Besides the force needed to overcome peripheral resistance, additional pressure is necessary if blood must be pushed above the level of the heart. In a standing human, blood must rise about 0.35 m to get from the heart to the brain. This demands an extra 27 mm Hg of pressure, which requires the heart to expend more energy in its contraction cycle. The pumping challenge is much greater for animals with long necks. Standing giraffes need to pump blood as much as 2.5 m above the heart. That requires about 190 mm Hg of additional blood pressure in the left ventricle, and a giraffe's normal systolic pressure near the heart is over 250 mm Hg. (Systolic pressure that high would be extremely dangerous in a human.) Special check valves and sinuses, along with feedback mechanisms that reduce cardiac output, prevent this high pressure from damaging the giraffe's brain when it puts its head down to drink--a body position that causes blood to flow downhill almost 2 m from the heart, adding an extra 150 mm Hg of blood pressure in the arteries leading to the brain. Some physiologists speculate about blood pressure and cardiovascular adaptations in dinosaurs--some of which had necks almost 10 m long, requiring a systolic pressure of 760 mm Hg just to pump blood to the brain when the head was fully raised.

By the time blood reaches the veins, its pressure is not affected much by the action of the heart. This is because the blood encounters so much resistance as it passes through the millions of tiny arterioles and capillaries that the pressure generated by the pumping heart has been dissipated and can no longer propel the blood in the veins. How does blood return to the heart, especially when it must travel from the lower extremities against gravity? Rhythmic contractions of smooth muscles in the walls of venules and veins account for some movement of the blood. More importantly, the activity of skeletal muscles during exercise squeezes blood through the veins (see FIGURE 42.9). Also, when we inhale, the change in pressure within the thoracic (chest) cavity causes the venae cavae and other large veins near the heart to expand and fill with blood.





 Transfer of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid occurs across the thin walls of capillaries

Blood Flow Through Capillary Beds

At any given time, only about 5-10%  of the body's capillaries have blood flowing through them. However, each tissue has many capillaries, so every part of the body is supplied with blood at all times. Capillaries in the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver are usually filled to capacity, but in many other sites, the blood supply varies over time as blood is diverted from one destination to another. After a meal, for instance, blood supply to the digestive tract increases. During strenuous exercise, blood is diverted from the digestive tract and supplied more generously to skeletal muscles and skin. This is one reason heavy exercise immediately after eating a big meal may cause indigestion.

Two mechanisms, both dependent on smooth muscles controlled by nerve signals and hormones, regulate the distribution of blood in capillary beds. In one mechanism, contraction of the smooth muscle layer in the wall of an arteriole constricts the vessel, decreasing blood flow through it to a capillary bed. When the muscle layer relaxes, the arteriole dilates, allowing blood to enter the capillaries. In the other mechanism, rings of smooth muscle, called precapillary sphincters because they are located at the entrance to capillary beds, control the flow of blood between arterioles and venules (FIGURE 42.12).

Fig 42-12. Blood flow in capillary beds. Precapillary sphincters regulate the passage of blood into capillary beds. Some blood flows directly from arterioles to venules through capillaries called thoroughfare channels, which are always open.

Capillary Exchange

The all-important exchange of substances between the blood and the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells takes place across the thin endothelial walls of the capillaries. Some substances may be carried across an endothelial cell in vesicles that form by endocytosis on one side of the cell (see FIGURE 8.19) and then release their contents by exocytosis on the opposite side; others simply diffuse between the blood and the interstitial fluid. Small molecules, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, diffuse down concentration gradients across the endothelial cells. Diffusion can also occur through the clefts between adjoining cells. However, transport through these clefts occurs mainly by bulk flow due to fluid pressure. Blood pressure within the capillary pushes fluid (water and small solutes such as sugars, salts, oxygen, and urea) through the capillary clefts. This causes a net loss of fluid from the upstream end of the capillary (near an arteriole). Blood cells suspended in blood and most proteins dissolved in the blood are too large to pass readily through the endothelium and remain in the capillaries, causing an increase in blood osmolarity (solute concentration) as blood loses fluid during its passage through a capillary. The resulting osmotic gradient pulls water into the capillary by osmosis near the downstream (venule) end (FIGURE 42.13). About 85%  of the fluid that leaves the blood at the arterial end of a capillary bed reenters from the interstitial fluid at the venous end, and the remaining 15%  is eventually returned to the blood by the vessels of the lymphatic system.

Fig 42-13. The movement of fluid between capillaries and the interstitial fluid. Fluid flows out of a capillary at the upstream end near an arteriole and reenters a capillary down-stream near a venule. The direction of fluid movement across the capillary wall at any point depends on the difference between two opposing forces: blood pressure and osmotic pressure.





 The lymphatic system returns fluid to the blood and aids in body defense

So much blood passes through the capillaries that the cumulative loss of fluid adds up to about 4 L per day. There is also some leakage of blood proteins, even though the capillary wall is not very permeable to large molecules. The lost fluid and proteins return to the blood via the lymphatic system. Fluid enters this system by diffusing into tiny lymph capillaries intermingled among capillaries of the cardiovascular system. Once inside the lymphatic system, the fluid is called lymph; its composition is about the same as that of interstitial fluid. The lymphatic system drains into the circulatory system near the junction of the venae cavae with the right atrium (see FIGURE 43.4).

Lymph vessels, like veins, have valves that prevent the backflow of fluid toward the capillaries. Rhythmic contractions of the vessel walls help draw fluid into lymphatic capillaries. Also like veins, lymph vessels depend mainly on the movement of skeletal muscles to squeeze fluid toward the heart.

Along a lymph vessel are organs called lymph nodes. By filtering the lymph and attacking viruses and bacteria, lymph nodes play an important role in the body's defense. Inside a lymph node is a honeycomb of connective tissue with spaces filled by white blood cells specialized for defense. When the body is fighting an infection, these cells multiply rapidly, and the lymph nodes become swollen and tender (which is why your doctor checks for swollen lymph nodes in your neck).

The lymphatic system helps defend the body against infection and maintains the volume and protein concentration of the blood. You may also recall from Chapter 41 that the lymphatic system transports fats from the digestive tract to the circulatory system.





 Blood is a connective tissue with cells suspended in plasma

We now shift our focus from the tubes and pumps of circulatory systems to the fluids being circulated. In invertebrates with open circulations, blood (hemolymph) is not different from interstitial fluid. However, blood in the closed circulatory systems of vertebrates is a specialized connective tissue consisting of several kinds of cells suspended in a liquid matrix called plasma. If a blood sample is taken, the cells can be separated from plasma by spinning the whole blood in a centrifuge (an anticoagulant must be added to prevent the blood from clotting). The cellular elements (cells and cell fragments), which occupy about 45%  of the volume of blood, settle to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, forming a dense red pellet. Above this cellular pellet is the transparent, straw-colored plasma (FIGURE 42.14).

Fig 42-14. The composition of mammalian blood.

Plasma

Blood plasma is about 90%  water. Among its many solutes are inorganic salts in the form of dissolved ions, sometimes referred to as blood electrolytes. The combined concentration of these ions is important in maintaining osmotic balance of the blood. Some ions also help buffer the blood, which normally has a pH of 7.4 in humans. And the normal functioning of muscles and nerves depends on the concentration of key ions in the interstitial fluid, which reflects their concentration in plasma. The kidney maintains plasma electrolytes at precise concentrations, an example of homeostasis.

Another important class of solutes is the plasma proteins, which have many functions. Collectively, they act as buffers against pH changes, help maintain the osmotic balance between blood and interstitial fluid, and contribute to the blood's viscosity (thickness). The various types of plasma proteins also have specific functions. Some are escorts for lipids, which are insoluble in water and can travel in blood only when bound to proteins. Another class of proteins, the immunoglobulins or antibodies, help combat viruses and other foreign agents that invade the body (see Chapter 43). And the plasma proteins called fibrinogens are clotting factors that help plug leaks when blood vessels are injured. Blood plasma that has had these clotting factors removed is called serum.

Plasma also contains a wide variety of substances in transit from one part of the body to another, including nutrients, metabolic wastes, respiratory gases, and hormones. Blood plasma and interstitial fluid are similar in composition, except that plasma has a much higher protein concentration (capillary walls, remember, are not very permeable to proteins).

Cellular Elements

Suspended in blood plasma are two classes of cells: red blood cells, which transport oxygen, and white blood cells, which function in defense. A third cellular element, platelets, are pieces of cells that are involved in clotting.

Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are by far the most numerous blood cells. Each cubic millimeter of human blood contains 5 to 6 million red cells, and there are about 25 trillion of these cells in the body's 5 L of blood.

Red blood cells are an excellent example of the close relationship between structure and function. Their main function of oxygen transport depends on rapid diffusion of oxygen across the red cells' plasma membranes. Human erythrocytes are small biconcave disks (about 7-8.5 mm in diameter), thinner in the center than at the edges. Their small size and biconcave shape create a large surface area for the total population of red cells, and the greater the total area of red cell membrane in a given volume of blood, the more rapidly oxygen diffusion can occur. Mammalian erythrocytes lack nuclei, an unusual characteristic that leaves more space in the tiny cells for hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein that transports oxygen (see FIGURE 5.23b). Red blood cells also lack mitochondria and generate their ATP exclusively by anaerobic metabolism. Oxygen transport by erythrocytes would be less efficient if their own metabolism were aerobic and consumed some of the oxygen they carry.

Despite its small size, an erythrocyte contains about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin. Since each hemoglobin binds up to four molecules of O2, an erythrocyte can transport about a billion oxygen molecules. Researchers have recently found that hemoglobin binds the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) as well as O2. As red blood cells pass through the capillary beds of lungs, gills, or other respiratory organs, oxygen diffuses into the erythrocytes and hemoglobin binds O2 and NO. In the systemic capillaries, hemoglobin unloads oxygen, and it then diffuses into body cells. The NO relaxes the capillary walls, allowing them to expand, which probably helps deliver O2 to the cells.

There are five major types of white blood cells, or leukocytes: monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (see FIGURE 42.14). Their collective function is to fight infections. For example, monocytes and neutrophils are phagocytes, which engulf and digest bacteria and debris from our own dead cells. As we will see in Chapter 43, lymphocytes develop into specialized B cells and T cells, which produce the immune response against foreign substances. White blood cells spend most of their time outside the circulatory system, patrolling through interstitial fluid and the lymphatic system, where most of the battles against pathogens are waged. Normally, a cubic millimeter of human blood has about 5,000 to 10,000 leukocytes, but their numbers increase temporarily whenever the body is fighting an infection.

The third cellular element of blood, platelets, are fragments of cells about 2 to 3 mm in diameter. They have no nuclei and originate as pinched-off cytoplasmic fragments of large cells in the bone marrow. Platelets then enter the blood and function in the important process of blood clotting.

Stem Cells and the Replacement of Cellular Elements

The cellular elements of blood (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) wear out and are replaced constantly throughout a person's life. Erythrocytes, for example, usually circulate for only about 3 to 4 months and then are destroyed by phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen. Enzymes digest the old cell's macromolecules, and biosynthetic processes construct new macromolecules using many of the monomers, such as amino acids, obtained from old blood cells, as well as new materials and energy from food. Many of the iron atoms derived from the hemoglobin in old red blood cells are built into new hemoglobin molecules.

Erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets all develop from a common source, a single population of cells called pluripotent stem cells in the red marrow of bones, particularly the ribs, vertebrae, breastbone, and pelvis (FIGURE 42.15, p. 884). "Pluripotent" means these cells have the potential to differentiate into any type of blood cell or into cells that produce platelets. Pluripotent stem cells arise in the early embryo, and the population renews itself while replenishing the blood with cellular elements. (See Chapter 21 for a more general discussion of stem cells.)

A negative-feedback mechanism, sensitive to the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues via the blood, controls erythrocyte production. If the tissues do not receive enough oxygen, the kidney converts a plasma protein to a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of erythrocytes. If blood is delivering more oxygen than the tissues can use, the level of erythropoietin is reduced, and erythrocyte production slows.

Recently, researchers have been able to isolate pluripotent stem cells and grow these cells in laboratory cultures. Purified pluripotent stem cells may soon provide an effective treatment for a number of human diseases, such as leukemia. A person with leukemia has a cancerous line of the stem cells that produce leukocytes. The cancerous stem cells crowd out cells that make red blood cells and produce an unusually high number of leukocytes, many of which are abnormal. One strategy now being used experimentally for treating leukemia is to remove pluripotent stem cells from a patient, destroy the bone marrow, and restock it with noncancerous pluripotent cells. As few as 30 of these cells can completely repopulate the bone marrow.

Blood Clotting

We all get cuts and scrapes from time to time, yet we do not bleed to death because blood contains a self-sealing material that plugs leaks. The sealant is always present in an inactive form called fibrinogen. A clot forms only when this plasma protein is converted to its active form, fibrin, which aggregates into threads that form the framework of the clot. The clotting mechanism usually begins with the release of clotting factors from platelets and involves a complex chain of reactions that ultimately transforms fibrinogen to fibrin (FIGURE 42.16). More than a dozen clotting factors have been discovered, and the mechanism is still not fully understood. An inherited defect in any step of the clotting process causes hemophilia, a disease characterized by excessive bleeding from even minor cuts and bruises.

Fig 42-16. Blood clotting.

Anticlotting factors in the blood normally prevent spontaneous clotting in the absence of injury. Sometimes, however, platelets clump and fibrin coagulates within a blood vessel, blocking the flow of blood. Such a clot is called a thrombus. These potentially dangerous clots are more likely to form in individuals with cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the heart and blood vessels.





 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States and most other developed nations

More than half the deaths in the United States are caused by cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the heart and blood vessels. The final blow is usually a heart attack or a stroke. A heart attack is the death of cardiac muscle tissue resulting from prolonged blockage of one or more coronary arteries, the vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart (the constantly beating heart muscle cannot survive long without oxygen). A stroke is the death of nervous tissue in the brain, usually resulting from rupture or blockage of arteries in the head. Heart attacks and strokes frequently result from a thrombus that clogs an artery. A thrombus may form in a coronary artery or an artery in the brain, or it may develop elsewhere in the circulatory system and reach the heart or brain via the bloodstream. Such a transported clot, called an embolus, is swept along until it becomes lodged in an artery too small for the clot to pass. This blocks blood flow, and cardiac or brain tissue downstream from the obstruction may die from oxygen deprivation. If damage in the heart interrupts the conduction of electrical impulses through cardiac muscle, heart rate may change drastically or the heart may stop beating altogether. Still, the victim may survive if heartbeat is restored by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or some other emergency procedure within a few minutes of the attack. The effects of a stroke and the individual's chance of survival depend on the extent and location of the damaged brain tissue.

The suddenness of a heart attack or stroke belies the fact that the arteries of most victims had become gradually impaired by a chronic cardiovascular disease known as atherosclerosis. During the course of this disease, growths called plaques develop on the inner walls of the arteries, narrowing their bore (FIGURE 42.17). A plaque forms at a site where the smooth muscle layer of an artery thickens abnormally and becomes infiltrated with fibrous connective tissue and lipids such as cholesterol. In some cases, plaques also become hardened by calcium deposits, resulting in a form of atherosclerosis called arteriosclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries. An embolus is more likely to become trapped in a vessel that has been narrowed by plaques. Furthermore, plaques are common sites of thrombus formation. Healthy arteries have smooth linings, but the rougher lining of an artery damaged by atherosclerosis seems to encourage the adhesion of platelets, which triggers the clotting process.

Fig 42-17. Atherosclerosis. These light micrographs contrast a cross section of (a) a normal artery with (b) an artery partially closed by an atherosclerotic plaque. Plaques consist mostly of fibrous connective tissue and smooth muscle cells infiltrated with lipids.

As atherosclerosis progresses, arteries become more and more clogged and the threat of heart attack or stroke becomes much greater. Sometimes there are warnings. For example, if a coronary artery is partially blocked by atherosclerosis, a person may feel occasional chest pains, a condition known as angina pectoris. The pain is a signal that part of the heart is not receiving a sufficient supply of oxygen, and it is most likely to occur when the heart is laboring hard because of physical or emotional stress. Unfortunately, many people with atherosclerosis are completely unaware of their disease until catastrophe strikes.

Hypertension (high blood pressure) promotes atherosclerosis and increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Atherosclerosis tends to increase blood pressure by narrowing the bore of the vessels and reducing their elasticity. According to one hypothesis, high blood pressure causes chronic damage to the endothelium that lines arteries, promoting plaque formation. Fortunately, hypertension is simple to diagnose and can usually be controlled by diet, exercise, medication, or a combination of these. A diastolic pressure above 90 may be cause for concern, and living with extreme hypertension--say, 200/120--is courting disaster.

To some extent, the tendency to develop hypertension and atherosclerosis is inherited. Nongenetic factors that have been correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease include smoking, lack of exercise, a diet rich in animal fat, and an abnormally high concentration of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol travels in the blood plasma mainly in the form of particles made up of thousands of cholesterol molecules and other lipids bound to a protein. One form of these particles called low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), the so-called "bad cholesterol," is associated with the depositing of cholesterol in arterial plaques. Another form, called high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), the so-called "good cholesterol," may reduce cholesterol deposition. Exercise tends to increase HDL concentration, while smoking has the opposite effect on the LDL-to-HDL ratio.





 Gas exchange supplies oxygen for cellular respiration and disposes of carbon dioxide: an overview

For the rest of this chapter we focus on gas exchange. This process is often called respiration, but it should not be confused with the energy transformations of cellular respiration. Gas exchange is the uptake of molecular oxygen (O2) from the environment and the discharge of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the environment (FIGURE 42.18). These exchanges are necessary to support the production of ATP in cellular respiration, and usually involve both the respiratory system and the circulatory system.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 42-18. The role of gas exchange in bioenergetics.

The source of oxygen, called the respiratory medium, is air for terrestrial animals and water for aquatic animals. The atmosphere is Earth's main reservoir of molecular oxygen and is about 21%  O2 (by volume). Oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water contain oxygen in dissolved form. The amount of O2 dissolved in a given volume of water varies considerably, but is always much less than is present in an equivalent volume of air.

The part of an animal where gases are exchanged with the environment is called the respiratory surface. Animals do not actively transport O2 and CO2 across membranes, so movement of these gases between the respiratory surface and the environment is entirely by diffusion. The rate of diffusion is proportional to the surface area across which diffusion occurs, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance through which molecules must move. Therefore, respiratory surfaces tend to be thin and have large areas, structural adaptations that maximize the rate of gas exchange. Moreover, all living cells must be bathed in water to maintain their plasma membranes. Thus, the respiratory surfaces of terrestrial as well as aquatic animals are moist, and O2 and CO2 diffuse across them after first dissolving in water.

The respiratory surface must supply O2 and expel CO2 for the entire body, and a variety of solutions to the problem of providing a large enough surface have evolved. The structure of a respiratory surface depends mainly on the size of the organism and whether it lives in water or on land, but is also influenced by metabolic demands for gas exchange. Thus, an endotherm has a larger area of respiratory surface than a similar-sized ectotherm.

Gas exchange occurs over the entire surface area of protists and other unicellular organisms. Similarly, for some relatively simple animals, such as sponges, cnidarians, and flatworms, the plasma membrane of every cell in the body is close enough to the outside environment for gases to diffuse in and out. In many animals, however, the bulk of the body does not have direct access to the respiratory medium, and the respiratory surface is a thin, moist epithelium separating the respiratory medium from the blood or capillaries, which transport gases to and from the rest of the body (see FIGURE 42.18).

Some animals use their entire outer skin as a respiratory organ. An earthworm, for example, has moist skin and exchanges gases by diffusion across its general body surface. Just below the skin is a dense net of capillaries. Because the respiratory surface must be moist, earthworms and many other skin-breathers, including some amphibians, must live in water or damp places.

Animals that use their moist skin as their only respiratory organ are usually small and are either long and thin or flat in shape, with a high ratio of surface area to volume. For most other animals, the general body surface lacks sufficient area to exchange gases for the whole body. The solution is a respiratory organ that is extensively folded or branched, thereby enlarging the available surface area for gas exchange. Gills, tracheae, and lungs are the three most common respiratory organs.





 Gills are respiratory adaptations of most aquatic animals

Gills are outfoldings of the body surface that are suspended in the water. In some invertebrates, such as sea stars, the gills have a simple shape and are distributed over much of the body (FIGURE 42.19a). Many segmented worms have flaplike gills that extend from each segment of the body, or long feathery gills clustered at the head or tail (FIGURE 42.19b). The gills of clams, crayfish, and many other animals are restricted to a local body region (FIGURES 42.19c and d). The total surface area of the gills is often much greater than that of the rest of the body.

Fig 42-19. Diversity in the structure of gills, external body surfaces functioning in gas exchange. (a) The gills of a sea star are simple tubular projections of the skin. The hollow core of each gill is an extension of the coelom (body cavity). Gas exchange occurs by diffusion across the gill surfaces, and fluid in the coelom circulates in and out of the gills, aiding gas transport. The surfaces of a sea star's tube feet also function in gas exchange. (b) Many polychaetes, marine worms of the phylum Annelida, have a pair of flattened appendages called parapodia on each body segment. The parapodia serve as gills and also function in crawling and swimming. (c) The gills of a clam are long, flattened plates projecting downward from the main body mass inside the hard shell. Cilia on the gills circulate water around the gill surfaces. (d) Crayfish and other crustaceans have long, feathery gills covered by the exoskeleton. Specialized body appendages drive water over the gill surfaces.

As a respiratory medium, water has both advantages and disadvantages. There is no problem keeping the cell membranes of the respiratory surface moist, since the gills are surrounded by the aqueous environment. However, O2 concentrations in water are low; and the warmer and saltier the water, the less dissolved oxygen it can hold (water in many marine and freshwater habitats contains only 4-8 mL of dissolved O2 per liter). Thus, gills must be very effective to obtain enough oxygen. One process that helps is ventilation, which increases the flow of the respiratory medium over the respiratory surface. Without ventilation, a region of low O2 and high CO2 concentrations can form around the gill as it exchanges gas with the water. Crayfish and lobsters have paddlelike appendages that drive a current of water over the gills. Fish gills are ventilated by a current of water that enters the mouth, passes through slits in the pharynx, flows over the gills, and then exits the body (FIGURE 42.20). Because water is dense and contains little oxygen per unit of volume, most fish must expend considerable energy in ventilating their gills.

Fig 42-20. The structure and function of fish gills. Fish continuously pump water through the mouth and over the gill arches, using coordinated movements of the jaws and operculum (gill cover) for this ventilation. (Swimming fish can simply open their mouths and let water flow past the gills.) Each gill arch has two rows of gill filaments, composed of flattened plates called lamellae. Blood flowing through capillaries within the lamellae picks up oxygen from the water. Notice that water flows over the lamellae in a direction opposite to the blood flow, an arrangement called a countercurrent, which enhances oxygen transfer (see FIGURE 42.21).

The arrangement of capillaries in a fish gill enhances gas exchange and reduces the energy cost of ventilation. Blood flows in the opposite direction to the movement of water past the gills. This makes it possible for oxygen to be transferred to the blood by a very efficient process called countercurrent exchange (FIGURES 42.20 and 42.21). As blood moves through a gill capillary, it becomes more and more loaded with oxygen, but it simultaneously encounters water with ever higher oxygen concentrations because the water is just beginning its passage over the gills. This means that along the entire length of the capillary, there is a diffusion gradient favoring the transfer of oxygen from water to blood. The countercurrent exchange mechanism is so efficient that the gills can remove more than 80%  of the oxygen dissolved in the water passing over the respiratory surface. The basic mechanism of countercurrent exchange is also important in temperature regulation and several other physiological processes, as we will see in Chapter 44.

The countercurrent flow of water and blood maintains a concentration gradient down which O2 diffuses from the water into the blood over the whole length of a capillary. As the blood flows through a lamellar capillary, it becomes more and more loaded with oxygen because it continuously passes by water that is more and more concentrated in O2.

Gills are generally unsuitable for an animal living on land. An expansive surface of wet membrane exposed to air would lose too much water by evaporation, and the gills would collapse as their fine filaments, no longer supported by water, would cling together. Most terrestrial animals have their respiratory surfaces within the body, opening to the atmosphere through narrow tubes.





 Tracheal systems and lungs are respiratory adaptations of terrestrial animals

As a respiratory medium, air has many advantages over water, including a much higher concentration of oxygen (about 210 mL O2 per liter of air). Also, since O2 and CO2 diffuse much faster in air than in water, respiratory surfaces exposed to air do not have to be ventilated as thoroughly as gills. As the respiratory surface removes O2 from the air and expels CO2, diffusion rapidly brings more oxygen to the respiratory surface and carries the CO2 away. When a terrestrial animal does ventilate, less energy is needed because air is far lighter and much easier to pump than water and because much less volume needs to be breathed to obtain an equal amount of O2. But along with these advantages comes a problem: The respiratory surface, which must be large and moist, continuously loses water to the air by evaporation. The problem is greatly reduced by a respiratory surface folded into the body.

Tracheal Systems

The tracheal system of insects, made up of air tubes that branch throughout the body, is one variation on the theme of a folded internal respiratory surface. The largest tubes, called tracheae, open to the outside. The finest branches extend to the surface of nearly every cell, where gas is exchanged by diffusion across the moist epithelium that lines the terminal ends of the tracheal system (FIGURE 42.22). With virtually all body cells within a very short distance of the respiratory medium, the open circulatory system of insects is not involved in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Fig 42-22. Tracheal systems. (a) The respiratory system of an insect consists of branched internal tubes that deliver air directly to body cells. Rings of chitin reinforce the largest tubes, called tracheae, keeping them from collapsing. Enlarged portions of tracheae form air sacs near organs that require a large supply of oxygen. Air enters the tracheae through openings called spiracles on the insect's body surface and passes into smaller tubes called tracheoles. The tracheoles terminate on the plasma membranes of individual cells. The tiny tips of the tracheoles are closed and contain fluid (dark blue). When the animal is active and is using more O2, most of the fluid is withdrawn into the body. This increases the surface area of air in contact with cells. (b) This micrograph shows cross sections of tracheoles in a tiny piece of insect flight muscle (TEM). Each of the numerous mitochondria in the muscle cells lies within about 5 mm of one or more tracheoles.

For a small insect, diffusion through the trachea brings in enough O2 and removes enough CO2 to support cellular respiration. Larger insects with higher energy demands ventilate their tracheal systems with rhythmic body movements that compress and expand the air tubes like bellows. An insect in flight has a very high metabolic rate, consuming 10 to 200 times more O2 than it does at rest. In many flying insects, alternating contraction and relaxation of the flight muscles compress and expand the body, rapidly pumping air through the tracheal system. The flight muscle cells are packed with mitochondria that support the high metabolic rate, and the tracheal tubes supply each of these ATP-generating organelles with ample oxygen (FIGURE 42.22b). Thus, we see a direct relationship between adaptations of tracheal systems and the theme of bioenergetics.

Lungs

Unlike tracheal systems that branch throughout the insect body, lungs are restricted to one location. Because the respiratory surface of a lung is not in direct contact with all other parts of the body, the gap must be bridged by the circulatory system, which transports gases between the lungs and the rest of the body. Lungs have a dense net of capillaries just under the epithelium that forms the respiratory surface. Lungs have evolved in spiders, terrestrial snails, and vertebrates.

Among the vertebrates, amphibians have relatively small lungs that do not provide a large surface (many lack lungs altogether), and rely heavily on diffusion across other body surfaces for gas exchange. The skin of frogs, for example, supplements gas exchange in the lungs. In contrast, most reptiles and all birds and mammals rely entirely on lungs for gas exchange. Turtles are an exception; they supplement lung breathing with gas exchange across moist epithelial surfaces in their mouth and anus. Lungs and air-breathing have evolved in a few fish species (lungfishes) as adaptations to living in oxygen-poor water or to spending part of their time exposed to air (for example, when the water level of a pond recedes).

In general, the size and complexity of lungs are correlated with an animal's metabolic rate (and hence rate of gas exchange). For example, the lungs of endotherms have a greater area of exchange surface than the lungs of similar-sized ectotherms.

Mammalian Respiratory Systems: A Closer Look

Located in the thoracic (chest) cavity, the lungs of mammals have a spongy texture and are honeycombed with a moist epithelium that functions as the respiratory surface. A system of branching ducts conveys air to the lungs (FIGURE 42.23). Air enters through the nostrils and is then filtered by hairs, warmed, humidified, and sampled for odors as it flows through a maze of spaces in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity leads to the pharynx, an intersection where the paths for air and food cross. When food is swallowed, the larynx (the upper part of the respiratory tract) moves upward and tips the epiglottis over the glottis (the opening of the windpipe). This allows food to go down the esophagus to the stomach (see FIGURE 41.14). The rest of the time, the glottis is open, and we can breathe.

Fig 42-23. The mammalian respiratory system. (a) From the nasal cavity and pharynx, inhaled air passes through the larynx and down the trachea and bronchi to the tiniest bronchioles, which end in lobed, microscopic air sacs called alveoli. (b) A thin, moist epithelium lining the inner surfaces of the alveoli is the respiratory surface. Branches of the pulmonary artery (see FIGURE 42.4) convey oxygen-poor blood to the alveoli, while branches of the pulmonary vein transport oxygen-rich blood from the alveoli back to the heart. (c) The left micrograph (SEM) shows the dense capillary bed that envelops the alveoli. The right micrograph (colorized SEM) is a cutaway view of alveoli, showing the air spaces.

The wall of the larynx is reinforced with cartilage. In most mammals, the larynx is adapted as a voicebox. When air is exhaled, it rushes by a pair of vocal cords in the larynx, and sounds are produced when voluntary muscles in the voicebox are tensed, stretching the cords so they vibrate. High-pitched sounds result when the cords are stretched tight and vibrate rapidly; low-pitched sounds come from less tense cords vibrating slowly.

From the larynx, air passes into the trachea, or windpipe. Rings of cartilage (actually shaped like the letter C) maintain the shape of the trachea. The trachea forks into two bronchi (singular, bronchus), one leading to each lung. Within the lung, the bronchus branches repeatedly into finer and finer tubes called bronchioles. The entire system of air ducts has the appearance of an inverted tree, the trunk being the trachea. The epithelium lining the major branches of this respiratory tree is covered by cilia and a thin film of mucus. The mucus traps dust, pollen, and other particulate contaminants, and the beating cilia move the mucus upward to the pharynx, where it can be swallowed into the esophagus. This process helps cleanse the respiratory system.

At their tips, the tiniest bronchioles dead-end as a cluster of air sacs called alveoli (singular, alveolus; FIGURE 42.23b). Gas exchange occurs across the thin epithelium of the lung's millions of alveoli, which have a total surface area of about 100 m2 in humans, sufficient to carry out gas exchange for the entire body. Oxygen in the air entering the alveoli dissolves in the moist film and rapidly diffuses across the epithelium into a web of capillaries that surrounds each alveolus. Carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction, from the capillaries across the epithelium of the alveolus, and into the air space (FIGURE 42.23c).

Ventilating the Lungs

Like fish, terrestrial vertebrates rely on ventilation to maintain high oxygen and low carbon dioxide concentrations at the gas exchange surface. The process that ventilates lungs is breathing, the alternate inhalation and exhalation of air.

A frog ventilates its lungs by positive pressure breathing. During a breathing cycle, muscles lower the floor of the oral cavity, enlarging it and drawing in air through the nostrils. Then, with the nostrils and mouth closed, the floor of the oral cavity rises and air is forced down the trachea. Elastic recoil of the lungs, together with compression by the muscular body wall, forces air back out of the lungs during exhalation.

In contrast to how a frog breathes, mammals ventilate their lungs by negative pressure breathing, which works like a suction pump, pulling air instead of pushing it into the lungs (FIGURE 42.24). Muscle action changes the volume of the rib cage and the chest cavity, and the lungs follow suit. This occurs because the lungs are enclosed by a double-walled sac. The inner layer of the sac adheres to the outside of the lungs, and the outer layer adheres to the wall of the chest cavity. A thin space filled with fluid separates the two layers. Because of surface tension, the two layers behave like two plates of glass stuck together by a film of water. The layers can slide smoothly past each other, but they cannot be pulled apart easily. Surface tension couples movement of the lungs to movement of the rib cage.

Fig 42-24. Negative pressure breathing. A mammal breathes by changing the air pressure within its lungs relative to the pressure of the outside atmosphere. During inhalation, the rib muscles and diaphragm contract. The volume of the thoracic cavity and lungs increases as the diaphragm moves down and the rib cage expands. Air pressure in the lungs falls below that of the atmosphere, and air rushes into the lungs. Exhalation occurs when the rib muscles and diaphragm relax, restoring the thoracic cavity to its smaller volume.

Lung volume increases as a result of contraction of the rib muscles and the diaphragm, a sheet of skeletal muscle that forms the bottom wall of the chest cavity. Contraction of the rib muscles expands the rib cage by pulling the ribs upward and the breastbone outward. At the same time, the chest cavity expands as the diaphragm contracts and descends like a piston. All these changes increase the lung volume, and as a result, air pressure within the alveoli becomes lower than atmospheric pressure. Because gas flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure, air rushes through the nostrils and down the breathing tubes to the alveoli. During exhalation, the rib muscles and diaphragm relax, lung volume is reduced, and the increase in air pressure within the alveoli forces air up the breathing tubes and out through the nostrils (see FIGURE 42.24).

Actions of the rib muscles and diaphragm accounts for changes in lung volume during shallow breathing, when a mammal is at rest. During vigorous exercise, other muscles of the neck, back, and chest further increase ventilation volume by raising the rib cage even more. In some species, the rhythmic movements during running cause visceral organs, including the stomach and liver, to slide forward and backward in the body cavity with each stride. This "visceral pump" further increases ventilation volume by adding to the piston-like action of the diaphragm.

The volume of air an animal inhales and exhales with each breath is called tidal volume. It averages about 500 mL in resting humans. The maximum tidal volume during forced breathing is the vital capacity, which is about 3.4 L and 4.8 L for college-age females and males, respectively. The lungs hold more air than the vital capacity, but since it is impossible to completely collapse the alveoli, a residual volume of air remains in the lungs even after we forcefully exhale as much as we can. As lungs lose their resilience as a result of aging or disease (such as emphysema), residual volume increases at the expense of vital capacity. Since the lungs do not completely empty and refill with each breath cycle, newly inhaled air is mixed with oxygen-depleted residual air, and the maximum oxygen concentration in alveoli is considerably less than in the atmosphere. This limits the effectiveness of gas exchange.

Ventilation is much more complex in birds than in mammals. Besides lungs, birds have eight or nine air sacs that penetrate the abdomen, neck, and even the wings. The air sacs do not function directly in gas exchange, but act as bellows that keep air flowing through the lungs (FIGURE 42.25). They may also reduce the density of the bird, an adaptation for flight (see Chapter 34). The entire system--lungs and air sacs--is ventilated when the bird breathes. Air flows through the interconnected system in a circuit that passes through the lungs in one direction only, regardless of whether the bird is inhaling or exhaling. Instead of alveoli, which are dead ends, the sites of gas exchange in bird lungs are tiny channels called parabronchi, through which air flows in one direction.

Fig 42-25. The avian respiratory system. Contraction and relaxation of the air sacs ventilates the lungs, forcing air in one direction (magenta arrows) through tiny parallel tubes in the lungs called parabronchi (inset, SEM). Gas exchange occurs across the walls of the parabronchi. During inhalation, both sets of air sacs expand. The posterior sacs fill with fresh air (blue) from the outside, while the anterior sacs fill with stale air (gray) from the lungs. During exhalation, both sets of air sacs deflate, forcing air from the posterior sacs into the lungs, and air from the anterior sacs out of the system via the trachea. Two cycles of inhalation and exhalation are required for the air to pass all the way through the system and out of the bird.

This system completely exchanges the air in the lungs with every breath, so maximum lung oxygen concentrations are higher in birds than in mammals. Partly because of this advantage, birds perform much better than mammals at high altitude. For example, human mountaineers experience tremendous difficulty obtaining enough oxygen when climbing the Earth's highest peaks, such as Mt. Everest in the Himalayas (8,848 m)--but several species of birds (notably the bar-headed goose) easily fly over the same mountains at altitudes of 9,000 m or more during migration.





 Control centers in the brain regulate the rate and depth of breathing

We can hold our breath voluntarily for a short while or consciously breathe faster and deeper, but most of the time automatic mechanisms regulate our breathing. This ensures that the work of the respiratory system is coordinated with that of the cardiovascular system, and with the body's metabolic demands for gas exchange.

Our breathing control centers are located in two regions of the brain, the medulla oblongata and the pons (FIGURE 42.26). Aided by the control center in the pons, the medulla's center sets the basic breathing rhythm. When we take deep breaths, a negative-feedback mechanism prevents our lungs from overexpanding; stretch sensors in the lung tissue send nerve impulses back to the medulla, inhibiting its breathing control center.

Fig 42-26. Automatic control of breathing.

The medulla's control center monitors the CO2 level of the blood and regulates breathing activity appropriately. Its main cues about CO2 concentration come from slight changes in the pH of the blood and tissue fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) bathing the brain. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which lowers the pH. When the medulla's control center registers a slight drop in pH (increase in CO2) of the cerebrospinal fluid or blood, it increases the depth and rate of breathing, and the excess CO2 is eliminated in exhaled air. This occurs when we exercise.

Oxygen concentrations in the blood usually have little effect on the breathing control centers. However, when the O2 level is severely depressed--at high altitudes, for instance, O2 sensors in the aorta and carotid arteries in the neck send alarm signals to the breathing control centers, which respond by increasing the breathing rate. Normally, a rise in CO2 concentration is a good indication of a fall in O2 concentration, because CO2 is produced by the same process that consumes O2--cellular respiration. However, it is possible to trick the breathing center by hyperventilating. Excessively deep, rapid breathing purges the blood of so much CO2 that the breathing center temporarily ceases to send impulses to the rib muscles and diaphragm. Breathing stops until CO2 levels increase (or O2 levels decrease) enough to switch the breathing center back on.

The breathing center responds to a variety of nervous and chemical signals and adjusts the rate and depth of breathing to meet the changing demands of the body. However, breathing control is only effective if it is coordinated with control of the circulatory system, so that there is a good match between lung ventilation and the amount of blood flowing through alveolar capillaries. During exercise, for instance, increased cardiac output is matched to the increased breathing rate, which enhances O2 uptake and CO2 removal as blood flows through the lungs.





 Gases diffuse down pressure gradients in the lungs and other organs

For a gas, whether present in air or dissolved in water, diffusion depends on differences in a quantity called partial pressure. At sea level, the atmosphere exerts a total pressure of 760 mm Hg. This is a downward force equal to that exerted by a column of mercury 760 mm high. Since the atmosphere is 21%  oxygen (by volume), the partial pressure of oxygen (abbreviated PO2) is 0.21 &#160;X&#160; 760, or about 160 mm Hg. This is the portion of atmospheric pressure contributed by oxygen; hence the term partial pressure. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) at sea level is only 0.23 mm Hg. When water is exposed to air, the amount of a gas that dissolves in the water is proportional to its partial pressure in the air and its solubility in water. An equilibrium is eventually reached when gas molecules enter and leave the solution at the same rate. At this point, the gas is said to have the same partial pressure in solution as it does in the air. Thus, in a glass of water exposed to air at sea-level air pressure, the PO2 is 160 mm Hg, and the PCO2 is 0.23 mm Hg.

A gas will always diffuse from a region of higher partial pressure. Blood arriving at the lungs via the pulmonary arteries has a lower PO2 and a higher PCO2 than the air in the alveoli (FIGURE 42.27). As blood enters the alveolar capillaries, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood to the air within the alveoli. Meanwhile, oxygen in the air dissolves in the fluid that coats the epithelium and diffuses across the surface and into the blood. By the time the blood leaves the lungs in the pulmonary veins, its PO2 has been raised and its PCO2 has been lowered. After returning to the heart, this blood is pumped through the systemic circuit. In the tissue capillaries, gradients of partial pressure favor the diffusion of oxygen out of the blood and carbon dioxide into the blood. This is because cellular respiration removes oxygen from and adds carbon dioxide to the interstitial fluid (again, by diffusion, from mitochondria in nearby cells). After the blood unloads oxygen and loads carbon dioxide, it is returned to the heart and pumped to the lungs again, where it exchanges gases with air in the alveoli.

 Respiratory pigments transport gases and help buffer the blood

Oxygen Transport

The low solubility of oxygen in water is a fundamental problem for animals that rely on the circulatory system for oxygen delivery. Consider the situation a human would face if all oxygen had to be delivered in solution in the blood. During intense exercise a person can consume almost 2 L of oxygen per minute, and all of it must be carried in the circulation from the lungs to the active tissues. At normal body temperature and air pressure, only 4.5 mL of O2 can dissolve into a liter of blood in the lungs. If 80%  of the dissolved oxygen were delivered to the tissues (an unrealistically high percentage), the heart would need to pump 500 L of blood per minute--a ton every 2 minutes! That level of cardiac output is clearly unrealistic. In fact, most animals transport most of their oxygen bound to special proteins called respiratory pigments instead of dissolved in solution. Respiratory pigments circulate with the blood, often contained within specialized cells. The pigments greatly increase the amount of oxygen that can be carried in blood (to about 200 mL of O2 per liter in mammalian blood), and therefore greatly reduce the cardiac output necessary for oxygen transport to a manageable 20-25 L of blood per minute in our example of an exercising human.

Most animals would be unable to support their normal energy metabolism without respiratory pigments, and a diversity of these proteins have evolved in various animal taxa. One example, hemocyanin, found in the hemolymph of arthropods and many mollusks, has copper as its oxygen-binding component, coloring the blood bluish. The respiratory pigment of almost all vertebrates is the protein hemoglobin, contained in red blood cells. Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each with a cofactor called a heme group that has an iron atom at its center. It is the iron that actually binds O2; thus, each hemoglobin molecule can carry four molecules of O2 (see FIGURE 5.23b). Like all respiratory pigments, hemoglobin must bind oxygen reversibly, loading oxygen in the lungs or gills and unloading it in other parts of the body. Loading and unloading depends on cooperation among the subunits of the hemoglobin molecule. (See Chapter 6 to review the concept of cooperativity in allosteric proteins.) The binding of oxygen to one subunit induces the remaining subunits to change their shape slightly so that their affinity for oxygen increases. And when one subunit unloads its oxygen, the other three quickly follow suit as a conformational change lowers their affinity for oxygen.

Cooperative oxygen binding and release is evident in the dissociation curve for hemoglobin (FIGURE 42.28). Over the range of oxygen partial pressures (PO2) where the dissociation curve has a steep slope, even a slight change in PO2 causes hemoglobin to load or unload a substantial amount of oxygen. Notice that the steep part of the curve corresponds to the range of oxygen partial pressures found in body tissues. When cells in a particular location begin working harder--during exercise, for instance--PO2 dips in their vicinity as the O2 is consumed in cellular respiration. Because of the effect of subunit cooperativity, a slight drop in PO2 is enough to cause a relatively large increase in the amount of oxygen the blood unloads.

Fig 42-28. Oxygen dissociation curves for hemoglobin.

As with all proteins, hemoglobin's conformation is sensitive to a variety of factors. For example, a drop in pH lowers the affinity of hemoglobin for O2, an effect called the Bohr shift (FIGURE 42.28b). Because CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an active tissue will lower the pH of its surroundings and induce hemoglobin to release more oxygen, which can be used for cellular respiration.

Carbon Dioxide Transport

In addition to its role in oxygen transport, hemoglobin also helps transport carbon dioxide (FIGURE 42.29, p. 896) and assists in buffering--that is, preventing harmful changes in blood pH. Only about 7%  of the CO2 released by respiring cells is transported in solution in blood plasma. Another 23%  binds to the multiple amino groups of hemoglobin, and about 70%  is transported in the blood in the form of bicarbonate ions. Carbon dioxide from respiring cells diffuses into the blood plasma and then into the red blood cells, where it is converted to bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide first reacts with water (assisted by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase) to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into a hydrogen ion and a bicarbonate ion. Most of the hydrogen ions attach to various sites on hemoglobin and other proteins and therefore do not change the pH of blood. The bicarbonate ions diffuse into the plasma. As blood flows through the lungs, the process is rapidly reversed as diffusion of CO2 out of the blood shifts the chemical equilibrium in favor of the conversion of bicarbonate to CO2.

 Deep-diving air-breathers stockpile oxygen and deplete it slowly

The majority of animals can exchange gases continuously, but sometimes there is no access to the normal respiratory medium--for example, when an air-breather swims underwater. Most humans, even well-trained divers, can only hold their breath for 2 or 3 minutes and swim to depths of 20 m or so, but the Weddell seal shown in FIGURE 42.30 routinely plunges to 200-500 m and remains there for about 20 minutes (sometimes for more than an hour). Large penguins can dive to similar depths, and some species of seals, sea turtles, and whales make even more impressive dives. Elephant seals can reach depths of 1,500 m--almost a mile--and stay submerged for as much as two hours! One elephant seal carrying a recording device spent 40 days at sea diving almost continuously, with no surface period longer than 6 minutes. What physiological adaptations allow these air-breathers to perform so well underwater?

Fig 42-30. The Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddelli, a deep-diving mammal. Adaptations of the circulatory and respiratory systems enable this Antarctic seal to travel underwater for more than an hour.

One adaptation of the Weddell seal (and other divers) is an ability to store large amounts of oxygen. Compared to humans, the seal can store about twice as much oxygen per kilogram of body weight, mostly in the blood and muscles. About 36%  of our total oxygen is in our lungs, and 51%  is in our blood. In contrast, the Weddell seal holds only about 5%  of its oxygen in its relatively small lungs (and may exhale before diving to reduce buoyancy), stockpiling 70%  in the blood. The seal has about twice the volume of blood per kilogram of body weight as a human. Another adaptation is the seal's huge spleen, which can store about 24 L of blood. The spleen probably contracts after a dive begins, fortifying the blood with red blood cells loaded with oxygen. Diving mammals also have a high concentration of an oxygen-storing protein called myoglobin in their muscles. The Weddell seal can store about 25%  of its oxygen in muscle, compared to only 13%  in humans.

Diving vertebrates not only begin an underwater trip with a relatively large O2 stockpile, they also have adaptations that conserve oxygen. They swim with little muscular effort and often use buoyancy changes to glide passively upward or downward. Their heart rate and O2 consumption rate decrease during a dive, and regulatory mechanisms affecting peripheral resistance route most blood to the brain, spinal cord, eyes, adrenal glands, and placenta (in pregnant seals). Blood supply to the muscles is restricted, and is shut off altogether during the longest dives. During dives of more than about 20 minutes, a Weddell seal's muscles deplete the oxygen stored in myoglobin and then derive their ATP from fermentation instead of respiration (see Chapter 9).

The unusual abilities of the Weddell seal and other air-breathing divers to power their bodies during long dives showcase a central theme in our study of organisms--the response to environmental pressures over the short term by physiological adjustments and over the long term by natural selection.

We have seen throughout this chapter that the circulatory and respiratory systems cooperate extensively. The main function of the respiratory system--to supply O2 and dispose of CO2 in support of cellular bioenergetics--depends on the transport work of the circulatory system. Still another activity of the body that depends on the circulatory system is defense against disease, which we will examine in the next chapter.

An animal must defend itself against unwelcome intruders, the many potentially dangerous viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens it encounters in the air, in food, and in water. It must also deal with abnormal body cells, which, in some cases, may develop into cancer. Three cooperative lines of defense that counter these threats have evolved (FIGURE 43.1). Two of these are nonspecific--that is, they do not distinguish one infectious agent from another. The first line of nonspecific defense is external, consisting of epithelial tissues that cover and line our bodies (skin and mucous membranes) and the secretions they produce. The second line of nonspecific defense is internal: It is triggered by chemical signals and involves phagocytic cells and antimicrobial proteins that indiscriminately attack invaders that penetrate the body's outer barriers. The appearance of inflammation is a sign that this second line of defense has been deployed.

Fig 43-1. An overview of the body's defenses.

The third line of defense is the immune system. The immune system comes into play simultaneously with the second line of defense, but it responds in a specific way to particular microorganisms, aberrant body cells, toxins, and other substances marked by foreign molecules. The body's three lines of defense are somewhat analogous to the defenses of a besieged city: first the city walls, then ordinary soldiers, and finally intelligence officers who identify and track down specific dangerous infiltrators. The immune response, which includes the production of specific defensive proteins called antibodies, involves a diverse group of white blood cells called lymphocytes (seeFIGURES 42.14andFIGURES 42.15). The photograph on this page (a colorized SEM) shows specialized lymphocytes (light green) attacking a cancer cell (brown). This chapter examines how an animal's nonspecific and specific defenses work together to protect the body. Our main focus is on the defense mechanisms of vertebrates, which have a highly developed immune system.





NONSPECIFIC DEFENSES AGAINST INFECTION

 

 The skin and mucous membranes provide first-line barriers to infection



 

 Phagocytic cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins function early in infection



An invading microbe must penetrate the external barrier formed by the skin and mucous membranes, which cover the surface and line the openings of an animal's body. If it succeeds in doing so, the pathogen encounters the second line of nonspecific defense, interacting mechanisms that include phagocytosis, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins.





HOW SPECIFIC IMMUNITY ARISES

 

 Lymphocytes provide the specificity and diversity of the immune system



 

 Antigens interact with specific lymphocytes, inducing immune responses and immunological memory



 

 Lymphocyte development gives rise to an immune system that distinguishes self from nonself



While microorganisms are under assault by phagocytic cells, the inflammatory response, and antimicrobial proteins, they inevitably encounter lymphocytes, the key cells of the immune system--the body's third line of defense. Lymphocytes respond to such contacts by generating efficient and selective immune responses that work throughout the body to eliminate the particular invaders. Keep in mind that the cells of the immune system respond similarly to transplanted cells and even cancer cells, which they detect as foreign.





IMMUNE RESPONSES

 

 Helper T lymphocytes function in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity:



 

 In the cell-mediated response, cytotoxic T cells counter intracellular pathogens:



 

 In the humoral response, B cells make antibodies against extracellular pathogens:



 

 Invertebrates have a rudimentary immune system



The immune system can mount two types of responses to antigens: a humoral response and a cell-mediated response. Humoral immunity involves B cell activation and results from the production of antibodies that circulate in the blood plasma and lymph, fluids that were long ago called humors. Around the end of the nineteenth century, researchers performed an experiment in which they transferred such fluids from animals that had recovered from an infection to others that had not been exposed to it. For a short time the latter animals were protected from the infection. The investigators had transferred humoral immunity (antibodies) from animal to animal. They also found that immunity to some infections could be passed along only if cells, later identified as T lymphocytes, were transferred. This second type of immunity, which depends on the action of T cells, became known as cell-mediated immunity.

The circulating antibodies of the humoral response defend mainly against free bacteria, toxins, and viruses present in body fluids. In contrast, the T cells of the cell-mediated response are active against viruses and bacteria within infected body cells and against fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Cell-mediated immunity is crucial in the body's response against transplanted tissue and cancer cells, both of which are perceived as "nonself."FIGURE 43.10 provides an overview of the humoral and cell-mediated responses, the two branches of the immune system, which we will explore shortly. In addition to introducing these two branches, the figure shows the connections linking them--cell-signaling interactions among the lymphocytes. Central to this network of cell-signaling is the helper T cell, which responds to antigen presented by a macrophage and stimulates both B cells and other T cells.

As we continue to learn more about the vertebrate immune system, we expand our understanding of the body's battles against infections and cancer, its establishment of long-term immunity, and its reaction to blood transfusions and tissue transplants. We also gain insight into the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of numerous diseases, including disorders of the immune system itself.





 The skin and mucous membranes provide first-line barriers to infection

Intact skin is a barrier that cannot normally be penetrated by bacteria or viruses, although even minute abrasions may allow their passage. Likewise, the mucous membranes that line the digestive, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts bar the entry of potentially harmful microbes (see FIGURE 40.1). Beyond their role as a physical barrier, the skin and mucous membranes counter pathogens with chemical defenses. In humans, for example, secretions from sebaceous and sweat glands give the skin a pH ranging from 3 to 5, which is acidic enough to prevent colonization by many microbes. (Bacteria that make up the skin's normal flora are adapted to its acidic, relatively dry environment.) Microbial colonization is also inhibited by the washing action of saliva, tears, and mucous secretions that continually bathe the surfaces of exposed epithelia. In addition, all these secretions contain antimicrobial proteins. One of these protective proteins is the enzyme lysozyme (see FIGURE 5.17), which digests the cell walls of many bacteria and thus destroys many bacteria entering the upper respiratory tract and the openings around the eyes.

Mucus, the viscous fluid secreted by cells of mucous membranes, also traps microbes and other particles that contact it. In the trachea, ciliated epithelial cells sweep out mucus with its trapped microbes, preventing them from entering the lungs (FIGURE 43.2). Microbes present in food or water, or those in swallowed mucus, must contend with the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The acid destroys many microbes before they can enter the intestinal tract. There are exceptions, however: Hepatitis A virus, for example, is one of many pathogens that survives gastric acidity and gains access to the body via the digestive tract.

Fig 43-2. First-line respiratory defenses. In the lining of the trachea, shown here, specialized cells (orange) produce mucus that traps microbes before the invaders can enter the lungs. The mucous membrane is also equipped with ciliated cells (yellow). Synchronized beating of the cilia expels mucus and the trapped microbes upward into the pharynx (colorized SEM).





 Phagocytic cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins function early in infection

Microbes that penetrate the first line of defense, such as those that enter through a break in the skin, face the second line of defense. The body's internal mechanisms of nonspecific defense depend mainly on phagocytosis, the ingestion of invading organisms by certain types of white cells (see FIGURES 8.19a and 42.15). As you will see, phagocyte function is intimately associated with an effective inflammatory response and also with certain antimicrobial proteins. These nonspecific mechanisms help limit the spread of microbes in advance of specific immune response.

Phagocytic and Natural Killer Cells

The phagocytic cells called neutrophils constitute about 60% -70%  of all white blood cells (leukocytes). Cells damaged by invading microbes release chemical signals that attract neutrophils from the blood. The neutrophils enter the infected tissue, engulfing and destroying microbes there. (This migration toward the source of a chemical attractant is called chemotaxis.) However, neutrophils tend to self-destruct as they destroy foreign invaders, and their average life span is only a few days.

Monocytes, although they constitute only about 5%  of leukocytes, provide an even more effective phagocytic defense. New monocytes circulate in the blood for only a few hours, then migrate into tissues, developing into large macrophages ("big eaters"). Macrophages, the largest phagocytic cells, are especially effective, long-lived phagocytes. These cells extend long pseudopodia that can attach to polysaccharides on a microbe's surface (FIGURE 43.3). A macrophage engulfs a microbe in a vacuole that fuses with a lysosome (like the "food vacuole" in FIGURE 7.14). The lysosome has two ways of killing the trapped microbe. First, it can generate toxic forms of oxygen. Two of these toxic molecules, superoxide anion and nitric oxide, are now thought to be the main antimicrobial agents within phagocytes. Second, lysosomal enzymes, including lysozyme, digest microbial components. Interestingly, some microbes have evolved mechanisms for evading phagocytic destruction. Some bacteria have outer capsules to which a macrophage cannot attach. Others, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are readily engulfed but are resistant to lysosomal destruction and can even reproduce inside a macrophage. These microorganisms are a particular problem for both nonspecific and specific defenses of the body.

Fig 43-3. Phagocytosis by a macrophage. This micrograph shows fibril-like pseudopodia of a macrophage attaching to rod-shaped bacteria, which will be ingested and destroyed (colorized SEM).

Some macrophages migrate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in certain tissues: in lung (alveolar macrophages), liver (Kupffer's cells), kidney (mesangial cells), brain (microglial cells), connective tissues (histiocytes), and especially in lymph nodes and the spleen, key organs of the lymphatic system (FIGURE 43.4). The fixed macrophages in the spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues are particularly well located to contact infectious agents. Microorganisms, microbial fragments, and foreign molecules that enter the blood encounter macrophages as they become trapped in the netlike architecture of the spleen, while those in tissue fluid flow into lymph and are filtered through the lymph nodes.

About 1.5%  of all leukocytes are eosinophils. Their main contribution to defense is against larger parasitic invaders, such as the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni (see FIGURE 33.10). Eosinophils position themselves against the external wall of a parasite and discharge destructive enzymes from cytoplasmic granules. These cells have only limited phagocytic activity.

Nonspecific defense also includes natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells do not attack microorganisms directly; instead, they destroy virus-infected body cells (as well as abnormal body cells that could become cancerous). NK cells are not phagocytic; rather, they mount an attack on the cell's membrane, causing the cell to lyse (burst open).

The Inflammatory Response

Damage to tissue by a physical injury (such as a cut) or by the entry of microorganisms triggers a localized inflammatory response (FIGURE 43.5). In the injured area, precapillary arterioles dilate and postcapillary venules constrict, increasing the local blood supply (see FIGURE 42.7). These events are responsible for the characteristic redness and heat of inflammation (L. inflammo, "to set on fire"). The blood-engorged capillaries leak fluid into neighboring tissues, causing the edema (swelling) also associated with inflammation.

Fig 43-5. A simplified view of the inflammatory response.

The inflammatory response is initiated by chemical signals. Some of these signals arise from the invading organism itself. Others, such as histamine, are released by cells of the body in response to tissue injury. Histamine is produced by circulating leukocytes called basophils and by mast cells found in connective tissue. When injured, these cells release histamine, triggering both dilation and increased permeability of nearby capillaries. Leukocytes and damaged tissue cells also discharge prostaglandins (see discussion of local regulators in Chapter 45) and other substances that further promote blood flow to the site of injury. Enhanced blood flow and vessel permeability aid in delivering clotting elements to the injured area. Blood clotting marks the beginning of the repair process and helps block the spread of microbes to other parts of the body (see FIGURE 42.16).

Increased local blood flow and capillary permeability also enhance the migration of phagocytic cells from the blood into the injured tissues. Probably the most important element of inflammation--indeed, of nonspecific defense--is phagocytosis. Phagocyte migration to the damage site usually begins within an hour after injury. Chemotactic factors released from invading bacteria and injured tissues attract phagocytes. In addition, molecules called chemokines, secreted by blood vessel endothelial cells and monocytes, also attract phagocytes to the area. Chemokines constitute a group of about 50 different proteins that bind to receptors on many types of leukocytes and induce numerous other changes central to inflammation. For example, they induce the production of toxic forms of oxygen in phagocyte lysosomes and the release of histamine from basophils.

Neutrophils are the first phagocytes to arrive at the point of assault, followed by macrophages that have developed from migrating monocytes. Macrophages not only phagocytose pathogens and their products, but also clean up damaged tissue cells and the remains of neutrophils destroyed in the phagocytic process. The pus that accumulates at the site of some infections consists mostly of dead phagocytic cells and the fluid and proteins that leaked from the capillaries during the inflammatory response. Usually, the pus is absorbed by the body within a few days.

A sliver or other minor injury causes localized inflammation, as you have just seen, but the body may also mount a systemic (widespread) nonspecific response to severe tissue damage or infection. Injured cells often put out a call for reinforcements, emitting chemicals that stimulate the release of more neutrophils from the bone marrow. In a severe infection such as meningitis or appendicitis, the number of leukocytes in the blood may increase severalfold within a few hours of the initial inflammatory events. Another systemic response to infection is fever. Toxins produced by pathogens may trigger the fever, but certain leukocytes also release molecules called pyrogens, which set the body's thermostat at a higher temperature. A very high fever may be dangerous, but a moderate fever contributes to defense by inhibiting the growth of some microorganisms. Fever may also facilitate phagocytosis and, by speeding up body reactions, may speed the repair of tissues.

Certain bacterial infections can induce an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response leading to a condition known as septic shock. Characterized by high fever and low blood pressure, septic shock is the most common cause of death in U.S. critical care units. Clearly, while local inflammation is an essential step toward healing, widespread inflammation can be devastating.

Antimicrobial Proteins

A variety of proteins function in nonspecific defense either by attacking microbes directly or by impeding their reproduction. You have already learned about lysozyme, an antimicrobial enzyme present in tears, saliva, and mucous secretions. Other antimicrobial agents include a set of about 20 serum proteins, known collectively as the complement system, that carry out a cascade of steps leading to the lysis of microbes. Some complement components also function along with chemokines in attracting phagocytic cells to sites of infection. Complement proteins are an essential part of both nonspecific and specific defense. We will learn about them in detail later in this chapter.

Another set of proteins that provide nonspecific defense are the interferons, which are secreted by virus-infected cells. While they do not seem to benefit the infected cell, these antiviral proteins diffuse to neighboring cells and induce them to produce other chemicals that inhibit viral reproduction. In this way, interferons limit the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in the body, helping to control viral infections such as colds and influenza. The defense is not virus-specific; interferons produced in response to one virus may confer short-term resistance to unrelated viruses. In addition to its role as an antiviral agent, one type of interferon activates phagocytes, enhancing their ability to ingest and kill microorganisms. Interferons can now be mass-produced by recombinant DNA technology and are being tested clinically for the treatment of viral infections and cancer.

Let's review the body's nonspecific forms of defense: The first line of defense, the skin and mucous membranes, prevents most microbes from entering the body; the second line of defense uses phagocytes, natural killer cells, inflammation, and antimicrobial proteins to defend against microbes that have managed to enter the body. These two lines of defense are nonspecific in that they do not distinguish among pathogens.





 Lymphocytes provide the specificity and diversity of the immune system

The vertebrate body is populated by two main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells). Like macrophages, both types of lymphocytes circulate throughout the blood and lymph and are concentrated in the spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissues (see FIGURE 43.4). Because lymphocytes recognize and respond to particular microbes and foreign molecules, they are said to display specificity. A foreign molecule that elicits a specific response by lymphocytes is called an antigen. Antigens include molecules belonging to viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Antigenic molecules are also found on the surfaces of foreign materials such as pollen and transplanted tissue. B cells and T cells specialize in different types of antigens, and they carry out different, but complementary, defensive actions, as we will see later. One way that an antigen elicits an immune response is by activating B cells to secrete proteins called antibodies. The term antigen is a contraction of antibody-generator: Each antigen has a particular molecular shape and stimulates certain B cells to secrete antibodies that interact specifically with it. In fact, B and T cells can distinguish among antigens with molecular shapes that are only slightly different. So, in contrast to the nonspecific defenses, the immune system targets specific invaders.

The means by which B cells and T cells recognize specific antigens are their plasma membrane-bound antigen receptors. Antigen receptors on a B cell are actually transmembrane versions of antibody molecules and are often referred to as membrane antibodies (or membrane immunoglobulins). The antigen receptors on a T cell, called T cell receptors, are structurally related to membrane antibodies, and they recognize antigens just as specifically. But, unlike antibodies, T cell receptors are never produced in a secreted form. A single T or B lymphocyte bears about 100,000 receptors for antigen, all with exactly the same specificity. The particular structure of a lymphocyte's receptors is determined by genetic events that occur in the lymphocyte during its early development (see FIGURE 19.6). As an unspecialized cell differentiates into a B or T lymphocyte, segments of antibody genes or receptor genes are linked together by a type of genetic recombination, generating a single functional gene for each polypeptide of an antibody or receptor protein. This process, which occurs before any contact with foreign antigens, creates an enormous variety of B and T cells in the body, each bearing antigen receptors of particular specificity. With this diversity of lymphocytes, the immune system has the capacity to respond to millions of different antigenic molecules (even ones that do not yet exist)--and thus to millions of different potential pathogens.





 Antigens interact with specific lymphocytes, inducing immune responses and immunological memory

Although it encounters a large repertoire of B cells and T cells in the body, a microorganism interacts only with lymphocytes bearing receptors specific for its various antigenic molecules. The "selection" of a lymphocyte by one of the microbe's antigens activates the lymphocyte, stimulating it to divide and to differentiate. Eventually the lymphocyte forms two clones of cells. One clone consists of a large number of effector cells, short-lived cells that combat the same antigen. The other clone consists of memory cells, long-lived cells bearing receptors specific for the same antigen. This antigen-driven cloning of lymphocytes is called clonal selection (FIGURE 43.6). The concept of clonal selection is so fundamental to understanding immunity that it is worth restating: Each antigen, by binding to specific receptors, selectively activates a tiny fraction of cells from the body's diverse pool of lymphocytes; this relatively small number of selected cells gives rise to clones of thousands of cells, all specific for and dedicated to eliminating that antigen.

Fig 43-6. Clonal selection. The B cells and T cells in lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs collectively recognize an enormous number of antigens, but each individual cell recognizes only one type of antigen. In this diagram, a B cell is "selected" by an antigen to proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and antibody-secreting cells called plasma cells. For simplicity, we show the anti-gen as free molecules rather than as part of a microbe.

The selective proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes that occurs the first time the body is exposed to an antigen is the primary immune response. In the primary response, about 10 to 17 days are required from the initial exposure to antigen for selected lymphocytes to generate the maximum effector cell response. During this period, selected B cells and T cells generate antibody-producing effector B cells, called plasma cells, and effector T cells, respectively. While these effector cells are developing, a stricken individual may become ill. Eventually, symptoms of illness diminish and disappear as antibodies and effector T cells clear the antigen from the body. If that individual is exposed to the same antigen at some later time, the response is faster (only 2 to 7 days), of greater magnitude, and more prolonged. This is the secondary immune response. Measures of antibody concentrations in the blood serum over time show clearly the difference between primary and secondary immune responses (FIGURE 43.7). In addition to being more numerous, antibodies produced in the secondary response tend to have greater affinity for the antigen than those secreted in the primary response. The immune system's capacity to generate secondary immune responses is called immunological memory. As you have seen, an initial exposure to an antigen gives rise not only to effector cells but also to clones of long-lived T and B memory cells (see FIGURE 43.6). The memory cells are poised to proliferate and differentiate rapidly when they later contact the same antigen. The long-term protection developed after exposure to a pathogen was recognized 2,400 years ago by Thucydides of Athens, who described how those sick and dying of plague were cared for by others who had recovered, "for no one was ever attacked a second time."

Fig 43-7. Immunological memory. This experiment demonstrates that the heightened secondary response, which is due to long-lived memory cells, is specific for a particular antigen--here, antigen A.





 Lymphocyte development gives rise to an immune system that distinguishes self from nonself

Lymphocytes, like all blood cells, originate from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow or liver of a developing fetus. Early lymphocytes are all alike, but they later develop into T cells or B cells, depending on where they continue their maturation (FIGURE 43.8). Lymphocytes that migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, a gland in the thoracic cavity above the heart, develop into T cells ("T" for thymus). Lymphocytes that remain in the bone marrow and continue their maturation there become B cells. The "B" actually stands for the bursa of Fabricius, an organ unique to birds where avian B cells mature, and the place where B lymphocytes were first discovered. But since the B cells of all other vertebrates develop in bone marrow, you can equate "B" with "bone" as well as with "bursa."

Fig 43-8. The development of lymphocytes. Like other blood cells, lymphocytes differentiate from pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow (see FIGURE 42.14). Lymphocytes that continue their maturation in bone marrow develop into B cells, while lymphocytes that move to the thymus and complete their maturation there differentiate into T cells. When mature, lymphocytes of both classes migrate to the other lymphatic organs, where they encounter antigens (see FIGURE 43.4).

Immune Tolerance for Self

While B cells and T cells are maturing in the bone marrow and thymus, their antigen receptors are tested for potential self-reactivity. For the most part, lymphocytes bearing receptors specific for molecules already present in the body are either rendered nonfunctional or destroyed by apoptosis (programmed cell death; see FIGURE 21.18), leaving only lymphocytes that react to foreign molecules. This capacity to distinguish self from nonself continues to develop even as the cells migrate to lymphatic organs. Thus, the body normally has no mature lymphocytes that react against self components: The immune system exhibits the critical feature of self-tolerance. Failure of self-tolerance can lead to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. As you will see in the next section, certain body cell surface molecules are essential in the development of T cell self-tolerance as well as in T cell activity.

The Role of Cell Surface Markers in T Cell Function and Development

Lymphocytes do not react to most self antigens, but T cells do have a crucial interaction with one important group of native molecules. These are a collection of cell surface glycoproteins (proteins with attached sugar chains) encoded by a family of genes called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In humans, the MHC glycoproteins are also known as the HLA (for human leukocyte antigens). Two main classes of MHC molecules mark body cells as "self."Class I MHC molecules are found on almost all nucleated cells--that is, on almost every cell of the body. Class II MHC molecules are restricted to a few specialized cell types, including macrophages, B cells, activated T cells, and the cells that make up the interior of the thymus.

For a vertebrate species, there are numerous different possible alleles for each class I and class II MHC gene; the MHC proteins are the most polymorphic known. As a result of the large number of different alleles in the human population, for example, most of us are heterozygous for every one of our MHC genes. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that any two people, except identical twins, will have exactly the same set of MHC molecules. Thus, the major histocompatibility complex provides a biochemical fingerprint virtually unique to each individual. In fact, the discovery of the MHC occurred in the process of studying the phenomena of skin graft rejection and acceptance; the histo in histocompatibility refers to tissues.

The MHC and its role in the body's rejection of tissue grafts initially puzzled scientists: Why would the vertebrate body have evolved markers that prevent members of the same species from sharing tissues? We now know that MHC molecules are varied from person to person because of their central role in the immune response. Through a process known as antigen presentation, an MHC molecule cradles a fragment of an intracellular protein antigen in its hammocklike groove, carries it to the cell surface, and "presents" it to an antigen receptor on a nearby T cell. Thus T cells are alerted to an infectious agent after it has been internalized by a cell (through phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis), or after it has entered and replicated within a cell (through virus infection). There are two main types of T cells, and each responds to one of the two classes of MHC molecule. Cytotoxic T cells (TC) have antigen receptors that bind to protein fragments (peptides) displayed by the body's class I MHC molecules (FIGURE 43.9a). Helper T cells (TH) have receptors that bind to peptides displayed by the body's class II MHC molecules (FIGURE 43.9b).

Fig 43-9. The interaction of T cells with MHC molecules. Molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surfaces of body cells "present" antigen fragments to T cells. (a) Cytotoxic T cells have receptors for antigen-bearing class I MHC molecules. (b) Helper T cells have receptors for antigen-bearing class II MHC molecules.

Whether or not T cells respond to a pathogen, then, depends on the ability of MHC molecules to present a fragment of it. Fortunately, any one MHC molecule can present a variety of peptides that are structurally similar, and, because of the heterozygosity of our MHC genes, we each make two different MHC polypeptides per gene. So chances are good that at least one of our MHC molecules will be able to present at least one fragment of a particular pathogen to our T cells--and generate an immune response against it. In addition, human populations benefit from having hundreds of different MHC alleles in the gene pool, so that individual collections of MHC molecules vary from person to person. This polymorphism is adaptive because it increases the likelihood that at least some individuals of a population will survive an epidemic.

Let's look at the distribution and roles of class I and class II MHC molecules in the body, in terms of how they defend us against infection. Class I MHC molecules, found in almost all cells, are poised to present fragments of proteins made by infecting microbes, usually viruses, to cytotoxic T cells. As we will see in detail later, cytotoxic T cells respond by killing the infected cells. Because all of our cells are vulnerable to infection by one or another virus, the wide distribution of class I MHC molecules is critical to our health. Class II MHC molecules, on the other hand, are made by only a few cell types, chiefly macrophages and B cells. These cells, called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in this context, ingest bacteria (and viruses) and then destroy them. Class II MHC molecules in these cells collect peptide remnants of this degradation and present them to helper T cells. In response, the helper T cells send out chemical signals that incite other cell types to fight the pathogen.

MHC proteins also play a key role in the development of T-cell self-tolerance. During the development of T cells in the thymus, developing T cells interact with other thymic cells, which have high levels of both class I and class II MHC molecules. Only T cells bearing receptors with affinity for self MHC proteins reach maturity. Developing T cells having receptors with affinity for class I MHC become cytotoxic T cells. Those having receptors with affinity for class II MHC become helper T cells.

Now let's review what you've learned so far about the immune system: The immune responses of B and T lymphocytes exhibit four attributes that characterize the immune system as a whole: specificity, diversity, memory, and the capacity to distinguish self from nonself. A critical component of the immune response is the MHC: Proteins encoded by this gene complex display a combination of self (MHC molecule) and nonself (antigen fragment) that is recognized by specific T cells. In the following section you will learn more about how lymphocytes recognize and respond to foreign substances, and how they generate immunity.





 Helper T lymphocytes function in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity:

an overview

Before we look at the function of helper T lymphocytes, we must return to the MHC and its role in antigen presentation. Recall that class II MHC molecules, the ones recognized by helper T cells, are found only on certain cell types, mainly those that engulf foreign antigens. These antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages and some B cells, tell the immune system, via helper T cells, that foreign antigen is in the body. For example, a macrophage that has engulfed and broken down a bacterium contains small fragments of bacterial proteins. As a newly made class II MHC molecule moves toward the macrophage surface, it captures one of these bacterial peptides in its antigen-binding groove and carries it to the surface, revealing the foreign peptide to a helper T cell (FIGURE 43.11, p. 910). The interaction between an APC and a helper T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called CD4. Present on most helper T cells, CD4 binds to part of the class II MHC protein. The interaction between CD4 and a class II MHC molecule helps keep the helper T cell and the APC joined while activation of the TH cell occurs.

Fig 43-11. The central role of helper T cells: a closer look. Helper T cells mobilize both humoral and cell-mediated branches of the immune response. The  indicates stimulation.

When a helper T cell is selected by specific contact with the class II MHC-antigen complex on an APC, the TH cell proliferates and differentiates into a clone of activated helper T cells and memory helper T cells. Activated helper T cells secrete several different cytokines, proteins or peptides that stimulate other lymphocytes. For example, the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps B cells that have contacted antigen differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL-2 also helps cytotoxic T cells become active killers.

The helper T cell itself is also subject to regulation by cytokines. As a macrophage phagocytoses and presents antigen, the macrophage is stimulated to secrete a cytokine called interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-1, in combination with the presented antigen, is what activates the helper T cell to produce IL-2 and other cytokines. Also, in an example of positive feedback, IL-2 secreted by the helper T cell stimulates that same cell to proliferate more rapidly and to become an even more active cytokine producer. In these ways, helper T cells modulate both humoral (B cell) and cell-mediated (cytotoxic T cell) immune responses.





 In the cell-mediated response, cytotoxic T cells counter intracellular pathogens:

a closer look

Antigen-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill cancer cells and cells infected by viruses or other intracellular pathogens. Before we look at these events, we must return to class I MHC proteins and their role in presenting antigen to cytotoxic T cells. Recall that all nucleated cells of the body continuously produce class I MHC molecules. As a newly synthesized class I molecule moves toward the cell surface, it captures a small fragment of one of the other proteins synthesized by that cell. If that cell happens to contain a replicating virus, peptide fragments of viral proteins are captured and transported to the cell surface. In this way, class I MHC molecules expose foreign proteins that are synthesized in infected or abnormal cells to cytotoxic T cells. The interaction between the antigen-presenting infected cell and a cytotoxic T cell is greatly enhanced by the presence of a T cell surface protein called CD8. Present on most cytotoxic T cells, CD8 binds to a portion of the class I MHC molecule. The CD8-class I MHC interaction helps keep the two cells in contact while activation of the TC cell is occurring (FIGURE 43.12). Thus, the roles of class I MHC molecules and CD8 are similar to those of class II MHC molecules and CD4, except that different cells are involved.

Fig 43-12. The functioning of cytotoxic T cells. (a) A cytotoxic T cell (TC cell) responds to an infected cell (or cancer cell) that displays an antigen fragment recognized by its T-cell receptor. A class I MHC molecule presents the antigen fragment. (b) In this SEM, the TC cell has lysed the cancer cell.

A cytotoxic T cell, when activated by specific contacts with class I MHC-antigen complexes on an infected cell and further stimulated by IL-2 from a helper T cell, differentiates into an active killer. It kills its target cell--the antigen-presenting cell--primarily by releasing perforin, a protein that forms pores in the target cell's membrane. As ions and water flow into the target cell, it swells and eventually lyses (see FIGURE 43.12a). The death of the infected cell not only deprives the pathogen of a place to reproduce but also exposes it to circulating antibodies, which mark it for disposal. After destroying an infected cell, the TC cell moves on to kill other cells infected with the same pathogen.

In the same way, TC cells defend against malignant tumors. Because tumor cells carry distinctive molecules not found on normal cells, they are identified as foreign by the immune system. Class I MHC molecules on a tumor cell present fragments of tumor antigen to TC cells. Interestingly, certain cancers and viruses (such as Epstein-Barr virus) actively reduce the amount of class I MHC protein on affected cells so that they escape detection by TC cells. The body has a backup defense: Natural killer (NK) cells, part of the body's nonspecific defenses, also lyse virus-infected and cancer cells.





 In the humoral response, B cells make antibodies against extracellular pathogens:

a closer look

You have learned that the humoral immune response is initiated when B cells bearing antigen receptors are selected by binding with specific antigens. You also know that B cell activation is aided by IL-2 and other cytokines secreted from helper T cells activated by the same antigen. Stimulated by both antigen and cytokines, the B cell proliferates and differentiates into a clone of antibody-secreting plasma cells and a clone of memory B cells. Antigens that evoke this type of B cell response are known as T-dependent antigens because they can stimulate antibody production only with help from TH cells (FIGURE 43.13). Most protein antigens are T-dependent.

Fig 43-13. Humoral response to a T-dependent antigen. Many antigens can trigger a humoral (antibody-mediated) immune response by B cells only with the participation of helper T cells. Such antigens are called T-dependent antigens, and most protein antigens are of this type.

Other antigens, such as polysaccharides and proteins with many identical polypeptides, function as T-independent antigens. Such antigens include the polysaccharides of many bacterial capsules and the proteins that make up bacterial flagella. Apparently, the repeated subunits of these antigens bind simultaneously to a number of membrane antibodies on the B cell surface. This provides enough stimulus to the B cell to generate antibody-secreting plasma cells without the help of IL-2. The response to T-independent antigens is very important in defending against many bacteria; however, the response is generally weaker than the response to T-dependent antigens, and no memory cells are generated in T-independent responses.

Before we leave our discussion of B cell function, it is important to recall that B cells bear class II MHC molecules: They are antigen-presenting cells. When antigen first binds to membrane antibodies, the B cell takes in a few of the foreign molecules by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see FIGURE 8.19c). In a process very similar to presentation by macrophages, the B cell presents antigen to a helper T cell. However, although a macrophage can engulf and present peptide fragments from a wide variety of antigens, a B cell internalizes and presents peptides of only the antigen to which it specifically binds. Therefore, immunologists think that macrophages are the main APCs in the primary response (when B cells specific for a particular antigen are rare), whereas B cells, specifically memory B cells, are more important as APCs in secondary responses.

In any given humoral response, the processes just discussed stimulate a variety of different B cells, each giving rise to a clone of thousands of plasma cells. Each plasma cell is estimated to secrete about 2,000 antibody molecules per second over the cell's 4- to 5-day life span. Next we look more closely at antibodies and how they bind to and mediate the disposal of antigens.

Antibody Structure and Function

Antigens that elicit a humoral immune response are typically the protein and polysaccharide surface components of microbes, incompatible transplanted tissue, or incompatible transfused blood cells. In addition, for some of us, the proteins of foreign substances such as pollen or bee venom act as antigens that induce an allergic, or hypersensitive, humoral response (to be discussed later).

Neither the membrane version of the antibody--that is, the B cell receptor for antigen--nor the secreted antibody actually binds an entire antigen molecule. Rather, an antibody interacts with a small, accessible portion of the antigen called an epitope or antigenic determinant (FIGURE 43.14). A single antigen such as a bacterial surface protein usually has several effective epitopes, each capable of inducing the production of specific antibody. It is therefore easy to imagine the entire surface of a bacterium coated with many different kinds of antibodies, each specific for a particular epitope. It is estimated that a bacterium can be bound by 4 million antibody molecules!

Fig 43-14. Epitopes (antigenic determinants). Antibodies bind to epitopes on the surface of an antigen. In this example, three different antibody molecules react with different epitopes on the same large antigen molecule.

Antibodies constitute a group of globular serum proteins called immunoglobulins (Igs). A typical antibody molecule has two identical antigen-binding sites specific for the epitope that provoked its production. Each molecule consists of four polypeptide chains, two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, joined by disulfide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule (FIGURE 43.15a). At the two tips of the Y-shaped molecule are the variable regions (V) of the heavy and light chains, so named because the amino acid sequences in these regions vary extensively from antibody to antibody (see FIGURE 19.6). As shown in FIGURE 43.15b, a heavy-chain V region and a light-chain V region together form the unique contours of an antibody's antigen-binding site. The interaction between an antigen-binding site and its epitope resembles an enzyme-substrate interaction: Multiple noncovalent bonds form between chemical groups on the respective molecules, resulting in a highly stable complex.

Fig 43-15. The structure of a typical antibody molecule.

The power of antibody specificity and antigen-antibody binding has been harnessed for use in laboratory research, clinical diagnosis, and the treatment of diseases. Some of these antibody tools are polyclonal: They are the products of many different clones of B cells, each specific for a different epitope. Others are monoclonal: They are prepared from a single clone of B cells grown in culture. Because they are all identical, the monoclonal antibodies produced by such a culture are specific for the same epitope on an antigen. In both basic research and medicine, antibodies are useful for tagging specific molecules. For example, certain types of cancer have been treated with tumor-specific antibodies covalently coupled to toxin molecules. The toxin-linked antibodies carry out a precise search-and-destroy mission, selectively attaching to and killing tumor cells.

While the antigen-binding sites on an antibody are responsible for its ability to identify a specific antigen, the tail of the Y-shaped antibody, formed by the constant regions (C) of the heavy chains (see FIGURE 43.15a), is responsible for the antibody's distribution in the body and for the mechanisms by which it mediates antigen disposal. There are five major types of heavy-chain constant regions, and these determine the five major classes of antibodies: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE. The structures and functions of each of the five immunoglobulin classes are summarized in TABLE 43.1. Note that each light chain also has a constant region. It is not a part of the antibody tail and does not contribute to Ig class functions.

Table 43-1. The Five Classes of Immunoglobulins

IgM (pentamer)



IgMs are the first circulating antibodies to appear in response to an initial exposure to an antigen; their concentration in the blood then declines rapidly. Thus the presence of IgM usually indicates a current infection. IgM consists of five Y-shaped monomers arranged in a pentagonal structure. The numerous antigen-binding sites make it very effective in agglutinating antigens and in reactions involving complement. IgM is too large to cross the placenta and does not confer maternal immunity.IgG (monomer)



IgG is the most abundant of the circulating antibodies. It readily crosses the walls of blood vessels and enters tissue fluids. IgG also crosses the placenta and confers passive immunity on the fetus. IgG protects against bacteria, viruses, and toxins in the blood and lymph, and triggers action of the complement system.IgA (dimer)



IgA is produced by cells in mucous membranes. The main function of IgA is to prevent the attachment of viruses and bacteria to epithelial surfaces. IgA is also found in many body secretions, such as saliva, perspiration, and tears. Its presence in the first milk produced helps protect the infant from gastrointestinal infections.IgD (monomer)



IgD antibodies do not activate the complement system and cannot cross the placenta. They are mostly found on the surfaces of B cells, probably functioning as antigen receptors that help initiate the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and memory B cells.IgE (monomer)



IgE molecules are slightly larger than IgG and represent only a small fraction of the antibodies in the blood. The tails attach to mast cells and basophils and, when triggered by an antigen, cause the cells to release histamine and other chemicals that cause an allergic reaction.Antibody-Mediated Disposal of Antigen

The binding of antibodies to antigens to form antigen-antibody complexes is the basis of several antigen disposal mechanisms (FIGURE 43.16, p. 914). The simplest of these is neutralization, in which the antibody binds to and blocks the activity of the antigen. For example, antibodies neutralize a virus by attaching to the molecules that the virus must use to infect its host cell. Similarly, antibodies may bind to the surface of a pathogenic bacterium. These microbes, now coated by antibodies, are readily eliminated by phagocytosis. In a process called opsonization, the bound antibodies enhance macrophage attachment to, and thus phagocytosis of, the microbes.

Fig 43-16. Effector mechanisms of humoral immunity. The binding of antibodies to antigens tags foreign cells and molecules for destruction by phagocytes or the complement system of proteins.

Antibody-mediated agglutination (clumping) of bacteria or viruses effectively neutralizes and opsonizes the microbes. Agglutination is possible because each antibody molecule has at least two antigen-binding sites. IgG, for example, can bind to identical epitopes on two bacterial cells or viral particles, linking them together. IgM can link together five or more viruses or bacteria (as shown in FIGURE 43.16). These large complexes are readily phagocytosed by macrophages. A similar mechanism is precipitation, the cross-linking of soluble antigen molecules--molecules dissolved in body fluids--to form immobile precipitates that are disposed of by phagocytes.

One of the most important antibody-mediated disposal mechanisms is complement fixation, the activation of the complement system by antigen-antibody complexes. Recall that complement consists of about 20 different serum proteins that, in the absence of infection, are inactive. In an infection, however, the first in the series of complement proteins is activated, triggering a cascade of activation steps, each component activating the next in the series. Completion of the complement cascade results in the lysis of many types of viruses and pathogenic cells. Lysis by complement can be achieved in two ways. The classical pathway (so called because it was discovered first) is triggered by antibodies bound to antigen and is therefore important in the humoral immune response. The alternative pathway is triggered by substances that are naturally present on many bacteria, yeast, viruses, and protozoan parasites; it does not involve antibodies and thus is an important nonspecific defense.

The classical pathway can begin when IgM or IgG antibodies bind to a pathogen, such as a bacterial cell (FIGURE 43.17). The first complement component links two bound antibodies and is thus activated, initiating the cascade. Ultimately, complement proteins generate a membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms a pore in the bacterial membrane 7-10 nm in diameter. Ions and water rush into the cell, causing it to swell and lyse. The MAC pore is similar to the perforin pore generated by cytotoxic T cells.

Fig 43-17. The classical complement pathway, resulting in lysis of a target cell.

In both the classical and alternative pathways, many activated complement proteins contribute to inflammation. By binding to basophils and mast cells, some trigger the release of histamine, the injury-signaling molecule that triggers dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels. Several active complement proteins also attract phagocytes to the site. In addition, one of the activated complement proteins can cause opsonization: Copies of this protein coat bacterial surfaces and, like antibodies, stimulate phagocytosis. In a final example of teamwork in the body's defense systems, antibodies, complement, and phagocytes function together in a phenomenon called immune adherence. Microbes coated with antibodies and complement proteins adhere to blood vessel walls, making the pathogens easier prey for phagocytic cells circulating in the blood.

You have seen that antibodies contribute in several ways to phagocytosis by macrophages. Keep in mind that phagocytosis enables macrophages to act as APCs, stimulating helper T cells, which, in turn, stimulate the very B cells whose antibodies contribute to phagocytosis. Thus, positive feedback links together the nonspecific and specific immune systems, resulting in a coordinated and effective response to an active infection.





 Invertebrates have a rudimentary immune system

Although this chapter focuses on the immune mechanisms of vertebrates, invertebrate animals also exhibit highly effective mechanisms of host defense, which undoubtedly have contributed to their evolutionary success. The ability to make the distinction betwen self and nonself is seen in animals as ancient as the sponges. If cells from two sponges of the same species are mixed, the cells from each sponge sort themselves and reaggregate, each excluding cells from the other individual. Invertebrates also have the ability to dispose of what is not self, which they accomplish primarily by phagocytosis. In sea stars, for example, amoeboid cells called coelomocytes phagocytose foreign matter. Furthermore, immunologists have begun to find cytokines in invertebrates. For example, like mammalian macrophages, sea star coelomocytes produce interleukin-1 as they engulf foreign material. The IL-1 enhances the animal's defensive response by stimulating coelomocyte proliferation and attracting more coelomocytes to the area.

Invertebrates depend on innate, nonspecific mechanisms of defense rather than acquired, antigen-specific mechanisms like those that vertebrates accomplish with lymphocytes. However, some invertebrates possess lymphocyte-like cells that produce antibody-like molecules. Insects, for example, have a hemolymph protein, called hemolin, that binds to microbes and assists in their disposal. Hemolin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a large group of proteins that are structurally related to antibodies. Hemolin molecules do not exhibit diversity, but they are likely evolutionary precursors of vertebrate antibodies.

By and large, invertebrates do not exhibit the hallmark of acquired immunity--immunological memory. Sea star coelomocytes, for example, respond to a particular microbe with the same speed no matter how many times they have encountered that invader before. However, earthworms do appear to have a kind of immunological memory. When a portion of body wall from one worm is grafted onto another, the recipient's phagocytic cells attack the foreign tissue. The initial graft is rejected in about two weeks; a second graft from the same donor is rejected in just a few days. Comparative studies of animal immune systems continue to provide insight into the development and evolution of host defense mechanisms, as well as clues about evolutionary patterns in general.





 Immunity can be achieved naturally or artificially

Immunity conferred by recovering from an infectious disease such as chicken pox is called active immunity because it depends on the response of the infected person's own immune system. As is the case with all such infections, this immunity is naturally acquired. Active immunity can also be acquired artificially, by immunization, also known as vaccination. Vaccines include inactivated bacterial toxins, killed microbes, parts of microbes, and viable but weakened microbes. These agents can no longer cause disease, but they retain the ability to act as antigens, stimulating an immune response, and more important, immunological memory. A vaccinated person who encounters the actual pathogen will have the same quick secondary response based on memory cells as a person who has had the disease. Routine immunization of infants and children has dramatically reduced the incidence of infectious diseases such as measles and whooping cough, and has led to the eradication of smallpox, a disfiguring and often fatal viral disease. Unfortunately, not all infectious agents are easily managed by vaccination. For example, although researchers are working intensively to develop a vaccine for HIV, they face many problems, such as the antigenic variability of the virus.

Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another, providing passive immunity. This occurs naturally when IgG antibodies of a pregnant woman cross the placenta to her fetus. In addition, IgA antibodies are passed from mother to nursing infant in breast milk, especially in the early secretions called colostrum. Passive immunity persists only as long as these antibodies last (a few weeks to a few months), but it provides protection from infections until the baby's own immune system has matured. Passive immunity can also be transferred artificially by injecting antibodies from an animal that is already immune to a disease into another animal, conferring short-term but immediate protection against that disease. Thus, for example, a person bitten by a rabid animal may be injected with antibodies from other people who have been vaccinated against rabies. This measure is important because rabies may progress rapidly, and the response to an active immunization could take too long to save the life of the victim. Actually, most people infected with rabies virus are given both passive and active immunizations: The injected antibodies fight the virus for a few weeks, and then the person's own immune response, induced by the immunization and the infection itself, takes over.





 The immune system's capacity to distinguish self from nonself limits blood transfusion and tissue transplantation

In addition to distinguishing between the body's own cells and pathogens such as bacteria, the immune system, given the opportunity, wages war against cells from other individuals. For example, skin transplanted from one person to a nonidentical person will look healthy for a day or two, but it will then be destroyed by immune responses. Interestingly, however, a pregnant woman does not reject the fetus as a foreign body. Apparently, the structure of the placenta is the key to this acceptance (see FIGURE 46.17).

In this section you will learn about the potential problems associated with blood transfusions and tissue transplants. Keep in mind that the body's hostile reaction to an incompatible transfusion or transplant is not a disorder of the immune system, but a normal reaction of a healthy immune system exposed to foreign antigens.

Blood Groups and Blood Transfusion

The genetic basis for the ABO blood groups was discussed in Chapter 14. An individual with type A blood has A antigens on the surface of his or her red blood cells. The A molecule is referred to as an antigen because it may be identified as foreign if placed in the body of another person; the A antigen is not antigenic to its "owner." Similarly, B antigens are found on type B red blood cells, A and B antigens are found on type AB red blood cells, and neither antigen is found on type O red blood cells.

An individual with type A blood will not, of course, produce antibodies to A antigens. However, a person with type A blood has antibodies to the B antigen, even if the person has never been exposed to type B blood. You may find it odd that antibodies to foreign blood group antigens exist in the body even in the absence of an incompatible blood transfusion. These antibodies arise in response to bacteria (normal flora) that have epitopes very similar to blood group antigens. Thus an individual with type A blood does not make antibodies to A-like bacterial epitopes--the immune system considers these as self--but that person does make antibodies to B-like bacterial epitopes. Therefore, if a person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, the preexisting anti-B antibodies will induce an immediate and devastating transfusion reaction. The ABO blood types and corresponding antibodies are summarized in FIGURE 14.10.

Because blood group antigens are polysaccharides, they induce T-independent responses, which elicit no memory cells. As a result, each response is like a primary response, and it generates IgM anti-blood-group antibodies, not IgG. This is fortunate; because IgM does not cross the placenta, no harm comes to a developing fetus with a blood type different from its mother's. However, another red blood cell antigen, the Rh factor, is able to cause trouble because antibodies produced to it are of the IgG class. A potentially dangerous situation can arise when a mother is Rh-negative (lacks the Rh factor) but has a fetus that is Rh-positive, having inherited the factor from the father. If small amounts of fetal blood cross the placenta, as may happen late in pregnancy or during delivery of the baby, the mother mounts a T-dependent humoral response against the Rh factor. The danger occurs in subsequent Rh-positive pregnancies, when the mother's Rh-specific memory B cells are exposed to the Rh factor. These B cells produce IgG antibodies, which can cross the placenta and destroy the red cells of the fetus. To prevent this, the mother is injected with anti-Rh antibodies after delivering her first Rh-positive baby. She is, in effect, passively immunized (artificially) to eliminate the Rh antigen before her own immune system responds and generates immunological memory against the Rh factor, endangering her future Rh-positive babies.

Tissue Grafts and Organ Transplantation

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes the protein fingerprint unique to each individual, is responsible for stimulating the rejection of tissue grafts and organ transplants. Foreign MHC molecules are antigenic, inducing immune responses against the donated tissue or organ. To minimize rejection, attempts are made to match the MHC of the tissue donor and recipient as closely as possible. In the absence of an identical twin, siblings usually provide the closest tissue-type match. In addition to a close match, various medicines are necessary to suppress the immune response to the transplant. However, this strategy leaves the recipient more susceptible to infection and cancer during the course of treatment. More selective drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506, which suppress helper T cell activation without crippling nonspecific defense or T-independent humoral responses, have greatly improved the success of organ transplants.

In one type of life-giving transplant, that of bone marrow, the graft itself, rather than the host, is the source of potential immune rejection. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia and other cancers, as well as various hematological (blood cell) diseases. As in any transplant, the MHC of donor and recipient are matched as closely as possible. Prior to transplant, the recipient is typically treated with irradiation to eliminate his or her own bone marrow cells, including any abnormal cells. This treatment effectively obliterates the recipient's immune system, leaving little chance of graft rejection. However, the great danger in bone marrow transplants is that the donated marrow, containing lymphocytes, will react against the recipient. This graft versus host reaction is limited if the MHC molecules of the donor and recipient are well matched. Bone marrow donor programs around the world continually seek volunteers; because of the great variability of the MHC, a diverse pool of potential donors is essential.





 Abnormal immune function can lead to disease

The highly regulated interplay of lymphocytes with foreign substances, with each other, and with other body cells provides us with extraordinary protection from many diseases. However, if this delicate balance is disrupted by an immune system malfunction, the effects on the individual can range from the minor inconvenience of some allergies to the serious and often fatal consequences of certain autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases.

Allergies

Allergies are hypersensitive (exaggerated) responses to certain environmental antigens, called allergens. One hypothesis to explain the origin of allergies is that they are evolutionary remnants of the immune system's response to parasitic worms. The humoral mechanism that combats worms is similar to the allergic response that causes such disorders as hay fever and allergic asthma.

The most common allergies involve antibodies of the IgE class (see TABLE 43.1). Hay fever, for example, occurs when plasma cells secrete IgE specific for pollen allergens. Some of the IgE antibodies attach by their tails to mast cells present in connective tissues, without binding to the pollen. Later, when pollen grains enter the body, they attach to the antigen-binding sites of mast cell-associated IgE, cross-linking adjacent antibody molecules. This event induces the mast cell to degranulate--that is, to release histamine and other inflammatory agents from vesicles called granules (FIGURE 43.18, p. 918). Recall that histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels. These inflammatory events lead to typical allergy symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, tearing eyes, and smooth muscle contractions that can result in breathing difficulty. Antihistamines diminish allergy symptoms by blocking receptors for histamine.

Fig 43-18. Mast cells, IgE, and the allergic response.

Sometimes, an acute allergic response can result in anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening reaction to injected or ingested allergens. Anaphylactic shock occurs when widespread mast cell degranulation triggers abrupt dilation of peripheral blood vessels, causing a precipitous drop in blood pressure. Death may occur within a few minutes. Allergic responses to bee venom or penicillin can lead to anaphylactic shock in people who are extremely allergic to these substances. Likewise, people very allergic to peanuts, fish, or other foods have died from eating only tiny amounts of these allergens. Some individuals with severe hypersensitivities carry syringes containing the hormone epinephrine, which counteracts this allergic response.

Autoimmune Diseases

Sometimes the immune system loses tolerance for self and turns against certain molecules of the body, causing one of the many autoimmune diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), for example, the immune system generates antibodies (known as autoantibodies) against all sorts of self molecules, even histones and DNA released by the normal breakdown of body cells. Lupus is characterized by skin rashes, fever, arthritis, and kidney dysfunction. Another antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, leads to damage and painful inflammation of the cartilage and bone of joints. In insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are the targets of autoimmune cell-mediated responses. A final example is multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common chronic neurological disease in developed countries. In MS, T cells reactive against myelin infiltrate the central nervous system and destroy the myelin of neurons (see FIGURE 48.2). People with MS experience a number of serious neurological abnormalities.

The mechanisms that lead to autoimmunity are not fully understood. For a long time, it was thought that people with autoimmune diseases differed from healthy people in having self-reactive lymphocytes that happened to escape elimination during their development. We now know that healthy people also have lymphocytes with the capacity to react against self. However, these cells are prevented from inducing autoimmune reactions by a number of regulatory mechanisms. So, autoimmune disease likely arises from some failure in immune regulation. One intriguing finding is that the inheritance of particular MHC alleles is associated with susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Immunodeficiency Diseases

There are almost as many immunodeficiency diseases as there are components of the immune system. Many inborn deficiencies affect the function of either humoral or cell-mediated immune defenses. In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), both branches of the immune system fail to function. For people with this genetic disease, long-term survival usually requires a bone marrow transplant that will continue to supply functional lymphocytes. For one type of SCID, caused by deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA), medical scientists have been working to develop a gene therapy in which the individual's own cells are removed, provided with a functional ADA gene, and returned to the body. This treatment would eliminate the danger of graft versus host disease. However, the results to date are equivocal because the patients are also being given additional supplies of the enzyme. Gene therapy for several patients suffering from another type of SCID has also had equivocal results.

Immunodeficiency is not always an inborn condition; an individual may develop immune dysfunction later in life. For example, certain cancers suppress the immune system, especially Hodgkin's disease, which damages the lymphatic system. Another well-known and devastating acquired immune deficiency is AIDS, described in the next section.

Healthy immune function appears to depend on both the endocrine system and the nervous systems. Nearly 2,000 years ago the Greek physician Galen recorded that people suffering from depression were more likely than others to develop cancer. In fact, there is growing evidence that physical and emotional stress can harm immunity. Hormones secreted by the adrenal glands during stress affect the numbers of white blood cells and may suppress the immune system in other ways.

The association between emotional stress and immune function also involves the nervous system. Some neurotransmitters secreted when we are relaxed and happy may enhance immunity. In one study, college students were examined just after a vacation and again during final exams. Their immune systems were impaired in various ways during exam week; for example, interferon levels were lower. These and other observations indicate that general health and state of mind affect immunity. Physiological evidence also points to an immune system-nervous system link: Receptors for neurotransmitters have been discovered on the surfaces of lymphocytes, and a network of nerve fibers penetrates deep into the thymus.





 AIDS is an immunodeficiency disease caused by a virus

In 1981, health care workers in the United States noticed an increasing number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer of the skin and blood vessels, and of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii, a protozoan. The increased rates were notable because of the rarity of these diseases among the general population; they were known to occur mainly in severely immunosuppressed individuals. These observations led to the recognition of what came to be known as acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. People with AIDS are highly susceptible to opportunistic diseases, infections and cancers that take advantage of an immune system in collapse. The Pneumocystis protozoan is a ubiquitous organism, yet it does not cause pneumonia in a person with a healthy immune system. In people with AIDS, opportunistic diseases, neurologic damage, and physiological wasting lead to death.

By 1983, a retrovirus, now called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), had been identified as the causative agent of AIDS (FIGURE 43.19; also see FIGURE 18.7 and the interview that opens this unit). With the AIDS mortality rate close to 100% , HIV is the most lethal pathogen ever encountered. Molecular studies of HIV reveal that the virus probably evolved from another HIV-like virus in chimpanzees in central Africa and appeared in humans sometime between 1915 and 1940, causing rare cases of infection and AIDS that went unrecognized.

Fig 43-19. A T cell infected with HIV. The viruses (blue) bud continuously from the surface of the T cell (orange; colorized SEM). The cell will die, but only after it produces many copies of its viral killer.

There are two major strains of the virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more widely distributed and more virulent strain. Both strains infect cells that bear surface CD4 molecules. As you know, CD4 molecules are located on helper T cells and enhance the binding between those cells and class II MHC-bearing antigen-presenting cells. Because CD4 also functions as the major receptor for the virus, helper T cells are highly susceptible to infection. Other cell types that bear fewer CD4 molecules, such as macrophages, some B lymphocytes, and brain cells, are also among the cells infected by HIV.

The entry of the virus requires not only CD4 on the surface of the susceptible cell but also a second protein molecule, a coreceptor. The coreceptors identified so far include fusin (also called CXCR4), found on helper T cells, and CCR5, found on macrophages. Fusin and CCR5 normally function as receptors for chemokines. In fact, these molecules were first recognized as HIV coreceptors after it was discovered that chemokines can suppress HIV-1 infection. Apparently, chemokines bind to these receptors and block HIV-1 entry. Some people who are innately resistant to HIV-1 owe their resistance to defective chemokine receptors. They are not infected because their coreceptors for HIV are faulty.

Once inside a cell, HIV RNA is reverse-transcribed, and the product DNA is integrated into the host cell genome. In this provirus form, the viral genome directs the production of new virus particles (see FIGURE 18.7). Because a retrovirus exists as a provirus for the life of the infected cell, immune responses fail to eradicate it from the body. Even more challenging to both humoral and cell-mediated responses, however, are the frequent mutational changes that occur in each round of virus replication. Indeed, most HIV particles produced in an infected person differ at least slightly from the original infecting virus.

In spite of these challenges, the immune system engages in a prolonged battle against HIV. After an initial peak, the number of viruses in the blood falls while anti-HIV antibody rises (FIGURE 43.20). The decrease in the number of viruses in the blood results from the early immune response to HIV. Detection of the anti-HIV antibodies, which appear in the blood about 1 to 12 months after infection, is the most common method for identifying infected individuals. A person who is HIV-positive is infected, having tested positive for the presence of antibodies to the virus. The HIV antibody test has also been used to screen all blood supplies in the United States since 1985. Because of the chronic presence of virus, a person continues to have anti-HIV antibodies, perhaps until late in AIDS, when both branches of immunity collapse with the loss of helper T cells.

Fig 43-20. The stages of HIV infection.

The early fall in the level of HIV in the blood is misleading, however. While the number of circulating viruses may be low, viruses continue to be produced in cells of the lymph nodes, causing structural and functional damage there. In time, the concentration of HIV in the blood (the viral load) increases. Causes of this increase include the breakdown of lymphatic tissue function, the release of virus from these tissues, and diminishing responses to the infection because of the depletion of helper T cells (see FIGURE 43.20).

Recent studies have revealed that, in HIV infection, helper T cells die because they become infected with the virus. This may sound obvious; cells often die as a result of virus infection. However, other models for T cell depletion have been proposed to explain the apparent loss of helper T cells not infected by HIV. One model, for example, suggests that HIV-mediated interactions induce a T cell to undergo inappropriately timed apoptosis, a process that is normally highly regulated (see FIGURE 21.18). But while such a mechanism may contribute to helper T cell depletion, it is now thought that direct infection is the primary culprit. In fact, the half-life of an actively infected helper T cell (one producing new copies of HIV) is less than 1.5 days.

The time required for an HIV infection to progress to severe helper T cell depletion and AIDS varies greatly, but it currently averages about ten years. During most of this time the individual exhibits only moderate hints of illness, such as swollen lymph nodes (indicating ongoing virus activity) and occasional fever. People with HIV and their physicians follow changes in the level of T cells as an indication of disease progression. However, it has been shown that measures of viral load are a better indicator of disease prognosis and of the effectiveness of anti-HIV treatment.

At this time, HIV infection cannot be cured, and the progression to AIDS cannot be prevented. New drug combinations show promise in slowing this progression, but these therapies are very expensive and not available to all those with HIV infection. Drugs that seem to slow viral replication when used in various combinations include DNA-synthesis inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as AZT and ddI), and protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors prevent a key step in the synthesis of HIV proteins. Used simultaneously, these kinds of drugs decrease viral load and therefore allow the number of helper T cells to rise. Also important to people with AIDS are the numerous medicines used to treat the myriad of opportunistic diseases they develop. These drugs may prolong life, but they do not cure AIDS.

Transmission of HIV requires the transfer of body fluids containing infected cells, such as semen or blood, from person to person. Unprotected sex (that is, without a condom) among male homosexuals and transmission via nonsterile needles (typically among intravenous drug users) account for most of the AIDS cases reported thus far in the United States and Europe. However, transmission of HIV among heterosexuals is rapidly increasing as a result of unprotected sex with infected partners. In Africa and Asia, transmission has been primarily by heterosexual sex, especially where there is a high incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases that result in genital lesions. These sores facilitate the transmission of HIV, as the skin barrier (first line of defense) is breached and HIV-susceptible cells, mainly macrophages and helper T cells, are attracted to the area by the inflammatory response.

HIV is not transmitted by casual contact. So far, only one case of HIV transmission by kissing has been reported, and both the person who transmitted the virus and the recipient had bleeding gums. Although this case is isolated, it is important to remember that the virus can be transmitted whenever blood or body secretions are passed from one person to another. Transmission of HIV from mother to child can happen in two ways: during fetal development (as occurs in about 25%  of HIV-infected mothers) and during nursing. HIV antibody screening has virtually eliminated blood transfusions as a route of transmission in developed countries. This test, however, will never completely guarantee a safe blood supply because a person may be infected by the virus for several weeks or months before anti-HIV antibodies become detectable.

As of 2000 the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS estimates that 30 to 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV or HIV/AIDS. Of these, approximately 70%  reside in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of people with AIDS is expected to grow by nearly 20%  per year. The best approach for slowing the spread of HIV is to educate people about the practices that transmit the virus, such as using nonsterile needles and having sex without a condom. Although condoms do not completely eliminate the risk of transmitting HIV (or other similarly transmitted viruses, such as the hepatitis B virus), they do reduce it. Anyone who has sex--vaginal, oral, or anal--with a partner who had unprotected sex with another person during the past two decades risks exposure to HIV.

The immune response is one of many adaptations that enable animals to adjust to the adversities of the environment. The next chapter describes several other processes that help maintain favorable conditions within animals as they cope with varying external environments.





Chapter 44: REGULATING THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

AN OVERVIEW OF HOMEOSTASIS

   Regulating and conforming are the two extremes in how animals cope with environmental fluctuations

   Homeostasis balances an animal's gains versus losses for energy and materials



REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE

   Four physical processes account for heat gain or loss

   Ectotherms have body temperatures close to environmental temperature; endotherms can use metabolic heat to keep body temperature warmer than their surroundings

   Thermoregulation involves physiological and behavioral adjustments that balance heat gain and loss

   Most animals are ectothermic, but endothermy is widespread

   Torpor conserves energy during environmental extremes



WATER BALANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL

   Water balance and waste disposal depend on transport epithelia

   An animal's nitrogenous wastes are correlated with its phylogeny and habitat

   Cells require a balance between osmotic gain and loss of water

   Osmoregulators expend energy to control their internal osmolarity; osmoconformers are isoosmotic with their surroundings



EXCRETORY SYSTEMS

   Most excretory systems produce urine by refining a filtrate derived from body fluids: an overview

   Diverse excretory systems are variations on a tubular theme

   Nephrons and associated blood vessels are the functional units of the mammalian kidney

   The mammalian kidney's ability to conserve water is a key terrestrial adaptation

   Diverse adaptations of the vertebrate kidney have evolved in different habitats

   Interacting regulatory systems maintain homeostasis

One of the most remarkable characteristics of animals is that they can maintain physiologically favorable internal environments even as external conditions undergo dramatic shifts that would be lethal to individual cells. This ability of animals to regulate their internal environment is called homeostasis (see Chapters 1 and 40). An example is the regulation of body temperature. Humans may be exposed to substantial changes in outside temperatures but will die if their internal temperatures drift more than a few degrees above or below 3&#176;C. Another mammal, the arctic wolf you see in the photo above, is so effective at regulating body temperature that it survives winters when temperatures drop as low as -50&#176;C.

This chapter focuses on: thermoregulation, how animals maintain internal temperature within a tolerable range; osmoregulation, how they regulate solute balance and the gain and loss of water; and excretion, how they get rid of the nitrogen-containing waste products of metabolism such as urea. But first, we'll develop a couple of general concepts that provide additional context for our study of homeostasis.

REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE

 

 Four physical processes account for heat gain or loss



 

 Ectotherms have body temperatures close to environmental temperature; endotherms can use metabolic heat to keep body temperature warmer than their surroundings



 

 Thermoregulation involves physiological and behavioral adjustments that balance heat gain and loss



 

 Most animals are ectothermic, but endothermy is widespread



 

 Torpor conserves energy during environmental extremes



Most biochemical and physiological processes are very sensitive to changes in body temperature. The rates of most enzyme-mediated reactions increase by a factor of 2-3 for every 10&#176;C temperature increase, until temperature is high enough to begin to denature proteins. This is known as the Q10effect, with Q10 being the multiple by which a particular enzymatic reaction or overall metabolic process increases with a 10&#176;C increase in body temperature. For example, if the rate of glycogen hydrolysis in a frog is 2.5 times greater at 30&#176;C than at 20&#176;C, then the Q10 for that reaction is 2.5. The properties of membranes also change with temperature. These thermal effects dramatically influence animal function and performance. For example, because the power and speed of muscle contraction is strongly temperature dependent, a body temperature change of only a few degrees may have a very large impact on an animal's ability to run, jump, or fly.

Although different species of animals are adapted to different environmental temperatures, each animal has an optimal temperature range. Within that range, many animals maintain a nearly constant internal temperature as the external temperature fluctuates. This thermoregulation helps keep body temperature within a range that enables cells to function most effectively. An animal that thermoregulates balances its heat budget over time in such a way that the rate of heat gain exactly matches the rate of heat loss. Therefore, to understand thermoregulation, we first need to consider the ways heat is exchanged between animals and their environments.





WATER BALANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL

 

 Water balance and waste disposal depend on transport epithelia



 

 An animal's nitrogenous wastes are correlated with its phylogeny and habitat



 

 Cells require a balance between osmotic gain and loss of water



 

 Osmoregulators expend energy to control their internal osmolarity; osmoconformers are isoosmotic with their surroundings



Just as thermoregulation depends on balancing heat loss and gain, an animal's ability to regulate the chemical composition of its body fluids depends on balancing the uptake and loss of water and solutes. This osmoregulation (management of the body's water content and solute composition) is largely based on controlled movements of solutes between internal fluids and the external environment. This also regulates the movement of water, which follows solutes by osmosis. Animals must also remove various metabolic waste products before they accumulate to harmful levels.

The ultimate function of osmoregulation is to maintain the composition of the cytoplasm of the body's cells, but most animals do this indirectly by managing the composition of an internal body fluid that bathes the cells. In insects and other animals with an open circulatory system, this fluid is the hemolymph (see Chapter 42). In vertebrates and other animals with a closed circulatory system, the cells are bathed in an interstitial fluid. The composition of interstitial fluid is controlled indirectly by managing the composition of blood. Animals often have complex organs, such as the kidneys of vertebrates, that are specialized for the maintenance of fluid composition.





EXCRETORY SYSTEMS

 Diverse adaptations of the vertebrate kidney have evolved in different habitats



 

 Interacting regulatory systems maintain homeostasis



Although the problems of water balance on land or in salt water or fresh water are very different, their solutions all depend on the regulation of solute movement between internal fluids and the external environment. Much of this is handled by excretory systems, which are central to homeostasis because they dispose of metabolic wastes and control body fluid composition by adjusting the rates of loss of particular solutes.





 Regulating and conforming are the two extremes in how animals cope with environmental fluctuations

An animal is said to be a regulator for a particular environmental variable if it uses mechanisms of homeostasis to moderate internal change in the face of external fluctuation. For example, endothermic animals such as mammals and birds are thermoregulators, meaning they keep body temperature within narrow limits in spite of changes in environmental temperature. Let's consider another example. Pacific salmon spend part of their lives in salt water and part in fresh water. Throughout this change in "osmotic environment," a salmon uses mechanisms of osmoregulation to maintain a constant concentration of solutes in its blood and interstitial fluid.

In contrast to such regulators, many other animals, especially those that live in relatively stable environments, are conformers in their relationship to certain environmental changes. Such conformers allow some conditions within their bodies to vary with certain external changes (FIGURE 44.1a). Many marine invertebrates, such as spider crabs of the genus Libinia, live in environments where the salinity is relatively stable. These organisms do not osmoregulate, and if placed in water of varying salinity, they will lose or gain water to conform to the external environment even when this internal adjustment is extreme enough to cause death (FIGURE 44.1b).

Fig 44-1. Regulators and conformers.

Conforming and regulating represent extremes on a continuum, and no organisms are perfect regulators or conformers. For example, the salmon previously described can osmoregulate, but they conform to external temperatures.

Even for a particular environmental variable, a species may conform in one situation and regulate in another. Regulation requires the expenditure of energy, and in some environments the cost of regulation may outweigh the benefits of homeostasis. For example, temperature regulation would require the forest-dwelling lizard Anolis cristatellus to travel long distances (and risk capture by a predator) to find an exposed sunny perch. (Reptiles are ectotherms, but can regulate body temperature by moving to a location of favorable temperature.) The lizard is therefore likely to survive longer and produce more offspring by allowing its body temperature to conform to that of the forest environment. However, this same species uses a behavioral adaptation to thermoregulate in open habitats; the lizard seeks patches of sun where it can bask.





 Homeostasis balances an animal's gains versus losses for energy and materials

Like all organisms, animals are open systems that must exchange energy and materials with their environments: Food must be eaten to provide nutrients and chemical energy, oxygen is needed for cellular respiration, CO2 and other metabolic wastes must be removed, heat and water are exchanged, and so forth. These inward and outward flows of energy and materials are frequently rapid and often variable, but as they occur animals also need to maintain reasonably constant internal conditions. This means that rates of gain and loss must be closely matched over time; if they are not, life-threatening imbalances will eventually result. Normally, an animal's inputs of energy and materials only exceed its outputs when there is a net increase in organic matter due to growth or reproduction.

Consider some of the exchanges that occur during ten years in the life of a typical woman weighing 60 kg (shown symbolically in FIGURE 44.2). During that decade she will eat about 2 tons of food, drink 6 to 10 tons of water, use almost 2 tons of oxygen, and metabolically generate more than 7 million kilocalories of heat (enough to warm 90 tons of water from room temperature to the boiling point). The same quantity of materials and heat must be lost from the woman's body in order to maintain its size, temperature, and chemical composition.

Fig 44-2. A partial energy and material bookkeeping for ten years in the life of a young woman. The accounting here is incomplete. For example, uptake of material in the form of food and O2 must be balanced by the loss of material as wastes such as CO2 and organic wastes in feces and urine.

If the woman produces two children (and breast-feeds each for two years) during this ten-year span, she will need to increase the total flow of energy and materials by only 4-5%  compared to her basic maintenance needs. Reproduction is a larger part of the energy and materials flow in many other species--for example, 10-15%  of the annual energy requirement in female mice rearing two litters per year--but regardless of reproductive costs, every animal's survival depends on accurate control of materials and energy exchange.

Because homeostasis requires such a careful balance of materials and energy, it can be viewed as a set of budgets of gains and losses (a heat budget, an energy budget, a water budget, and so on). Most energy and materials budgets are interconnected, with changes in the flux of one component affecting the exchanges of other components. For example, when terrestrial animals exchange gases with the air by breathing, they also lose water by evaporation from the moist lung surfaces. That loss must be compensated by intake (in food or drink) of an equal amount of water. Also, evaporation removes heat from the body (see FIGURE 3.4), and that heat loss must be balanced by the gain of an equivalent amount of heat from some other source.

Let us now see how mechanisms of homeostasis balance an animal's energy and materials budgets, beginning with thermoregulation.





 Four physical processes account for heat gain or loss

An organism, like any object, exchanges heat by four physical processes called conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation (FIGURE 44.3). These processes account for the flow of heat within an organism and between an organism and its external environment.

Fig 44-3. Heat exchange between an organism and its environment. Heat is conducted from an object of higher temperature to one of lower temperature.

Conduction is the direct transfer of thermal motion (heat) between molecules of objects in direct contact with each other, as when an animal sits in a pool of cold water or on a hot rock. Heat is always conducted from an object of higher temperature to one of lower temperature, but the rate and amount of heat transfer varies with different materials. Water is 50 to 100 times more effective than air in conducting heat. This is one reason you can rapidly cool your body on a hot day just by standing in cold water.

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of air or liquid past a surface, as when a breeze contributes to heat loss from the surface of an animal with dry skin, or circulating blood moves heat from an animal's warm body core to the cooler extremities such as legs. The familiar "wind-chill factor" is an example of how convection compounds the harshness of low temperatures by increasing the rate of heat transfer.

Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves by all objects warmer than absolute zero, including an animal's body, the environment, and the sun. Radiation can transfer heat between objects that are not in direct contact, as when an animal absorbs heat radiating from the sun.

Evaporation is the removal of heat from the surface of a liquid that is losing some of its molecules as gas. Evaporation of water from an animal has a strong cooling effect, but it can only occur if the surrounding air is not saturated with water molecules (that is, if the relative humidity is less than 100% ). This is the basis for the common complaint, "The heat is not as bad as the humidity."





 Ectotherms have body temperatures close to environmental temperature; endotherms can use metabolic heat to keep body temperature warmer than their surroundings

Although all animals exchange heat through some combination of conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation, there are important differences in how various species manage their heat budgets. One way to classify the thermal characteristics of animals is to emphasize the role of metabolic heat in determining body temperature. An ectotherm has such a low metabolic rate that the amount of heat it generates is too small to have much effect on body temperature. Consequently, ectotherm body temperatures are almost entirely determined by the temperature of the surrounding environment. Most invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, and reptiles are ectotherms. In contrast, an endotherm's high metabolic rate generates enough heat to keep its body substantially warmer than the environment. Mammals, birds, some fishes, a few reptiles, and numerous insect species are endotherms.

Many endotherms, including humans, maintain high and very stable internal temperature even as the temperature of their surroundings fluctuates (FIGURE 44.4). However, it is not constant body temperature that distinguishes endotherms from ectotherms. For example, many ectothermic marine fishes and invertebrates inhabit water with such stable temperatures that their body temperature varies less than that of humans and other endotherms. Also, many endotherms sustain high body temperatures only part of the time (for example, while they are active). And not all ectotherms have low body temperatures: When sitting in the sun, many ectothermic lizards have higher body temperatures than mammals. Therefore, most biologists do not use the familiar terms cold-blooded and warm-blooded because they are frequently misleading.

Endothermy has several important advantages. High and stable body temperature, along with other biochemical and physiological adaptations associated with endothermy (such as elaborate circulatory and respiratory systems), give these animals very high levels of aerobic metabolism (cellular respiration). This allows endotherms to perform vigorous activity for much longer than is possible for ectotherms (see FIGURE 40.13). Sustained intense activity, such as long-distance running or powered (flapping) flight, is usually only feasible for animals with an endothermic way of life. Endothermy also solves certain thermal problems of living on land, enabling terrestrial animals to maintain stable body temperature in the face of environmental temperature fluctuations that are generally more severe than in aquatic habitats. For example, no ectotherm can be active in the below-freezing weather that prevails during winter over much of Earth's surface, but many endotherms function very well in these conditions. Most of the time, endothermic vertebrates--birds and mammals--are warmer than their surroundings, but these animals also have mechanisms for cooling the body in a hot environment, and this enables them to withstand heat loads that are intolerable for most ectotherms.

Being endothermic is liberating, but it is also energetically expensive, especially in a cold environment. For example, at 20&#176;C, a human at rest has a metabolic rate of 1,300 to 1,800 kcal per day (see Chapter 40). In contrast, a resting ectotherm of similar weight, such as an American alligator, has a metabolic rate of only about 60 kcal per day at 20&#176;C. Thus, endotherms generally need to consume much more food than ectotherms of equivalent size--a serious disadvantage for endotherms if food supplies are limited. For this and other reasons, ectothermy is an extremely effective and successful "strategy" in many terrestrial environments, as shown by the abundance and diversity of ectothermic insects, spiders, amphibians, and reptiles.





 Thermoregulation involves physiological and behavioral adjustments that balance heat gain and loss

For endotherms and for those ectotherms that thermoregulate, the essence of thermoregulation is management of the heat budget so that rates of heat gain are equal to rates of heat loss. If the heat budget gets out of balance, the animal will either become warmer or colder. Four general categories of adaptations help animals thermoregulate:

Adjusting the rate of heat exchange between the animal and its surroundings. Insulation, such as hair, feathers, and fat located just beneath the skin, reduces the flow of heat between an animal and its environment. Other mechanisms that regulate rates of heat exchange usually involve adaptations of the circulatory system. Many endotherms and some ectotherms can alter the amount of blood (and hence heat) flowing between the body core and the skin. Elevated blood flow in the skin normally results from vasodilation, an increase in the diameter of superficial blood vessels (those near the body surface) triggered by nerve signals that relax the muscles of the vessel walls. In endotherms, vasodilation usually warms the skin, increasing the transfer of body heat to a cool environment by radiation, conduction, and convection (see FIGURE 44.3). The reverse process, vasoconstriction, reduces blood flow and heat transfer by decreasing the diameter of superficial vessels.

Another circulatory adaptation is a special arrangement of blood vessels called a countercurrent heat exchanger that helps trap heat in the body core and is important in reducing heat loss in many endotherms (FIGURE 44.5). For example, marine mammals and many birds face the problem of losing large amounts of heat from their extremities, which are often immersed in cold water or in contact with ice or snow. Arteries carrying warm blood down the legs of a bird or the flippers of a dolphin are in close contact with veins conveying cool blood in the opposite direction, back toward the trunk of the body. This countercurrent arrangement facilitates heat transfer from arteries to veins along the entire length of the blood vessels. Near the end of the leg or flipper, where arterial blood has been cooled to far below the animal's core temperature, the artery can still transfer heat to the even colder blood of an adjacent vein (recall that heat moves from a warmer object to a cooler one). The venous blood can continue to absorb heat because it is passing warmer and warmer arterial blood traveling in the opposite direction. As the venous blood approaches the center of the body, it is almost as warm as the body core, minimizing the heat lost as a result of supplying blood to body parts immersed in cold water. In essence, heat in the arterial blood emerging from the body core is transferred directly to the returning venous blood, instead of being lost to the environment. In some species, blood can either go through the heat exchanger or bypass it in other blood vessels. The relative amount of blood that flows through the two different paths varies, adjusting the rate of heat loss as an animal's physiological state or environment changes.

Fig 44-5. Countercurrent heat exchangers. (a) Many birds, such as this Canada goose, have countercurrent systems in their legs that reduce heat loss. The arteries carrying blood down the legs contact the veins that return blood to the body core. In a cold environment, the heat in warm arterial blood is transferred (black arrows) to venous blood returning to the body, instead of being lost to the environment. (b) In the flippers of marine mammals, such as this Pacific bottlenose dolphin, each artery is surrounded by several veins in a countercurrent arrangement that allows efficient heat exchange between arterial and venous blood.

Circulatory adaptations that reduce heat loss enable some endotherms to survive the most extreme winter conditions. For example, take another look at the arctic wolf in the photo on page 925. Wolves remain active in very cold weather. Thick fur coats help keep their bodies warm. Countercurrent heat exchangers keep a wolf's legs from freezing. But what mechanism restricts heat loss from the hairless, fleshy foot and toe pads, which lack insulation and are in contact with extremely cold snow or ice? By adjusting blood flow through the countercurrent exchangers and other vessels in the legs, wolves can keep their foot temperature just above 0&#176;C in freezing weather--cool enough to reduce heat loss but warm enough to prevent frostbite--even in environmental temperatures as low as -50&#176;C. If necessary, wolves can warm their feet to much higher temperatures--for example, if they need to lose the large quantities of metabolic heat produced during long-distance running.

Cooling by evaporative heat loss. Terrestrial animals lose water by evaporation across the skin and when they breathe. Water absorbs considerable heat when it evaporates, and some animals have adaptations that can greatly augment this cooling effect. For example, most mammals and birds can increase evaporation from the lungs by panting. Sweating or bathing to make the skin wet also enhances evaporative cooling (see FIGURE 3.4).

Behavioral responses. Both endotherms and ectotherms use behavioral responses, such as changes in posture or moving about in their environment, to control body temperature. Many terrestrial animals will bask in the sun or on warm rocks when cold or find cool, shaded, or damp areas when hot. Many ectotherms can maintain a very constant body temperature by these simple behaviors. More extreme behavioral adaptations in some animals include hibernation or migration to a more suitable climate.

Changing the rate of metabolic heat production. This fourth category of thermoregulatory adaptation applies only to endotherms, particularly mammals and birds. By means we will discuss in the next section, many species of mammals and birds can greatly increase their metabolic heat production when exposed to cold.





 Most animals are ectothermic, but endothermy is widespread

In this section we survey several large taxa of animals, concentrating on the mechanisms by which they thermoregulate as ectotherms or endotherms.

Mammals and Birds

Mammals and birds generally maintain body temperatures within a narrow range (36-38&#176;C for most mammals and 39-42&#176;C for most birds) that is usually considerably warmer than the environment. Because heat always flows from a warm object to cooler surroundings, birds and mammals must counteract the constant heat loss. This maintenance of warm body temperature depends on several key adaptations. The most basic mechanism is the high metabolic rate of endothermy itself. Endotherms can produce large amounts of metabolic heat that replace the flow of heat to the environment, and they can vary heat production to match changing rates of heat loss. Heat production is increased by such muscle activity as moving or shivering. In some mammals, certain hormones can cause mitochondria to increase their metabolic activity and produce heat instead of ATP. This nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) takes place throughout the body, but some mammals also have a tissue called brown fat in the neck and between the shoulders that is specialized for rapid heat production. Through shivering and NST, mammals and birds in cold environments can increase their metabolic heat production by as much as 5 to 10 times above the minimal levels that occur in warm conditions.

Another major thermoregulatory adaptation that evolved in mammals and birds is insulation (hair, feathers, and fat layers), which reduces the flow of heat and lowers the energy cost of keeping warm. The insulating power of a layer of fur or feathers mainly depends on how much still air the layer traps. Most land mammals and birds react to cold by raising their fur or feathers, thereby trapping a thicker layer of air. Humans rely more on a layer of fat just beneath the skin as insulation (FIGURE 44.6); goose bumps are a vestige of hair-raising left over from our furry ancestors.

Fig 44-6. Skin as an organ of thermoregulation. Fat (adipose tissue) and hair help insulate mammals. Heat loss to the environment can be regulated by the constriction and dilation of superficial blood vessels and by the erection and compaction of fur. Sweat glands, under nervous control, function in evaporative cooling.

Vasodilation and vasoconstriction also regulate heat exchange and may contribute to regional temperature differences within the animal. For example, heat loss from a human is reduced when arms and legs cool to several degrees below the temperature of the body core, where most vital organs are located.

Hair loses most of its insulating power when wet. Marine mammals such as whales and seals have a very thick layer of insulating fat called blubber, just under the skin. Marine mammals swim in water colder than their body core temperature, and many species spend at least part of the year in nearly freezing polar seas. The loss of heat to water occurs 50 to 100 times more rapidly than heat loss to air, and the skin temperature of a marine mammal is close to water temperature. Even so, the blubber insulation is so effective that marine mammals maintain body core temperatures of about 36-38&#176;C with metabolic rates about the same as those of land mammals of similar size. The flippers or tail of a whale or seal lack insulating blubber, but as we discussed, countercurrent heat exchangers greatly reduce heat loss in these extremities, as they do in the legs of many birds (see FIGURE 44.5).

Through metabolic heat production, insulation, and vascular adjustments, birds and mammals are capable of astonishing feats of thermoregulation. For example, small birds called chickadees, which weigh only 20 grams, can remain active and hold body temperature nearly constant at 40&#176;C in environmental temperatures as low as -40&#176;C--as long as they have enough food to supply the large amount of energy necessary for heat production.

Many mammals and birds live in places where thermoregulation requires cooling as well as warming. For example, when a marine mammal moves into warm seas, as many whales do when they reproduce, excess metabolic heat is removed by vasodilation of numerous blood vessels in the outer layer of the skin. In hot climates or when vigorous exercise adds large amounts of metabolic heat to the body, many terrestrial mammals and birds may allow body temperature to rise by several degrees, which enhances heat loss by increasing the temperature gradient between the body and a warm environment. Evaporative cooling often plays a key role in dissipating the body heat (FIGURE 44.7). If environmental temperature is above body temperature, animals gain heat from the environment as well as from metabolism, and evaporation is the only way to keep body temperature from rising rapidly. Panting is important in birds and many mammals. Some birds have a pouch richly supplied with blood vessels in the floor of the mouth; fluttering the pouch increases evaporation. Pigeons can use evaporative cooling to keep body temperature close to 40&#176;C in air temperatures as high as 60&#176;C, as long as they have sufficient water. Many terrestrial mammals have sweat glands controlled by the nervous system (see FIGURE 44.6). Other mechanisms that promote evaporative cooling include spreading saliva on body surfaces, an adaptation of some kangaroos and rodents for combating severe heat stress. Some bats use both saliva and urine to enhance evaporative cooling.

Amphibians and Reptiles

All amphibians and most reptiles are ectothermic, and their low metabolic rates have little influence on normal body temperature. The optimal temperature range for amphibians varies substantially with the species. For example, closely related species of salamanders have average body temperatures ranging from 7&#176; to 25&#176;C. When exposed to air, most amphibians lose heat rapidly by evaporation from their moist body surfaces, making it difficult to keep body temperature sufficiently warm. However, behavioral adaptations help these animals maintain a satisfactory temperature most of the time--by moving to a location where solar heat is available, for instance. When the surroundings are too warm, amphibians seek cooler microenvironments, such as shaded areas. Some species, such as bullfrogs, can vary the amount of mucus they secrete from their surface, a response that regulates evaporative cooling.

Like amphibians, reptiles control body temperature mainly by behavior. When cold, they seek warm places, orienting themselves toward heat sources to increase heat uptake and expanding the body surface exposed to a heat source. When hot, they move to cool areas or turn in another direction, thereby reducing the surface area exposed to the sun. Many reptiles keep their body temperatures very stable over the course of a day by shuttling back and forth between warm and cool spots.

Some reptiles also have physiological adaptations that regulate heat loss. For example, in the marine iguana, which inhabits the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, body heat is conserved by vaso-constriction of superficial blood vessels, routing more blood to the central core of the body when the animal is swimming in the cold ocean. A few large reptiles become endothermic in special circumstances. For example, female pythons that are incubating eggs increase their metabolic rate by shivering, generating enough heat to keep their body (and egg) temperatures 5-7&#176;C warmer than the surrounding air for weeks at a time. This temporary endothermy consumes considerable energy. Researchers continue to debate whether certain groups of dinosaurs were endothermic (see Chapter 34).

Fishes

In terms of body temperature, most fishes are conformers, with internal temperature usually within 1-2&#176;C of the surrounding water temperature. The swimming muscles may be large and active, but nearly all the metabolic heat most fishes generate is lost to the surrounding water when blood passes through the gills. However, some specialized endothermic fishes, mainly large, powerful swimmers such as the bluefin tuna, swordfish, and the great white shark, have circulatory adaptations that retain metabolic heat in the body. Large arteries convey most of the cold blood from the gills to tissues just under the skin. Branches deliver blood to the deep muscles, where the small vessels are arranged into a countercurrent heat exchanger. Endothermy enhances the vigorous, sustained activity that is characteristic of these fishes by keeping the main swimming muscles several degrees warmer than the tissues near the animal's surface, about the same temperature as the surrounding water (FIGURE 44.8). In a few fish species, special heat-generating organs, which may be evolutionarily derived from eye muscles, warm just the eyes or brain. These adaptations probably allow more effective functioning of the warmed organs.

Fig 44-8. Thermoregulation in large, active fishes. (a) Unlike most fishes, the bluefin tuna maintains temperatures in its main swimming muscles that are much higher than the surrounding water (colors indicate swimming muscles cut in transverse section). These temperatures were recorded for a tuna in 19&#176;C water. (b) Like the bluefin tuna, the great white shark has a countercurrent heat exchanger in its swimming muscles that reduces the loss of metabolic heat. (The photo shows a great white leaping out of the water in pursuit of a decoy model seal.) All fishes lose heat to the surrounding water when their blood passes through the gills. How-ever, endothermic fishes have a small dorsal aorta, and as a result relatively little cold blood from the gills goes directly to the core of the body. Instead, most of the blood leaving the gills is conveyed via large arteries just under the skin, keeping cool blood away from the body core. As shown in the enlargement, small arteries carrying cool blood inward from the large arteries under the skin are paralleled by small veins carrying warm blood outward from the inner body. This countercurrent flow retains heat in the muscles.

Invertebrates

Aquatic invertebrates are mainly thermoconformers with little control over their body temperature. However, many terrestrial invertebrates can adjust internal temperature by the same behavioral mechanisms used by vertebrate ectotherms such as lizards. The desert locust, for example, must reach a certain temperature to become active, and on cold days it orients in a direction that maximizes the absorption of sunlight.

Many species of flying insects, such as bees and moths, are actually endothermic--the smallest of all endotherms. The hawk moth is an example. The capacity of such endothermic insects to elevate body temperature depends on powerful flight muscles, which generate large amounts of heat when operating. Many endothermic insects use shivering--by contracting the flight muscles in synchrony, so that only slight wing movements occur but considerable heat is produced--to warm up before taking off. Chemical reactions, and hence cellular respiration, speed up in the warmed-up flight "motors" (the Q10 effect), enabling these insects to fly even on cold days or at night (FIGURE 44.9a). Many endothermic insects (bumblebees, honeybees, and some moths) have a countercurrent heat exchanger that helps maintain a high temperature in the thorax, where the flight muscles are located. For example, the heat exchanger keeps the thorax of certain moths at about 30&#176;C during flight, even on cold, snowy nights (FIGURE 44.9b). In contrast, insects flying in hot weather run the risk of overheating because of the large amount of heat produced by working flight muscles. In some species the countercurrent mechanism can be shut down to allow muscle-produced heat to be lost from the thorax to the abdomen, and from there to the environment. Bumblebee queens use this means to incubate their eggs: They generate heat by shivering their flight muscles and then transfer the heat to the abdomen, which the bee presses against her eggs.

Fig 44-9. Thermoregulation in moths.

Honeybees use an additional thermoregulatory mechanism that depends on social behavior. In cold weather they increase heat production and huddle together, thereby retaining heat. They maintain a relatively constant temperature by changing the density of the huddling. Individuals move between the cooler outer edges of the cluster and the warmer center, thus circulating and distributing the heat. Even when huddling, honeybees must expend considerable energy to keep warm during long periods of cold weather, and this is the main function of storing large quantities of fuel in the hive in the form of honey. Honeybees also control the temperature of their hive by transporting water to it in hot weather and fanning with their wings, which promotes evaporation and convection. Thus, a honeybee colony uses many of the mechanisms of thermoregulation seen in single organisms.

Feedback Mechanisms in Thermoregulation

The regulation of body temperature in humans and other mammals is a complex system facilitated by feedback mechanisms (see FIGURE 40.9). Nerve cells that control thermoregulation, as well as those that control many other aspects of homeostasis, are concentrated in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus (discussed in detail in Chapter 48). The hypothalamus contains a group of neurons that functions as a thermostat, responding to changes in body temperature above and below a set point (actually above or below a normal range) by activating mechanisms that promote heat loss or gain (FIGURE 44.10, p. 934). Nerve cells that sense temperatures are in the skin, the hypothalamus itself, and several other body regions. Warm receptors signal the hypothalamic thermostat when temperatures increase; cold receptors indicate temperature decrease. At body temperature below the normal range, the thermostat inhibits heat-loss mechanisms and activates heat-saving ones such as vasoconstriction of superficial vessels and erection of fur, while stimulating heat-generating mechanisms (shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis). In response to elevated body temperature, the thermostat shuts down heat-retention mechanisms and promotes body cooling by vasodilation, sweating, or panting. The thermostat can also respond to external temperature (sensed as skin temperature) even without changes in body core temperature.

Adjustment to Changing Temperatures

Many animals can adjust to a new range of environmental temperatures over a period of days or weeks, a physiological response called acclimatization. Both ectotherms and endotherms acclimatize, but in different ways. In birds and mammals, acclimatization often includes adjusting the amount of insulation--by growing a thicker coat of fur in the winter and shedding it in the summer, for example--and sometimes varying the capacity for metabolic heat production in different seasons. These changes help endotherms keep a constant body temperature in both warm and cold seasons. In contrast, acclimatization in ectotherms is a process of compensating for changes in body temperature. These adjustments can strongly affect physiology and temperature tolerance. For example, summer-acclimatized bullhead catfish can survive water temperatures up to 36&#176;C but cannot function in cold water; after winter acclimatization they can easily tolerate cold water, but a temperature above 28&#176;C is lethal.

Acclimatization responses in ectotherms often include adjustments at the cellular level. Cells may increase the production of certain enzymes, helping to compensate for the lowered activity of each enzyme molecule at temperatures that are not optimal. In other cases, cells produce variants of enzymes that have the same function but different temperature optima. Membranes may also change the proportions of saturated and unsaturated lipids they contain, which helps keep membranes fluid at different temperatures (see FIGURE 8.4).

Some ectotherms that experience subzero body temperatures protect themselves by producing "antifreeze" compounds (cryoprotectants) that prevent ice formation in the cells. In arctic regions or cold mountain peaks, cryoprotectants in the body fluids let overwintering ectotherms, such as some frogs and many arthropods and their eggs, withstand body temperatures considerably below zero. Cryoprotectants are also found in certain species of fishes from arctic and antarctic seas, where water temperatures can be as cold as -1.8&#176;C, well below the freezing point of unprotected body fluids (about -0.7&#176;C).

Cells can often make rapid adjustments to temperature changes. For example, mammalian cells grown in laboratory cultures respond to a marked increase in temperature and to other forms of severe stress, such as toxins, rapid pH changes, and viral infections, by accumulating special molecules called stress-induced proteins, including heat-shock proteins. When "shocked" by a rapid change in temperature from 37&#176;C to about 43&#176;C, cultured mammalian cells begin synthesizing heat-shock proteins within minutes. These molecules help maintain the integrity of other proteins that would be denatured by severe heat. Found in bacteria, yeasts, and plant cells as well as in animals, stress-induced proteins help prevent cell death when an organism is challenged by severe changes in the cellular environment.





 Torpor conserves energy during environmental extremes

Despite their many adaptations for homeostasis, animals may periodically encounter conditions that severely challenge their abilities to balance heat, energy, and materials budgets. For example, at certain seasons of the year (or certain times of day) temperatures may be extremely hot or cold, or food may be unavailable. One way animals can save energy while avoiding difficult and dangerous conditions is to use torpor, a physiological state in which activity is low and metabolism decreases.

Hibernation is long-term torpor that evolved as an adaptation to winter cold and food scarcity. When vertebrate endotherms (birds and mammals) enter torpor or hibernation, their body temperatures decline--in effect, their body's thermostat is turned down. The temperature reduction may be dramatic: Some hibernating mammals cool to as low as 1-2&#176;C, and a few even drop slightly below 0&#176;C in a supercooled (unfrozen) state. The resulting energy savings due to lower metabolic rate and less heat production are huge; metabolic rates during hibernation can be several hundred times lower than if the animal attempted to maintain normal body temperatures of 36-38&#176;C. This allows hibernators to survive for very long periods on limited supplies of energy, stored in the body tissues or as food cached in a burrow. For example, hibernation can take up as much as nine months of the year in some small mammals, leaving only three months for normal activity.

Certain ground squirrels are favorite research models for biologists interested in the physiology of hibernation. A Belding's ground squirrel living in the high mountains of California is active only during spring and summer, when it maintains a body temperature of about 37&#176;C and a metabolic rate of about 85 kcal per day (FIGURE 44.11). In September the squirrel retreats to a safe burrow where it spends the next eight months hibernating. For most of the hibernation season, the squirrel's body temperature is only slightly above burrow temperature (which may be close to freezing), and its metabolic rate is extremely low. Every week or two it arouses for a few hours, using metabolic heat to warm up to about 37&#176;C (these periodic arousals may be needed for maintenance functions that require high body temperature). In late spring, when outside temperature is climbing, the squirrel resumes normal endothermy. By hibernating, Belding's ground squirrels avoid severe cold and greatly reduce the amount of energy they need to survive the winter, when their normal food of grasses and seeds is not available. Instead of having to spend 150 kcal per day to maintain normal body temperatures in winter weather, a squirrel in its burrow spends an average of only 5-8 kcal per day (only about 1 kcal per day when hibernating) and can live on stored fat--without eating--for the entire hibernation season.

Estivation, or summer torpor, also characterized by slow metabolism and inactivity, enables animals to survive long periods of high temperatures and scarce water supplies. Hibernation and estivation are often triggered by seasonal changes in the length of daylight. As the days shorten, some hibernators prepare for winter by storing food in their burrows; other species eat huge quantities of food and fatten dramatically. For example, ground squirrels double their weight in a month of gorging.

Many small mammals and birds exhibit a daily torpor that seems to be adapted to their feeding patterns. For instance, most bats and shrews feed at night and go into torpor when they are inactive during daylight hours. Chickadees and hummingbirds feed during the day and often undergo torpor on cold nights; the body temperature of chickadees drops as much as 10&#176;C at night, and that of hummingbirds can fall 25-30&#176;C. All endotherms that use daily torpor are relatively small; when active they have high metabolic rates and thus very high rates of energy consumption. During hours when they cannot feed, torpor enables them to survive on stored energy.

An animal's daily cycle of activity and torpor appears to be a built-in rhythm controlled by the biological clock (see Chapter 48). Even if food is made available to a shrew all day, it still goes through its daily torpor. The need for sleep in humans and the slight drop in body temperature that accompanies it may be an evolutionary remnant of a more pronounced daily torpor in our early mammalian ancestors.





 Water balance and waste disposal depend on transport epithelia

In most animals, one or more kinds of transport epithelium--a layer or layers of specialized epithelial cells that regulate solute movements--are essential components of osmotic regulation and metabolic waste disposal. The most important feature of all transport epithelia is their ability to move specific solutes in controlled amounts in particular directions. Some transport epithelia directly face the outside environment, while others line channels connected to the outside by an opening on the body surface. Joined by impermeable tight junctions (see FIGURE 7.30), the cells of the epithelium form a barrier at the tissue-environment boundary. Like the Casparian strip in plant roots (see FIGURE 36.7), this arrangement ensures that any solutes moving between animal and environment must pass through selectively permeable membranes.

In most animals, transport epithelia are arranged into complex tubular networks with extensive surface areas. We find some of the best examples in the salt glands of marine birds, which spend months or years at sea and need to obtain both food and water from the ocean (FIGURE 44.12).

Fig 44-12. Salt-excreting glands in birds. (a) Many marine birds, such as this albatross, can survive long periods at sea by drinking seawater. They can do this because they have a pair of nasal glands that secrete an excretory fluid much more salty than the ocean. Thus, even though drinking seawater brings in a lot of salt, the bird achieves a net gain of water (in contrast, humans who drink seawater must use more water to excrete the salt load than was gained by drinking). A seabird's salt glands empty via a duct into the nostrils, and the salty solution either drips off the tip of the beak or is exhaled in a fine mist. (b) This diagram shows one of several thousand secretory tubules in a salt-excreting gland. Each tubule is lined by a transport epithelium surrounded by capillaries, and drains into a central duct. (c) The secretory cells of the transport epithelium actively transport salt from the blood into the tubules. Notice that blood flows counter to the flow of salt secretion. By maintaining a concentration gradient of salt in the tubule (graded blue shading), this countercurrent system enhances salt transfer from the blood to the lumen of the tubule (see Chapter 42).

The molecular structure of plasma membranes determines the kinds and directions of solutes that move across transport epithelia. For example, salt-excreting glands remove excess sodium chloride from the blood. By contrast, transport epithelia in the gills of freshwater fishes move salts from the dilute surrounding water into the blood (this kind of solute movement--against a concentration gradient--requires the expenditure of ATP in active transport). Transport epithelia in excretory organs often have the dual functions of maintaining water balance and disposing of metabolic wastes.





 An animal's nitrogenous wastes are correlated with its phylogeny and habitat

Because most metabolic wastes must be dissolved in water when they are removed from the body (a major exception being loss of carbon dioxide in air-breathing animals), the type and quantity of waste products may have a large impact on water balance. In terms of their effect on osmoregulation, among the most important wastes are the nitrogenous (nitrogen-containing) breakdown products of proteins and nucleic acids. When these macromolecules are broken apart for energy or converted to carbohydrates or fats, enzymes remove nitrogen in the form of ammonia, a small and very toxic molecule. Some animals excrete ammonia directly, but many species first convert it to compounds such as urea or uric acid, which are less toxic but require energy in the form of ATP to produce.

In general, the kinds of nitrogenous wastes excreted depend on an animal's evolutionary history and habitat--especially the availability of water (FIGURE 44.13, p. 938). The amount of nitrogenous waste produced is coupled to the energy budget, as it strongly depends on how much and what kind of food an animal eats. Because they use energy at high rates, endotherms eat more food--and therefore produce more nitrogenous wastes--than ectotherms. Predators, which derive much of their energy from dietary proteins, need to excrete more nitrogen than animals that rely mainly on lipids or carbohydrates as energy sources.

Fig 44-13. Nitrogenous wastes.

Ammonia

Because ammonia is very soluble but can only be tolerated at very low concentrations, animals that excrete nitrogenous wastes as ammonia need access to lots of water. Therefore, ammonia excretion is most common in aquatic species. Ammonia molecules easily pass through membranes and are readily lost by diffusion to the surrounding water. In many invertebrates, ammonia release occurs across the whole body surface. In fishes, most of the ammonia is lost as ammonium ions (NH4+) across the epithelium of the gills, with kidneys excreting only minor amounts of nitrogenous wastes. In freshwater fishes, the gill epithelium takes up Na+ from the water in exchange for NH4+, which helps to maintain a much higher Na+ concentration in body fluids than in the surrounding water.

Urea

Although it works well in many aquatic species, ammonia excretion is much less suitable for land animals. Because it is so toxic, ammonia can only be transported and excreted in large volumes of very dilute solutions, and most terrestrial animals and many marine species (which tend to lose water to their environment by osmosis) simply do not have access to sufficient water. Instead, mammals, most adult amphibians, and many marine fishes and turtles excrete mainly urea, a substance produced in the vertebrate liver by a metabolic cycle that combines ammonia with carbon dioxide. The circulatory system carries urea to the excretory organs, the kidneys.

The main advantage of urea is its low toxicity, about 100,000 times less than that of ammonia. This permits animals to transport and store urea safely at high concentrations. And this greatly reduces the amount of water required for nitrogen excretion, because much less water is lost when a given quantity of nitrogen is excreted in a concentrated solution of urea rather than a dilute solution of ammonia.

The main disadvantage of urea is that animals must expend energy to produce it from ammonia. From a bioenergetic standpoint, we would predict that animals that spend part of their lives in water and part on land would switch between excreting ammonia (thereby saving energy) and urea (reducing excretory water loss). In fact, many amphibians excrete mainly ammonia when they are aquatic tadpoles and switch largely to urea when they are land-dwelling adults.

Uric Acid

Land snails, insects, birds, and many reptiles excrete uric acid as the major nitrogenous waste. Like urea, uric acid is relatively nontoxic. But unlike either ammonia or urea, uric acid is largely insoluble in water and can be excreted as a semisolid paste with very small water loss. This is a great advantage for animals with little access to water, but there is a cost: Uric acid is even more energetically expensive to produce than urea, requiring considerable ATP for synthesis from ammonia.

Uric acid and urea represent different adaptations for excreting nitrogenous wastes with minimal water loss. One factor that seems to have been important in determining which of these alternatives evolved in a particular group of animals is the mode of reproduction. Soluble wastes can diffuse out of a shell-less amphibian egg or be carried away by the mother's blood in a mammalian embryo. However, the shelled eggs produced by reptiles and birds are permeable to gases but not to liquids, which means soluble nitrogenous wastes released by an embryo would be trapped within the egg and could accumulate to dangerous levels (although urea is much less harmful than ammonia, it does become toxic at very high concentrations). In these animals natural selection apparently favored use of uric acid, which precipitates out of solution and can be stored within the egg as a harmless solid left behind when the animal hatches.

The type of nitrogenous waste produced by vertebrates depends on habitat as well as on evolutionary lineage. For example, terrestrial turtles (which often live in dry areas) excrete mainly uric acid, whereas aquatic turtles excrete both urea and ammonia. In some species, individuals can change their nitrogenous wastes when environmental conditions change. For example, certain tortoises that usually produce urea shift to uric acid production when temperature increases and water becomes less available. This is another example of how response to the environment occurs on two levels: Over generations, evolution determines the limits of physiological responses for a species, but during their lives individual organisms make adjustments within these evolutionary constraints.





 Cells require a balance between osmotic gain and loss of water

All animals--regardless of phylogeny, habitat, or type of nitrogenous waste--face the same central problem of osmoregulation: Over time, the rates of water uptake and loss must balance. Animal cells--which lack cell walls--swell and burst if there is a continuous net uptake of water or shrivel and die if there is a substantial net loss of water.

Water enters and leaves cells by osmosis. Recall from Chapter 8 that osmosis, a special case of diffusion, is the movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane. It occurs whenever two solutions separated by the membrane differ in osmotic pressure, or osmolarity (total solute concentration expressed as molarity, or moles of solute per liter of solution; see Chapter 3). The unit of measurement for osmolarity used in this chapter is milliosmoles per liter (mosm/L); 1 mosm/L is equivalent to a total solute concentration of 10-3M. The osmolarity of human blood is about 300 mosm/L, while seawater has an osmolarity of about 1,000 mosm/L. Two solutions separated by a selectively permeable membrane are said to be isoosmotic if they have the same osmolarity.

There is no net movement of water by osmosis between isoosmotic solutions (although water molecules are continually crossing the membrane, they do so at equal rates in both directions). When two solutions differ in osmolarity, the one with the greater concentration of solutes is referred to as hyperosmotic and the more dilute solution as hypoosmotic. Water flows by osmosis from a hypoosmotic solution to a hyperosmotic one.*





 Osmoregulators expend energy to control their internal osmolarity; osmoconformers are isoosmotic with their surroundings

There are two basic solutions to the problem of balancing water gain with water loss. One--available only to marine animals--is to be isoosmotic to the surroundings. Such an animal, which does not actively adjust its internal osmolarity, is known as an osmoconformer. Because an osmoconformer's internal osmolarity is the same as that of its environment, there is no tendency to gain or lose water. Although they do not compensate for changes in external osmolarity, osmoconformers often live in water that has a very stable composition and hence have a very constant internal osmolarity. In contrast, an osmoregulator is an animal that must control its internal osmolarity, because its body fluids are not isoosmotic with the outside environment. An osmoregulator must discharge excess water if it lives in a hypoosmotic environment or take in water to offset osmotic loss if it inhabits a hyperosmotic environment. Osmoregulation enables animals to live in environments that are uninhabitable for osmoconformers, such as freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and allows many marine animals to maintain internal osmolarities different from that of seawater.

Whenever animals maintain an osmolarity difference between the body and the external environment, osmoregulation has an energy cost. Because diffusion tends to equalize concentrations in a system, osmoregulators must expend energy to maintain the osmotic gradients that allow water to move in or out. They do so by using active transport to manipulate solute concentrations in their body fluids.

The energy cost of osmoregulation depends mainly on how different an animal's osmolarity is from its surroundings, how easily water and solutes can move across the animal's surface, and on how much membrane-transport work is required to pump solutes. Because of the difference in concentration between cytoplasm, fresh water (1-50 mosm/L), and seawater, osmoregulation accounts for nearly 5%  of the resting metabolic rate of many marine and freshwater bony fishes. For brine shrimp, small crustaceans that live in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and in other extremely salty lakes, the gradient between internal and external osmolarities is very large and the cost of osmoregulation is correspondingly high--as much as 30%  of the resting metabolic rate.

Most animals, whether osmoconformers or osmoregulators, cannot tolerate substantial changes in external osmolarity and are said to be stenohaline (Gr. stenos, "narrow"; haline refers to salt). In contrast, euryhaline animals (Gr. eurys, "broad")--which include both certain osmoconformers and certain osmoregulators--can survive large fluctuations of external osmolarity. Familiar examples of euryhaline osmoregulators are the various species of salmon. A more extreme example is a bony fish called tilapia (a native of Africa grown widely for human food), which can adjust to any salt concentration between fresh water and 2,000 mosm/L (twice that of seawater).

Next, we'll take a closer look at some of the adaptations for osmoregulation that have evolved in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial animals.

Maintaining Water Balance in the Sea

Animals first evolved in the sea, and more animal phyla are found there than in any other environment. Most marine invertebrates are osmoconformers, as are the hagfishes (jawless vertebrates). Their total osmolarity (the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved substances) is the same as seawater. However, they differ considerably from seawater in their concentrations of most specific solutes. Thus, even an animal that conforms to the osmolarity of its surroundings does regulate its internal composition.

Except for the hagfishes, marine vertebrates are osmoregulators. For most of these animals, the ocean is a strongly dehydrating environment because it is much saltier than internal fluids and water tends to be lost from the body by osmosis. Marine fishes (class Osteichthyes) constantly lose water through their skin and especially their gills (FIGURE 44.14a, p. 940). To balance these water losses, these fishes obtain water in food and by drinking large amounts of seawater. The accompanying salt intake (along with salt that enters the body by diffusion) is disposed of by active transport out of the gills. Very little urine is produced, an adaptation that conserves water.

Fig 44-14. Osmoregulation in marine and freshwater bony fishes: a comparison.

Marine sharks and most other cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes) use a different osmoregulatory "strategy." Like bony fishes, their internal salt concentration is much less than that of seawater, so in addition to salt intake in food, salt tends to diffuse into the body (especially across the gills). The kidneys of sharks remove some of this salt load, and the rest is excreted by an organ called the rectal gland or is lost in feces. Unlike bony fishes, and despite relatively low internal salt concentration, marine sharks do not experience a large and continuous osmotic water loss. The explanation is that sharks maintain high concentrations of urea in their body fluids, along with another organic solute, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), which protects proteins from damage by urea. (If you have ever prepared shark meat, you know it should be soaked in fresh water to remove urea before cooking.) The total solute concentration of body fluids (salts, urea, TMAO, and other compounds) is somewhat greater than 1,000 mosm/L and therefore slightly hyperosmotic to seawater. Consequently, water slowly enters the shark's body by osmosis and in food (sharks do not drink), and this small influx of water is disposed of in urine produced by the kidneys.

Maintaining Osmotic Balance in Fresh Water

The osmoregulatory problems of freshwater animals are opposite those of marine animals. Freshwater animals are constantly gaining water by osmosis and losing salts by diffusion because the osmolarity of their internal fluids is much higher than that of their surroundings. Freshwater protists such as Amoeba and Paramecium have contractile vacuoles that pump out excess water (see FIGURE 28.14). Many freshwater animals, including fishes, maintain water balance by excreting large amounts of very dilute urine and manage their salt budget by regaining lost salts in food and by active uptake from their surroundings (FIGURE 44.14b).

Salmon and other euryhaline fishes that migrate between seawater and fresh water undergo dramatic and rapid changes in osmoregulatory status. While in the ocean, salmon osmoregulate like other marine fishes by drinking seawater and excreting excess salt from the gills. When they migrate to fresh water, salmon cease drinking, begin to produce lots of dilute urine, and their gills start taking up salt from the dilute environment--just like fishes that spend their entire lives in fresh water.

Special Problems of Living in Temporary Waters

Dehydration dooms most animals, but some aquatic invertebrates living in temporary ponds and films of water around soil particles can lose almost all their body water and survive in a dormant state when their habitats dry up. This remarkable adaptation is called anhydrobiosis ("life without water"). Among the most striking examples are the tardigrades, or water bears, tiny invertebrates less than 1 mm long (FIGURE 44.15). In their active, hydrated state, these animals contain about 85%  water by weight but can dehydrate to less than 2%  water and survive in an inactive state, dry as dust, for a decade or more. Just add water, and within minutes the rehydrated tardigrades are moving about and feeding.

Fig 44-15. Anhydrobiosis. Tardigrades (water bears) inhabit temporary ponds and droplets of water in soil and on moist plants (SEMs).

Anhydrobiotic animals must have adaptations that keep cell membranes intact. Researchers are just beginning to learn how tardigrades survive drying out, but studies of anhydrobiotic roundworms (class Nematoda) show that dehydrated individuals contain large amounts of sugars, especially a disaccharide called trehalose. Consisting of two glucose units, trehalose seems to protect the cells by replacing the water associated with membranes and proteins. Many insects that survive freezing in the winter also utilize trehalose as a membrane protectant.

Maintaining Osmotic Balance on Land

The threat of desiccation is perhaps the largest regulatory problem confronting terrestrial plants and animals. Humans die if they lose about 12%  of their body water (mammals that evolved in dry enviroments, such as camels, can withstand about twice that level of dehydration). The severity of this challenge may be one reason only arthropods and vertebrates have colonized the land with great success (other phyla have terrestrial representatives, but most of their species are aquatic).

Adaptations that reduce water loss are key to survival on land. Much as a waxy cuticle contributes to the success of land plants, most terrestrial animals have body coverings that help prevent dehydration. Examples are the waxy layers of insect exoskeletons, the shells of land snails, and the multiple layers of dead, keratinized skin cells covering most terrestrial vertebrates. Many terrestrial animals, especially desert dwellers, are nocturnal; this reduces evaporative water loss by taking advantage of the lower temperatures and higher relative humidity of night air.

Despite these adaptations, most terrestrial animals lose considerable water from moist surfaces in their gas exchange organs, in urine and feces, and across the skin. Land animals balance their water budgets by drinking and eating moist foods and by using metabolic water (the water produced in mitochondria during cellular respiration). Some animals are so well adapted for minimizing water loss that they can survive in deserts without drinking. For example, many insect-eating desert birds and reptiles do not drink. Kangaroo rats lose so little water that they can recover 90%  of the loss by using metabolic water (FIGURE 44.16), gaining the remaining 10%  from the small amount of water in their diet of seeds.

A kangaroo rat loses water mainly by evaporation during gas exchange and gains water mainly from cellular metabolism. In contrast, a human loses a large amount of water in urine, and regains it mostly in food and drink.





 Most excretory systems produce urine by refining a filtrate derived from body fluids: an overview

As we will see in the next section, excretory systems are diverse, but nearly all produce urine by a two-step process. First, body fluid (blood, coelomic fluid, or hemolymph) is collected, and then the composition of the collected fluid is adjusted by selective reabsorption or secretion of solutes (FIGURE 44.17, p. 942). The initial fluid collection usually involves filtration through the selectively permeable membranes of transport epithelia. These membranes retain cells as well as proteins and other large molecules in the body fluid; hydrostatic pressure (blood pressure in many animals) forces water and small solutes, such as salts, sugars, amino acids, and nitrogenous wastes, into the excretory system. This fluid is called the filtrate.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 44-17. Key functions of excretory systems: an overview. Most excretory systems produce a filtrate by pressure-filtering body fluids. In this diagram, modeled after the vertebrate excretory system, the excretory tubule collects a filtrate from the blood. Water and solutes are forced by blood pressure across the selectively permeable membranes of a cluster of capillaries and into the excretory tubule (yellow). The filtrate is then modified by the transport epithelium lining the tubule. In the process of reabsorption, the epithelium reclaims valuable substances from the filtrate and returns them to the body fluids. In secretion, other substances, such as toxins and excess ions, are extracted from body fluids and added to the contents of the excretory tubule.

Fluid collection, even when filtration occurs, is largely nonselective, and thus it is important that essential small molecules are recovered from the filtrate and returned to the body fluids. Excretory systems use active transport to selectively reabsorb valuable solutes such as glucose, certain salts, and amino acids. Nonessential solutes and wastes (for example, excess salts and toxins) are left in the filtrate or are added to it by selective secretion, which also uses active transport. The pumping of various solutes also adjusts the osmotic movement of water into or out of the filtrate.





 Diverse excretory systems are variations on a tubular theme

Protonephridia: Flame-Bulb Systems

Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) have excretory systems called protonephridia. A protonephridium is a network of dead-end tubules lacking internal openings (FIGURE 44.18). The tubules branch throughout the body, and the smallest branches are capped by a cellular unit called a flame bulb. The flame bulb has a tuft of cilia projecting into the tubule. The beating of the cilia draws water and solutes from the interstitial fluid through the flame bulb (filtration) into the tubule system, and then moves the urine outward through the tubules until they empty to the external environment through openings called nephridiopores. Excreted urine is very dilute in freshwater flatworms, helping balance the osmotic uptake of water from the environment. Apparently, the tubules reabsorb most solutes before the urine exits the body.

The flame-bulb systems of freshwater flatworms seem to function mainly in osmoregulation; most metabolic wastes diffuse out of the animal across the body surface or are excreted into the gastrovascular cavity and eliminated through the mouth (see Chapter 33). However, in some parasitic flatworms, which are isoosmotic to the surrounding fluids of their host organisms, protonephridia function mainly to dispose of nitrogenous wastes. This difference in function shows how structures common to a group of organisms can be adapted in diverse ways by evolution in different environments. Protonephridia are also found in rotifers, some annelids, the larvae of mollusks, and lancelets, which are invertebrate chordates. (See Chapters 33 and 34 to review these animal phyla.)

Metanephridia

Another type of tubular excretory system, the metanephridium, has internal openings that collect body fluids (FIGURE 44.19). Metanephridia are found in most annelids, including earthworms. Each segment of a worm has a pair of metanephridia, which are immersed in coelomic fluid and enveloped by a capillary network. The internal opening of a metanephridium is surrounded by a ciliated funnel, the nephrostome, which collects fluid from the coelom.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 44-19. Metanephridia of an earthworm. Each segment of the worm contains a pair of metanephridia (shown in green and blue), which collect coelomic fluid from the adjacent anterior segment. Fluid enters the nephrostome and passes through the coiled collecting tubule, which includes a storage bladder that opens to the outside through the nephridiopore. Nitrogenous wastes remain in the fluid and are excreted, but certain salts are pumped back into the blood. An earthworm's urine is very dilute, with this loss of water balancing osmotic uptake of water through the skin.

An earthworm's metanephridia have both excretory and osmoregulatory functions. As urine moves along the tubule, the transport epithelium bordering the lumen reabsorbs most solutes and returns them to the blood in the capillaries. Nitrogenous wastes remain in the tubule and are dumped to the outside. Earthworms inhabit damp soil and usually experience a net uptake of water by osmosis. Their metanephridia balance the water influx by producing dilute urine (hypoosmotic to the body fluids).

Malpighian Tubules

Insects and other terrestrial arthropods have organs called Malpighian tubules that remove nitrogenous wastes and also function in osmoregulation (FIGURE 44.20). Malpighian tubules open into the digestive tract and dead-end at tips that are immersed in hemolymph (circulatory fluid). The transport epithelium lining the tubules secretes certain solutes, including nitrogenous wastes, from the hemolymph into the lumen of the tubule. Water follows the solutes into the tubule by osmosis, and the fluid then passes into the rectum, where most solutes are pumped back into the hemolymph. Water again follows the solutes, and the nitrogenous wastes (mainly insoluble uric acid) are eliminated as nearly dry matter along with the feces. The insect excretory system--highly effective in conserving water--is one of several key adaptations that contributed to the tremendous success of these animals on land.

Fig 44-20. Malpighian tubules of insects. Malpighian tubules are outfoldings of the digestive tract. The tubules secrete nitrogenous wastes and salts from the hemolymph into the tubule lumen, and water follows these solutes by osmosis. Most of the salts and water are reabsorbed across the epithelium of the rectum, and the nearly dry nitrogenous wastes are eliminated with the feces.

Vertebrate Kidneys

The kidneys of vertebrates usually function in both osmoregulation and excretion. Like the excretory organs of most animal phyla, kidneys are built of tubules. The osmoconforming hagfishes, which are among the most primitive living vertebrates, have kidneys with segmentally arranged excretory tubules, and it is likely that the excretory structures of vertebrate ancestors were also segmented. However, the kidneys of most vertebrates are compact, nonsegmented organs containing numerous tubules arranged in a highly organized manner. A dense network of capillaries intimately associated with the tubules, along with ducts and other structures that carry urine out of the tubules and kidney and eventually out of the body, are also integral parts of the vertebrate excretory system.

We will focus first on the mammalian version of the vertebrate excretory system, using humans as our example. We will then compare the excretory organs of the various vertebrate classes to see evolutionary modifications that function in different environments.





 Nephrons and associated blood vessels are the functional units of the mammalian kidney

Mammals have a pair of kidneys. Each kidney, bean-shaped and about 10 cm long in humans, is supplied with blood by a renal artery and a renal vein (FIGURE 44.21). Blood flow through the kidneys is voluminous. In humans the kidneys account for less than 1%  of body weight, but they receive about 20%  of resting cardiac output. Urine exits each kidney through a duct called the ureter, and both ureters drain into a common urinary bladder. During urination, urine is expelled from the urinary bladder through a tube called the urethra, which empties to the outside near the vagina in females or through the penis in males. Sphincter muscles near the junction of the urethra and the bladder control urination.

Structure and Function of the Nephron and Associated Structures

The mammalian kidney has two distinct regions, an outer renal cortex and an inner renal medulla (see FIGURE 44.21). Packing both regions are microscopic excretory tubules and their associated blood vessels. The nephron--the functional unit of the vertebrate kidney--consists of a single long tubule and a ball of capillaries called the glomerulus. The blind end of the tubule forms a cup-shaped swelling, called Bowman's capsule, which surrounds the glomerulus. Each human kidney packs about a million nephrons, with a total tubule length of 80 km.

Filtration of the Blood. Filtration occurs as blood pressure forces fluid from the blood in the glomerulus into the lumen of Bowman's capsule. The porous capillaries, along with specialized cells of the capsule called podocytes, are permeable to water and small solutes but not to blood cells or large molecules such as plasma proteins. Filtration of small molecules is nonselective and the filtrate in the Bowman's capsule contains salts, glucose, and vitamins; nitrogenous wastes such as urea; and other small molecules--a mixture that mirrors the concentrations of these substances in blood plasma.

Pathway of the Filtrate. From Bowman's capsule, the filtrate passes through three regions of the nephron: the proximal tubule; the loop of Henle, a hairpin turn with a descending limb and an ascending limb; and the distal tubule. The distal tubule empties into a collecting duct, which receives processed filtrate from many nephrons. The many collecting ducts of the kidney empty into the renal pelvis, which is drained by the ureter.

In the human kidney, about 80%  of the nephrons, the cortical nephrons, have reduced loops of Henle and are almost entirely confined to the renal cortex. The other 20% , the juxtamedullary nephrons, have well-developed loops that extend deeply into the renal medulla (see FIGURE 44.21). Only mammals and birds have juxtamedullary nephrons; the nephrons of other vertebrates lack loops of Henle. It is the juxtamedullary nephrons that enable mammals to produce urine that is hyperosmotic to body fluids, an adaptation that is extremely important for water conservation.

The nephron and the collecting duct are lined by a transport epithelium that processes the filtrate to form the urine. One of this epithelium's most important tasks is reabsorption of solutes and water. From 1,100 to 2,000 L of blood flows through a pair of human kidneys each day, a volume about 275 times the total volume of blood in the body. From this enormous traffic of blood, the nephrons and collecting ducts process about 180 L of initial filtrate, equivalent to two or three times the body weight of an average person. Of this, nearly all of the sugar, vitamins, and other organic nutrients, and about 99%  of the water, are reabsorbed into the blood, leaving only about 1.5 L of urine to be voided.

Blood Vessels Associated with the Nephrons. Each nephron is supplied with blood by an afferent arteriole, a branch of the renal artery that subdivides into the capillaries of the glomerulus. The capillaries converge as they leave the glomerulus, forming an efferent arteriole. This vessel subdivides again into a second network of capillaries, the peritubular capillaries, which surround the proximal and distal tubules. Additional capillaries extend downward to form the vasa recta, the capillary system that serves the loop of Henle. The vasa recta is also a loop, with a descending vessel and an ascending vessel conveying blood in opposite directions.

Although the excretory tubules and their surrounding capillaries are closely associated, they do not exchange materials directly. The tubules and capillaries are immersed in interstitial fluid, through which various substances diffuse between the plasma within capillaries and the filtrate within the nephron tubule.

From Blood Filtrate to Urine: A Closer Look

In this section we concentrate on how the filtrate becomes urine as it flows through the mammalian nephron and collecting duct. The circled numbers correspond to the numbers in FIGURE 44.22, page 946.

		Proximal tubule. Secretion and reabsorption in the proximal tubule substantially alter the volume and composition of filtrate. For example, the cells of the transport epithelium help maintain a constant pH in body fluids by the controlled secretion of hydrogen ions. The cells also synthesize and secrete ammonia, which neutralizes the acid and keeps the filtrate from becoming too acidic. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia the cells produce and secrete, and the urine of a mammal usually contains some ammonia from this source (even though most nitrogenous waste is excreted as urea). The proximal tubules also reabsorb about 90%  of the important buffer bicarbonate (HCO3-). Drugs and other poisons that have been processed in the liver pass from the peritubular capillaries into the interstitial fluid, and then are secreted across the epithelium of the proximal tubule into the nephron's lumen. Conversely, valuable nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and potassium (K+), are actively or passively transported from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, and then move into the peritubular capillaries.

One of the most important functions of the proximal tubule is reabsorption of most of the NaCl (salt) and water from the huge initial filtrate volume. Salt in the filtrate diffuses into the cells of the transport epithelium, and the membranes of the cells actively transport Na+ into the interstitial fluid. This transfer of positive charge is balanced by the passive transport of Cl- out of the tubule. As salt moves from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, water follows by osmosis. The exterior side of the epithelium has a much smaller surface area than the side facing the lumen, which minimizes leakage of salt and water back into the tubule. Instead, the salt and water now diffuse from the interstitial fluid into the peritubular capillaries.


			  
		Descending limb of the loop of Henle. Reabsorption of water continues as the filtrate moves into the descending limb of the loop of Henle. Here the transport epithelium is freely permeable to water but not very permeable to salt and other small solutes. For water to move out of the tubule by osmosis, the interstitial fluid bathing the tubule must be hyperosmotic to the filtrate. The osmolarity of the interstitial fluid does in fact become progressively greater from the outer cortex to the inner medulla of the kidney (the mechanism that maintains this gradient will be discussed shortly). Thus, filtrate moving downward from the cortex to the medulla within the descending limb of the loop of Henle continues to lose water to interstitial fluid of greater and greater osmolarity. As water departs by osmosis, the solute concentration of the filtrate increases.


			  
		Ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The filtrate reaches the tip of the loop, deep in the renal medulla in the case of juxtamedullary nephrons, then moves back to the cortex within the ascending limb. In contrast to the descending limb, the transport epithelium of the ascending limb is permeable to salt but not to water. The ascending limb actually has two specialized regions: a thin segment near the loop tip and a thick segment adjacent to the distal tubule. As filtrate ascends in the thin segment, NaCl, which became concentrated in the descending limb, diffuses out of the permeable tubule into the interstitial fluid. This movement of salt adds to the high osmolarity of the interstitial fluid in the medulla. The exodus of salt from the filtrate continues in the thick segment of the ascending limb, but here the epithelium actively transports NaCl into the interstitial fluid. By losing salt without giving up water, the filtrate becomes progressively more dilute as it moves up to the cortex in the ascending limb of the loop.


			  
		Distal tubule. The distal tubule is another important site of secretion and reabsorption. It plays a key role in regulating the K+ and NaCl concentration of body fluids by varying the amount of the K+ that is secreted into the filtrate and the amount of NaCl reabsorbed from the filtrate. Like the proximal tubule, the distal tubule also contributes to pH regulation, by the controlled secretion of H+ and reabsorption of bicarbonate (HCO3-).


			  
		Collecting duct. The collecting duct carries the filtrate through the medulla to the renal pelvis. By actively reabsorbing NaCl, the transport epithelium of the collecting duct plays a large role in determining how much salt is actually excreted in the urine. The epithelium is permeable to water but not to salt or (in the renal cortex) to urea. Thus, as the collecting duct traverses the gradient of osmolarity in the kidney, the filtrate becomes increasingly concentrated as it loses more and more water by osmosis to the hyperosmotic interstitial fluid. In the inner medulla, the duct becomes permeable to urea. Because of the high urea concentration in the filtrate at this point, some urea diffuses out of the duct and into the interstitial fluid. Along with NaCl, this interstitial urea is a major solute contributing to the high osmolarity of the interstitial fluid in the medulla. It is this high osmolarity that enables the mammalian kidney to conserve water by excreting urine that is hyperosmotic to the general body fluids.





 The mammalian kidney's ability to conserve water is a key terrestrial adaptation

The osmolarity of human blood is about 300 mosm/L, but the kidney can excrete urine up to four times as concentrated--about 1,200 mosm/L. Some mammals can do even better. For example, Australian hopping mice, which live in dry desert regions, can produce urine concentrated to 9,300 mosm/L--9 times as concentrated as seawater and 25 times as concentrated as their body fluid.

In a mammalian kidney, the cooperative action and precise arrangement of the loops of Henle and the collecting ducts are largely responsible for the osmotic gradient that concentrates the urine. But even with this highly organized structure, the maintenance of osmotic differences and the production of hyperosmotic urine are only possible because considerable energy is expended for the active transport of solutes against concentration gradients. In essence, the nephrons--especially the loops of Henle--can be thought of as tiny energy-consuming machines whose function is to produce a region of high osmolarity in the kidney, which can then be used to extract water from the urine in the collecting duct. The two primary solutes in this osmolarity gradient are NaCl, which is deposited in the renal medulla by the loop of Henle, and urea, which leaks across the epithelium of the collecting duct in the inner medulla (see FIGURE 44.22).

Conservation of Water by Two Solute Gradients

To better understand the physiology of the mammalian kidney as a water-conserving organ, let's retrace the flow of filtrate through the excretory tubule, this time focusing on how the juxtamedullary nephrons maintain an osmolarity gradient in the kidney and use that gradient to excrete a hyperosmotic urine (FIGURE 44.23, p. 948). Filtrate passing from Bowman's capsule to the proximal tubule has an osmolarity of about 300 mosm/L, the same as blood. As the filtrate flows through the proximal tubule in the renal cortex, a large amount of water and salt is reabsorbed; thus, the volume of filtrate decreases substantially but its osmolarity remains about the same.

Fig 44-23. How the human kidney concentrates urine: the two-solute model. From the cortex to the inner medulla, the interstitial fluid increases in osmolarity from about 300 to 1,200 mosm/L. Two solutes contribute to this gradient: NaCl and urea. The loop of Henle maintains the interstitial gradient of NaCl. The filtrate concentration of this salt increases because of the loss of water from the descending limb, then the ascending limb leaks the salt into the interstitial fluid. Additional salt is actively transported out of the thick segment of the ascending limb. The countercurrent-like arrangement of descending and ascending limbs (and the associated capillaries; FIGURE 44.21) helps maintain the high salt concentration in the medulla. The second solute, urea, is added to the interstitial fluid of the medulla by diffusion out of the collecting duct (most of the urea in the filtrate remains in the collecting duct and is excreted). The filtrate makes a total of three trips between the cortex and medulla: first down, then up, and then down one more time in the collecting duct. As the filtrate flows in the collecting duct past interstitial fluid of increasing osmolarity, more and more water moves out of the duct by osmosis, thereby concentrating the solutes, including urea, that are left behind in the filtrate. Under conditions in which the kidney conserves as much water as possible, urine can reach an osmolarity of about 1,200 mosm/L, considerably hyperosmotic to blood (about 300 mosm/L). This ability to excrete nitrogenous wastes with a minimal loss of water is a key terrestrial adaptation of mammals.

As the filtrate flows from cortex to medulla in the descending limb of the loop of Henle, water leaves the tubule by osmosis. The osmolarity of the filtrate increases as solutes, including NaCl, become more concentrated. The highest osmolarity occurs at the elbow of the loop of Henle. This maximizes the diffusion of salt out of the tubule as the filtrate rounds the curve and enters the ascending limb, which, remember, is permeable to salt but not to water. Thus, the two limbs of the loop of Henle cooperate in maintaining the gradient of osmolarity in the interstitial fluid of the kidney. The descending limb produces a progressively saltier filtrate, and the ascending limb exploits this concentration of NaCl to help maintain a high osmolarity in the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla.

Notice that the loop of Henle has several qualities of a countercurrent system, similar in principle to the countercurrent mechanisms that maximize oxygen absorption by fish gills (see FIGURES 42.19 and 42.20) or reduce heat loss from endotherm legs (see FIGURE 44.5). Although the two limbs of the loop are not in direct contact, they are close enough together to exchange substances through the interstitial fluid. The nephron can concentrate salt in the inner medulla largely because exchange between opposing flows in the descending and ascending limbs overcomes the tendency for diffusion to even out salt concentration throughout the kidney's interstitial fluid, thus confining the high salt concentration in the interior of the kidney.

What prevents the capillaries of the vasa recta from dissipating the gradient by carrying away the high concentration of NaCl in the medulla's interstitial fluid? Notice in FIGURE 44.21 that the vasa recta is also a countercurrent system, with descending and ascending vessels carrying blood in opposite directions through the kidney's osmolarity gradient. As the descending vessel conveys blood toward the inner medulla, water is lost from the blood and NaCl diffuses into it. These fluxes are reversed as blood flows back toward the cortex in the ascending vessel, with water reentering the blood and salt diffusing out. Thus, the vasa recta can supply the kidney with nutrients and other important substances carried by blood without interfering with the osmolarity gradient that makes it possible for the kidney to excrete a hyperosmotic urine.

The countercurrent-like characteristics of the loop of Henle and the vasa recta make it easier to maintain the steep osmotic gradient between the medulla and cortex. However, any osmotic gradient in an animal will eventually be eliminated by diffusion unless energy is expended to preserve it. In the kidney this expenditure largely occurs in the thick segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where NaCl is actively transported out of the tubule. Even with the benefits of countercurrent exchange, this process--along with other renal active transport systems--consumes considerable ATP, and for its size the kidney has one of the highest metabolic rates of any organ.

By the time the filtrate reaches the distal tubule, it is actually hypoosmotic to body fluids because of active transport of NaCl out of the thick segment of the ascending limb. Now the filtrate descends again toward the medulla, this time in the collecting duct, which is permeable to water but not to salt. Therefore, osmosis extracts water from the filtrate as it passes from cortex to medulla and encounters interstitial fluid of increasing osmolarity. This concentrates salt, urea, and other solutes in the filtrate. Some urea leaks out of the lower portion of the collecting duct and contributes to the high interstitial osmolarity of the inner medulla. (This urea is recycled by diffusion into the loop of Henle, but continual leakage from the collecting duct maintains a high interstitial urea concentration.) Before leaving the kidney, the urine may attain the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid in the inner medulla, which can be as high as 1,200 mosm/L. Although isoosmotic to the inner medulla's interstitial fluid, the urine is hyperosmotic to blood and interstitial fluid elsewhere in the body. This high osmolarity allows the solutes remaining in the urine to be excreted from the body with minimal water loss.

The juxtamedullary nephron, with its urine-concentrating features, is a key adaptation to terrestrial life, enabling mammals to get rid of salts and nitrogenous wastes without squandering water. As we have seen, the remarkable ability of the mammalian kidney to produce hyperosmotic urine is completely dependent on the precise arrangement of the tubules and collecting ducts in the renal cortex and medulla. In this respect, the kidney is one of the clearest examples of how the function of an organ is inseparably linked to its structure.

How the Nervous System and Hormones Regulate Kidney Functions

One of the most important aspects of the mammalian kidney is its ability to adjust both the volume and osmolarity of urine, depending on the animal's water and salt balance and the rate of urea production. In situations of high salt intake and low water availability, a mammal can excrete urea and salt with minimal water loss in small volumes of hyperosmotic urine. But if salt is scarce and fluid intake is high, the kidney can get rid of the excess water with little salt loss by producing large volumes of hypoosmotic urine (as dilute as 70 mosm/L, compared to about 300 mosm/L for human blood). This versatility in osmoregulatory function is managed with a combination of nervous and hormonal controls.

One hormone important in regulating water balance is antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (FIGURE 44.24a, p. 950). It is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and is stored in and released from the pituitary gland, which is positioned just below the hypothalamus. Osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus monitor the osmolarity of blood; when it rises above a set point of 300 mosm/L (perhaps due to water loss from sweating in a hot environment), more ADH is released into the bloodstream and reaches the kidney. The main targets of ADH are the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney, where the hormone increases the permeability of the epithelium to water. This amplifies water reabsorption, which reduces urine volume and helps prevent further increase of blood osmolarity above the set point. By negative feedback, the subsiding osmolarity of the blood reduces the activity of osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus, and less ADH is then secreted. But only the gain of additional water in food and drink can bring osmolarity all the way back down to 300 mosm/L. Conversely, if a large intake of water has reduced blood osmolarity below the set point, very little ADH is released. This decreases the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts, so water reabsorption is reduced, resulting in an increased discharge of dilute urine. (Increased urination is called diuresis, and it is because ADH opposes this state that it is called antidiuretic hormone.) Alcohol can disturb water balance by inhibiting the release of ADH, causing excessive urinary water loss and dehydration (which may cause some of the symptoms of a hangover). Normally, blood osmolarity, ADH release, and water reabsorption in the kidney are all linked in a feedback loop that contributes to homeostasis.

Fig 44-24. Hormonal control of the kidney by negative feedback circuits. (a) Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) enhances fluid retention by making the kidneys reclaim more water. The release of ADH is triggered when osmoreceptor cells in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the osmolarity of the blood. In this situation, the osmoreceptor cells also promote thirst. Drinking reduces the osmolarity of the blood, which inhibits the secretion of ADH, completing the feedback circuit. (b) The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) centers on the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). The JGA responds to a decrease in blood pressure or blood volume by releasing the enzyme renin into the bloodstream (small black arrows). In the blood, renin initiates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by causing arterioles to constrict. It also increases blood volume in two ways: by signaling the proximal tubules of the nephrons to reabsorb more NaCl and water (not illustrated) and by stimulating the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, a hormone that makes the distal tubules reabsorb more Na+ and water. This leads to an increase in blood volume and pressure, completing the feedback circuit by suppressing the release of renin.

A second regulatory mechanism involves a specialized tissue called the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), located near the afferent arteriole that supplies blood to the glomerulus (FIGURE 44.24b). When blood pressure or blood volume in the afferent arteriole drops (sometimes as a result of reduced salt intake), the enzyme renin initiates chemical reactions that convert a plasma protein called angiotensinogen to a peptide called angiotensin II. Functioning as a hormone, angiotensin II increases blood pressure and blood volume in several ways. It raises blood pressure by constricting arterioles, decreasing blood flow to many capillaries, including those of the kidney. Angiotensin II also stimulates the proximal tubules of the nephrons to reabsorb more NaCl and water. This reduces the amount of salt and water excreted in the urine and consequently raises blood volume and pressure. Another effect of angiotensin II is stimulation of the adrenal glands, organs located atop the kidneys, to release a hormone called aldosterone. This hormone acts on the nephrons' distal tubules, making them reabsorb more sodium (Na+) and water and increasing blood volume and pressure. In summary, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is part of a complex feedback circuit that functions in homeostasis. A drop in blood pressure and blood volume triggers renin release from the JGA. In turn, the rise in blood pressure and volume resulting from the various actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone reduce the release of renin (see FIGURE 44.24b).

The functions of ADH and the RAAS may seem to be redundant, but this is not the case. Both increase water reabsorption, but they counter different osmoregulatory problems. The release of ADH is a response to an increase in the osmolarity of the blood, as when the body is dehydrated from excessive loss or inadequate intake of water. However, a situation that causes an excessive loss of salt and body fluids--an injury, for example, or severe diarrhea--will reduce blood volume without increasing osmolarity. This will not induce a change in ADH release, but the RAAS will detect the fall in blood volume and pressure and respond by increasing water and Na+ reabsorption. Normally, ADH and the RAAS are partners in homeostasis; ADH alone would lower blood Na+ concentration by stimulating water reabsorption in the kidney, but the RAAS helps maintain balance by stimulating Na+ reabsorption.

Still another hormone, a peptide called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), opposes the RAAS. The walls of the atria of the heart release ANF in response to an increase in blood volume and pressure. ANF inhibits the release of renin from the JGA, inhibits NaCl reabsorption by the collecting ducts, and reduces aldosterone release from the adrenal glands. These actions lower blood volume and pressure. Thus, ADH, the RAAS, and ANF provide an elaborate system of checks and balances that regulate the kidney's ability to control the osmolarity, salt concentration, volume, and pressure of blood.

The flexibility of the mammalian kidney enables it to adjust rapidly to contrasting osmoregulatory and excretory problems. The South American vampire bat (FIGURE 44.25, p. 951) illustrates this versatility. Bats of this species feed on the blood of large birds and mammals. With a feeding mechanism that is surprisingly stealthy, the bats use sharp teeth to make a small incision in the victim's skin and then lap up blood from the wound. Anticoagulents in the bat's saliva prevent the blood from clotting, but the prey animal is usually not seriously harmed. Because vampire bats often search for many hours and fly for long distances to locate a suitable victim, they benefit from consuming as much blood as possible when they do find prey--so much that after feeding, a bat could be too heavy to fly. This problem is solved by the bat using its kidneys to offload much of the water absorbed from a blood meal by excreting large volumes of dilute urine as it feeds, at rates of up to 24%  of body mass per hour. Having lost enough weight to take off, the bat can fly back to its roost in a cave or hollow tree, where it spends the day. In the roost, the bat faces a very different regulatory problem. Its food is mostly protein, which generates large quantities of urea--but roosting bats don't have access to drinking water. Their kidneys shift to producing small quantities of highly concentrated urine (up to 4,600 mosm/L), an adjustment that disposes of the urea load while conserving as much water as possible. The vampire bat's ability to alternate rapidly between producing large amounts of dilute urine and small amounts of very hyperosmotic urine is an essential part of its adaption to an unusual food source.

Fig 44-25. A vampire bat (Desmodus rotundas), a mammal with a unique excretory situation. While the bat feeds on a blood meal, its kidneys excrete dilute urine copiously, thus shedding weight for the flight home. While the bat roosts during the day, the kidneys conserve water by excreting small quantities of urine that is very concentrated in the urea that is produced during the metabolism of proteins from the blood meal.

Having considered the mammalian kidney and its regulation in detail, we can now compare the structures and functions of kidneys in other vertebrate classes.





 Diverse adaptations of the vertebrate kidney have evolved in different habitats

Variations in nephron structure and function equip the kidneys of different vertebrates for osmoregulation in their various habitats. We have seen, for instance, that nephrons of the mammalian kidney can conserve water by making highly concentrated urine. Mammals that excrete the most hyperosmotic urine, such as hopping mice and other desert mammals, have exceptionally long loops of Henle. Long loops maintain steep osmotic gradients in the kidney, resulting in urine becoming very concentrated as it passes from cortex to medulla in the collecting ducts. In contrast, beavers, which spend much of their time in fresh water and rarely face problems of dehydration, have nephrons with very short loops, resulting in a much lower ability to concentrate urine.

Birds, like mammals, have kidneys with juxtamedullary nephrons that specialize in conserving water. However, the nephrons of birds have much shorter loops of Henle than do mammalian nephrons. Bird kidneys, therefore, cannot concentrate urine to the osmolarities achieved by mammalian kidneys. Although they can produce a hyperosmotic urine, the main water conservation adaptation of birds is use of uric acid as the nitrogen excretion molecule.

The kidneys of reptiles, having only cortical nephrons, produce urine that is, at most, isoosmotic to body fluids. However, the epithelium of the cloaca (see Chapter 34) helps conserve fluid by reabsorbing some of the water present in urine and feces. Also, like birds, most terrestrial reptiles excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid.

In contrast to mammals and birds, a freshwater fish must excrete excess water because the animal is hyperosmotic to its surroundings. Instead of conserving water, the nephrons produce a large volume of very dilute urine. Freshwater fishes conserve salts by reabsorption of ions from the filtrate in the nephrons.

Amphibian kidneys function much like those of freshwater fishes. When in fresh water, the skin of the frog accumulates certain salts from the water by active transport, and the kidneys excrete dilute urine. On land, where dehydration is the most pressing problem of osmoregulation, frogs conserve body fluid by reabsorbing water across the epithelium of the urinary bladder.

Bony fishes that live in seawater, being hypoosmotic to their surroundings, have the opposite problem of their freshwater relatives. In many species, nephrons lack glomeruli and Bowman's capsules, and concentrated urine is formed by secreting ions into the excretory tubules. Thus, as mentioned previously, the kidneys of marine fishes excrete very little urine and function mainly to get rid of divalent ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42-, which the fish takes in by its incessant drinking of seawater. Its gills excrete mainly monovalent ions such as Na+ and Cl- and the bulk of its nitrogenous wastes in the form of NH4+ (ammonium ion).





 Interacting regulatory systems maintain homeostasis

Numerous regulatory systems are involved in maintaining homeostasis in an animal's internal environment. As we have seen, the mechanisms that rid the body of nitrogenous wastes operate hand in hand with those involved in osmoregulation and are often closely linked with energy budgets and temperature regulation. Similarly, the regulation of body temperature directly affects metabolic rate and exercise capacity and is closely associated with mechanisms controlling blood pressure, gas exchange, and energy balance. Under some conditions, usually at the physical extremes compatible with life, the demands of one system might come into conflict with those of other systems. For instance, in hot, dry environments, water conservation often takes precedence over evaporative heat loss. Many desert animals tolerate occasional abnormally high body temperature, which helps them save water by reducing evaporation. However, if body temperature exceeds a critical upper limit, the animal will start vigorous evaporative cooling and risk dangerous dehydration. Normally, however, the various regulatory systems act together to maintain homeostasis in the internal environment.

Our discussion of homeostasis would be incomplete without mention of the liver, the vertebrate body's most functionally diverse organ. Liver functions are pivotal to homeostasis and involve interaction with most of the body's organ systems. For example, liver cells interact with the circulatory system in taking up glucose from the blood. Liver cells store excess glucose as glycogen and, in response to the body's demand for fuel, convert glycogen back to glucose, releasing glucose to the blood. The liver also synthesizes plasma proteins important in blood clotting and in maintaining the osmotic balance of the blood. Assisting the excretory system, liver cells detoxify many chemical poisons and prepare metabolic wastes for disposal. The liver's diverse functions and interactions with other organs accentuate the point that homeostasis requires the coordinated action of several body systems.

In this chapter we have touched on some of the ways the nervous system and hormones regulate organs involved in homeostasis. We concentrate on the hormonal control of homeostasis in the next chapter.

People offer hormones as an explanation for the howling of alley cats and the moodiness of teenagers. Over a million diabetics in the United States take the hormone insulin, and other hormones are used in cosmetics intended to keep the skin smooth or are added to livestock feed to fatten cattle. The monarch butterfly in the photograph that opens this chapter has just emerged from the silvery cocoon attached to the twig above it. In becoming an adult, the butterfly has undergone a complete change of body form, a metamorphosis regulated by hormones. Internal communication involving those hormones makes it possible for different parts of the insect's body to develop in concert.

An animal hormone (from the Greek hormon, excite) is a chemical signal that is secreted into body fluids, most often into the blood, and communicates regulatory messages within the body. Hormones may reach all parts of the body, but only certain types of cells, the target cells, are equipped to respond. Thus, a given hormone traveling in the bloodstream elicits specific responses--a change in metabolism, for example--from selected target cells, while other cell types ignore that particular hormone.

This chapter's focus is internal chemical signals--what they are and how they function within an animal's body. Our over-arching theme is the role of chemical signals in maintaining homeostasis, a dynamic, steady state in body functions.





AN INTRODUCTION TO REGULATORY SYSTEMS

 

 The endocrine system and the nervous system are structurally, chemically, and functionally related



 

 Invertebrate regulatory systems clearly illustrate endocrine and nervous system interactions



Animals have two systems of internal communication and regulation, the nervous system and the endocrine system. The nervous system, which we will study in Chapters 48 and 49, conveys high-speed signals along specialized cells called neurons. These rapid messages function in such activities as the movement of body parts in response to sudden environmental changes--jerking your hand away from a flame, for example.

Slower means of communication regulate other biological processes, such as the maturation of a butterfly. Different parts of the body must be informed how fast to grow and when to develop the characteristics that distinguish male from female or the juvenile from the adult of a species. This kind of information is often relayed by hormones.

Collectively, all of an animal's hormone-secreting cells constitute the endocrine system. Hormone-secreting organs are called endocrine glands, also called ductless glands because they secrete their chemical messengers directly into body fluids. In contrast, exocrine glands secrete chemicals, such as sweat, mucus, and digestive enzymes, into ducts that convey the products to the appropriate locations.

Although it is convenient to distinguish between the endocrine and nervous systems, the lines between these two regulatory systems are blurred, and homeostasis depends heavily on overlap between them.





CHEMICAL SIGNALS AND THEIR MODES OF ACTION

 

 A variety of local regulators affect neighboring target cells



 

 Most chemical signals bind to plasma-membrane proteins, initiating signal-transduction pathways



 

 Steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and some local regulators enter target cells and bind to intracellular receptors



Chemical signals play a major role in coordinating the functioning of all animals. Hormones convey information via the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body, while other types of chemical messengers reach their target in other ways. As you learned in Chapter 11, local regulators act between cells that are neighbors (see FIGURE 11.3). Once secreted by the cells that make them, these signal molecules are taken up by nearby target cells, broken down by enzymes in the vicinity, or fixed in place by extracellular matrix, all within seconds or even milliseconds. Consequently, local regulators can affect only local targets. Still other chemical signals, called pheromones, carry messages between different individuals of a species, as in mate attraction. You will learn more about pheromones in Chapter 46, which discusses animal reproduction. Before concentrating on hormones and their modes of action, let's take a brief look at some local regulators and their effects on target cells.





THE VERTEBRATE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

 

 The hypothalamus and pituitary integrate many functions of the vertebrate endocrine system



 

 The pineal gland is involved in biorhythms



 

 Thyroid hormones function in development, bioenergetics, and homeostasis



 

 Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin balance blood calcium



 

 Endocrine tissues of the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon, antagonistic hormones that regulate blood glucose



 

 The adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex help the body manage stress



 

 Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior



Of the numerous hormones regulating body functions of vertebrates, some affect only one or a few tissues. Others, such as the sex hormones, which promote male and female characteristics, affect most of the tissues of the body. Some hormones, called tropic hormones, have other endocrine glands as their targets and are particularly important to our understanding of chemical coordination. In studying hormonal regulation of the vertebrate body, you may find FIGURE 45.5, showing the locations of the major endocrine glands in the human body, and TABLE 45.1, summarizing the functions of the major vertebrate hormones, especially helpful. In the text, small sketches accompanying each section will help you keep track of each gland's location. We begin our discussion of the vertebrate endocrine system by looking at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which control much of the endocrine system.

Fig 45-5. Human endocrine glands surveyed in this chapter. In addition to the glands shown here, many organs with primarily nonendocrine functions also have cells that secrete hormones. These organs, which are discussed in other chapters, include the heart, the stomach, the small intestines, the kidney, and the placenta of a pregnant woman. Also discussed elsewhere is the thymus gland, an important component of the immune system (Chapter 43). Quite large during childhood, the thymus begins to decline at puberty, when the immune system is well established. By adulthood it is largely replaced by adipose and fibrous tissue, but it continues to function throughout life. It secretes several chemical signals, including thymosin, that stimulate the development and differentiation of T lymphocytes after they leave the thymus. The other endocrine organs in this drawing are discussed in this chapter.

 The endocrine system and the nervous system are structurally, chemically, and functionally related

In this chapter we will see many examples of the close relationship between the endocrine system and the nervous system. Many endocrine organs and tissues contain specialized nerve cells, called neurosecretory cells, that secrete hormones. Animals as distinct as insects and vertebrates have neurosecretory cells in their brain that secrete hormones into the blood. Several chemicals serve both as hormones of the endocrine system and as signals in the nervous system. Epinephrine, for example, functions in the vertebrate body as the so-called "fight or flight" hormone (produced by the adrenal medulla, an endocrine gland) and as a neurotransmitter that conveys messages between neurons in the nervous system.

The regulation of several physiological processes involves structural and functional overlap between the endocrine and nervous systems. Each system affects the output of the other. For instance, the release of milk by a nursing mother is controlled by a series of interdependent nervous and hormonal signals. Suckling stimulates sensory cells in the nipples, and nervous signals to the part of the brain called the hypothalamus trigger the release of the hormone oxytocin from the pituitary gland. Oxytocin then causes the mammary glands to secrete milk.

Feedback is another feature common to both the endocrine and nervous systems. The chemical and neural events leading to milk release involve positive feedback. The generation of nerve signals (impulses) also involves positive feedback, as we will see in Chapter 48. Negative feedback regulates many endocrine and nervous mechanisms, especially those involved in maintaining homeostasis. FIGURE 45.1 illustrates one example, and we will see several others in this chapter.

Fig 45-1. An example of how feedback regulation maintains homeostasis. The concentration of calcium ions in the blood is maintained close to a set point by the antagonistic (opposite) actions of two hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Excess blood calcium triggers the secretion of calcitonin, which decreases the calcium level; when calcium gets too low, secretion of PTH causes it to rise.





 Invertebrate regulatory systems clearly illustrate endocrine and nervous system interactions

Invertebrate animals have a variety of hormones that function in homeostasis--by regulating water balance, for instance. However, the hormones that have been most extensively studied function in reproduction and development. In a hydra, for example, one hormone stimulates growth and budding (asexual reproduction) but prevents sexual reproduction. In more complex invertebrates the endocrine and nervous systems are generally integrated in the control of reproduction and development. One well-studied example of nerve and hormone interaction in controlling both reproductive functions and behavior involves the hormone that regulates egg laying in the mollusk Aplysia. Secreted by specialized neurons, this hormone stimulates the laying of thousands of eggs and also inhibits feeding and locomotion, activities that interfere with reproduction.

All groups of arthropods have extensive endocrine systems. Crustaceans, for example, have hormones for growth and reproduction, water balance, movement of pigments in the integument and in the eyes, and the regulation of metabolism. Having exoskeletons that cannot stretch, crustaceans and insects appear to grow in spurts, shedding the old and secreting a new exoskeleton with each molt. Further, most insects acquire their adult characteristics in a single, terminal molt. In insects and crustaceans (and most likely in all arthropods with exoskeletons), molting is triggered by a hormone called ecdysone. In insects, ecdysone is secreted from a pair of endocrine glands, called the prothoracic glands, just behind the head (FIGURE 45.2). Besides stimulating the molt, ecdyone also favors the development of adult characteristics, as in the change from a caterpillar to a butterfly. In insects, ecdysone production is itself controlled by a second hormone, called brain hormone (BH). Produced by neurosecretory cells in the brain, this hormone promotes development by stimulating the prothoracic glands to secrete ecdysone.

Fig 45-2. Hormonal regulation of insect development. Most insects go through a series of larval stages, with each molt (shedding of the old exoskeleton) leading to a larger larva. Molting of the final larval stage gives rise to a pupa, in which metamorphosis produces the adult form of the insect. Hormones control the progression of stages as shown here.

Brain hormone and ecdysone are balanced by juvenile hormone (JH), the third hormone in this system. JH is secreted by a pair of small glands just behind the brain, the corpora allata. Juvenile hormone promotes the retention of larval (juvenile) characteristics. In the presence of a relatively high concentration of juvenile hormone, ecdysone can still stimulate molting, but the product is a larger larva. Only when the level of juvenile hormone wanes can ecdysone-induced molting produce a developmental stage called a pupa. Within the pupa, metamorphosis replaces larval anatomy with the insect's adult form. (Synthetic versions of JH are now being used as insecticides to prevent insects from maturing into reproducing adults.)

In all these invertebrate examples, we see the importance of the nervous system to hormone activity. We will see similar interactions as we survey vertebrate endocrine systems.





 A variety of local regulators affect neighboring target cells

At several points earlier in the book, we have mentioned chemical messengers that affect target cells adjacent to or near their point of secretion. For example, in Chapter 43 we described the roles of interleukins in immunity. In Chapters 11, 12, and 19 we introduced the local regulators called growth factors and their involvement in cancer.

Growth factors are peptides and proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. They must be present in the extracellular environment for many types of cells to grow, divide, and develop normally. Because growth factors are generally named for the first function discovered for them, their names can be misleading, for a given growth factor can have several kinds of target cells and a variety of functions. For instance, nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein that speeds the development of certain embryonic nerve cells, also affects developing white blood cells and several other kinds of cells.

Growth factors have been studied mainly in cell cultures, but many experiments show that growth factors work within the animal body as well as in culture. For instance, injecting epidermal growth factor (EGF) into fetal mice accelerates epidermal development. And a group of peptides known as insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), produced by the liver, is essential to skeletal development. It is likely that the interaction of numerous growth factors regulates cell behavior in developing tissues and organs of animals. Ongoing research also suggests that growth factors (specifically, transforming growth factor, TGF) can enhance the strength of synapses between neurons in the brain of a mature animal.

Another important kind of local regulator is a gas, nitric oxide (NO). Many types of cells produce NO, and it has multiple functions. Highly reactive and potentially toxic, NO usually triggers changes in a target cell within a few seconds of contact and then breaks down. Secreted by neurons, NO functions as a neurotransmitter (see Chapter 48); secreted by white blood cells, it kills certain bacteria and cancer cells in body fluids. And NO released by endothelial cells in blood vessels makes the adjacent smooth muscles relax, dilating the vessel walls. American pharmacologists Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro, and Ferid Murad shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in medicine for their pioneering work on the physiological effects of NO.

The local regulators called prostaglandins (PGs) are modified fatty acids, often derived from lipids to the plasma membrane. They are so named because they were first discovered in the components of semen produced by the human prostate gland. Prostaglandins in semen stimulate contraction of smooth muscles in the wall of the uterus, helping to convey sperm to the egg. Released from most types of cells into the interstitial fluid, prostaglandins function as local regulators affecting nearby cells in various ways. Some of the best-known actions of prostaglandins are on the female reproductive system. For example, prostaglandins secreted by cells of the placenta cause chemical changes in the nearby muscles of the uterus, making them more excitable and thereby helping to induce labor during childbirth. This is an example of a positive feedback mechanism coordinating a body function (see FIGURE 46.19).

Prostaglandins also function as local regulators in vertebrate defense systems. Various prostaglandins help induce fever and inflammation and also intensify the sensation of pain (which can be thought of as contributing to the body's defense by sounding an alarm that something harmful is going on). The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and ibuprofen result from the inhibitory effects of these drugs on prostaglandin synthesis.

Two prostaglandins with very similar molecular structures, prostaglandin E (PGE) and prostaglandin F (PGF), have opposite effects on the smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels serving the lungs. PGE causes the muscles to relax, which dilates the blood vessels and promotes oxygenation of the blood. PGF signals the muscles to contract, which constricts the vessels and reduces blood flow through the lungs. In other words, these two chemical signals are antagonistic. Shifts in their relative concentrations help maintain homeostasis in changing circumstances, making these local regulators another example of the use of antagonistic signals to counterbalance each other.





 Most chemical signals bind to plasma-membrane proteins, initiating signal-transduction pathways

As we discussed in Chapter 11, a signal molecule has a specific shape that can be recognized by that signal's target cells. Reception of the signal occurs when the signal molecule binds to a specific receptor protein, which is either built into the plasma membrane of the target cell or located inside the target cell (FIGURE 45.3). The binding of a signal molecule to a receptor protein triggers events within the target cell--signal transduction--that result in a response, a change in the cell's behavior. Cells are unresponsive to a signal if they lack the appropriate receptors. How a chemical signal brings about changes in target cells depends on whether it binds to a receptor on the target cell's surface or inside the cell.

Fig 45-3. Mechanisms of chemical signaling: a review. A chemical signal secreted by a cell either (a) binds to a receptor protein on the surface of a target cell, triggering a signal-transduction pathway, or (b) penetrates the target cell's plasma membrane and binds to a receptor inside the cell. When signal is bound to an intracellular receptor, the receptor acts as a transcription factor, causing a change in gene expression. The binding of signal to a surface receptor can lead to either a change in gene expression or a change in a cytoplasmic activity.

Almost all local regulators and a majority of hormones have plasma-membrane receptors (see FIGURE 45.3a). Chapter 11 discussed the discovery that the hormone epinephrine exerts its effects via membrane receptors. Another dramatic example of the role of membrane receptors involves changes in frog skin color, an adaptation that helps camouflage the frog as lighting changes. The darkness of the skin varies with the organelle arrangement within melanocytes, skin cells that contain the dark brown pigment melanin in cytoplasmic organelles called melanosomes. The frog's skin appears light when the melanosomes are clustered tightly around the cell nuclei and darker when the melanosomes spread throughout the cytoplasm. The arrangement of melanosomes is controlled by a peptide hormone called melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), secreted by the pituitary gland. When MSH is added to the interstitial fluid surrounding the pigment-containing cells, the melanosomes disperse. However, direct microinjection of MSH into individual melanocytes does not induce melanosome dispersion--evidence that interaction between the hormone and a surface receptor is required for hormone action.

A signal receptor located in the plasma membrane is generally the first component of a signal-transduction pathway, a series of molecular changes that converts an extracellular chemical signal to a specific intracellular response. You may wish to review the molecules and mechanisms of cell signaling in Chapter 11. Depending on the signal molecule and the molecules present in a target cell, a signal-transduction pathway may lead to responses in either the cytoplasm (the activation of an enzyme, for instance) or the nucleus (usually involving the regulation of specific genes). And because different types of cells have different collections of molecules (especially proteins), the same signal can bring about different responses in different target cells (FIGURE 45.4). Hormones are especially potent regulators, effective in minute amounts, and signal-transduction pathways can trigger elaborate enzyme cascades that amplify the hormonal signal (see FIGURE 11.16).

Fig 45-4. One chemical signal, different effects. A single type of signal molecule, in this case a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, can produce different responses in different target cells. Different responses may result because the receptors are different [compare (a) with (b) and (c)] or because signal-transduction pathways within the target cells are different (see also FIGURE 11.18).





 Steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and some local regulators enter target cells and bind to intracellular receptors

The first indication that some hormones do enter their target cells came from the study of the vertebrate hormones estrogen and progesterone. In most mammals, including humans, these steroid hormones are necessary for the normal development and function of the female reproductive system. In the early 1960s, researchers demonstrated that cells in the reproductive tract of female rats accumulate estrogen. The hormone was found within the nuclei of these cells, but not in the cells of such tissues as the spleen, which do not respond to estrogen. Progesterone also enters the nuclei of target cells. Such observations led to the hypothesis that cells sensitive to a steroid hormone contain internal receptor molecules that bind specifically to that hormone. We now know that intracellular proteins are the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, the hormonal form of vitamin D, and some local regulators, such as NO--all small nonpolar molecules that pass easily through cell membranes. Most intracellular receptors are located in the nucleus (see FIGURE 45.3b); others are in the cytoplasm, at least initially (see FIGURE 11.10).

Intracellular receptor proteins usually perform the entire task of transducing the signal within the cell. The chemical signal activates the receptor, which then directly triggers the cell's response. In almost all cases, the intracellular receptor activated by a hormone is a transcription factor, and the response is a change in gene expression. The active form of the factor--the hormone-receptor complex--binds to specific sites in the cell's DNA and either stimulates or represses the transcription of specific genes (see FIGURES 17.7 and 19.9). Newly made mRNA is then translated into new protein in the cytoplasm.

The arthropod molting hormone ecdysone (see FIGURE 45.2) is an example of a steroid that brings about the synthesis of new proteins. Ecdysone causes certain cells of an arthropod to synthesize the enzymes that catalyze the production of a new exoskeleton. In another example, estrogen induces cells in the reproductive system of a female bird to synthesize large amounts of ovalbumin, the main protein of egg white.

As with hormones that bind to cell-surface receptors, hormones that bind to intracellular receptors may have different effects on different target cells within an animal. For example, the estrogen that stimulates a bird's reproductive system to make ovalbumin causes its liver to make other proteins. And from that example you can see that the same hormone may have different effects in different species--human females do not respond to estrogen by making ovalbumin! Another example of a species difference in hormone response involves thyroxine, a thyroid hormone. In human and other vertebrates, thyroxine is responsible for metabolic regulation. But in frogs, thyroxine also triggers the metamorphosis of a tadpole into an adult, stimulating resorption of the tadpole's tail and other changes.





 The hypothalamus and pituitary integrate many functions of the vertebrate endocrine system

The hypothalamus plays an important role in integrating the vertebrate endocrine and nervous systems. This region of the lower brain receives information from nerves throughout the body and from other parts of the brain, then initiates endocrine signals appropriate to environmental conditions. In many vertebrates, for example, the brain passes sensory information about seasonal changes and the availability of a mate to the hypothalamus by means of nerve signals; the hypothalamus then triggers the release of reproductive hormones required for breeding.

The hormone-releasing cells in the hypothalamus are two sets of neurosecretory cells whose secretions are stored in or regulate the activity of the pituitary gland, a small organ with multiple endocrine functions. The pituitary gland was formerly called the "master gland" because so many of its hormones regulate other endocrine functions. However, the pituitary itself obeys hormonal orders from the hypothalamus.

No organ illustrates the close structural, functional, and developmental relationships of the endocrine and nervous systems better than the pituitary gland. Located at the base of the hypothalamus, it has two discrete parts that develop from two separate regions of the embryo and have very different functions (FIGURE 45.6). The anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, develops from a fold of tissue at the roof of the embryonic mouth that grows upward toward the brain and eventually loses its connection to the mouth. The anterior pituitary consists of endocrine cells that synthesize and secrete several hormones directly into the blood. A set of neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus exerts control over the anterior pituitary by secreting two kinds of hormones into the blood. Releasing hormones make the anterior pituitary secrete its hormones. Inhibiting hormones from the hypothalamus make the anterior pituitary stop secreting hormone.

Fig 45-6. Hormones of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain and surrounded by bone, consists of the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) and the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis). Note that the posterior pituitary is actually an extension of the hypothalamus.

The hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are released into capillaries in a region at the base of the hypothalamus (FIGURE 45.6b). The capillaries drain into portal vessels, which are short blood vessels that subdivide into a second capillary bed within the anterior pituitary. In this way, the hypothalamic hormones have direct access to the gland they control. Every anterior pituitary hormone is controlled by at least one releasing hormone, and some have both a releasing hormone and an inhibiting hormone.

Unlike the anterior pituitary, the posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis, is an extension of the brain. It develops from a small bulge of the hypothalamus that grows downward toward the mouth fold that forms the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary remains an extension of the hypothalamus. It stores and secretes two hormones that are made by a set of neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus.

Posterior Pituitary Hormones

The two hormones released by the posterior pituitary, oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), are made by the hypothalamus. Oxytocin acts on muscles of the uterus and ADH acts on the kidneys, rather than affecting other endocrine glands. Oxytocin induces contraction of the uterine muscles during childbirth and causes the mammary glands to eject milk during nursing. ADH acts on the kidneys, increasing water retention and thus decreasing urine volume.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is part of an elaborate feedback scheme that helps regulate the osmolarity of the blood. This mechanism was introduced in Chapter 44, but it is worth reviewing here to illustrate how hormones contribute to homeostasis and how negative feedback controls hormone levels. Blood osmolarity is monitored by a group of nerve cells that function as osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. When the osmolarity of the plasma increases, these cells shrink slightly (due to osmosis) and transmit nerve impulses to certain neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. These cells respond by releasing ADH from their tips, which are located in the posterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary stores ADH and releases it into the general circulation. When ADH reaches the kidneys, it binds to receptors on the surface of the cells lining the collecting ducts. This binding activates a signal-transduction pathway that increases the water permeability of the collecting duct. Water exits the collecting ducts and enters nearby capillaries, helping prevent a further increase in blood osmolarity above the set point. The brain's osmoreceptors also stimulate a thirst drive, and drinking water brings blood osmolarity back down to the set point. Thus, the hormonal reaction to high blood osmolarity is augmented by a behavioral response controlled by the nervous system. As the more dilute blood arrives at the brain, the hypothalamus responds to the reduction in osmolarity by slowing the release of ADH and diminishing the sensation of thirst. The effects of these hormonal and behavioral responses--increased water reabsorption in the kidneys and drinking, respectively--prevent overcompensation by shutting off further secretion of the hormone and quenching thirst. We see once again how negative feedback helps maintain homeostasis. This example also highlights the central role of the hypothalamus as a member of both the endocrine system and the nervous system.

Anterior Pituitary Hormones

The anterior pituitary produces many different hormones. Four of these are tropic hormones that stimulate the synthesis and release of hormones from other endocrine glands. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates the release of thyroid hormones; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) controls the adrenal cortex; and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) govern reproduction by acting on the gonads. Other hormones produced by the anterior pituitary are growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the endorphins.

Growth hormone (GH), a protein of about 200 amino acids, affects a wide variety of target tissues and has both direct effects and tropic effects. GH promotes growth directly and stimulates the production of growth factors. For example, the ability of GH to stimulate the growth of bones and cartilage is partly due to the hormone's signaling the liver to produce insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), which circulate in blood plasma and directly stimulate bone and cartilage growth. (This endocrine response to growth hormone qualifies GH as a tropic hormone. And IGF secretion by the liver qualifies that organ as an endocrine gland, among its many other functions.) In the absence of GH, skeletal growth of an immature animal will stop. If GH is injected into an animal that has been deprived of its own GH, growth will be partially restored.

Several human growth disorders are related to abnormal GH production. Excessive production of GH during development can lead to gigantism, while excessive GH production during adulthood results in the abnormal growth of bones in the hands, feet, and head, a condition known as acromegaly. Deficient GH production in childhood can lead to pituitary dwarfism. Children with GH deficiency have been treated successfully with human growth hormones isolated from cadaver pituitaries. However, the supply falls short of demand, and growth hormones from most other animals are ineffective. One of the most dramatic achievements of genetic engineering has been the production of GH by bacteria with genes for human GH spliced into their genomes (see Chapter 20). The product is now being used to treat children with hypopituitary dwarfism. Some athletes take GH (legally or illegally) to build muscles.

Prolactin (PRL) is a protein so similar to GH that it is believed that their genes that evolved from the same ancestral gene. The physiological roles of these two hormones, however, are different. Prolactin's most remarkable characteristic is the great diversity of effects it produces in different vertebrate species. For example, PRL stimulates mammary gland growth and milk synthesis in mammals; regulates fat metabolism and reproduction in birds; delays metamorphosis in amphibians, where it may also function as a larval growth hormone; and regulates salt and water balance in freshwater fishes. This list suggests that prolactin is an ancient hormone whose functions have diversified during the evolution of the various vertebrate classes.

Three of the tropic hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary are closely related chemically. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are all similar glycoproteins, protein molecules with carbohydrate attached to them. FSH and LH are also called gonadotropins because they stimulate the activities of the male and female gonads, the testes and ovaries. TSH stimulates the production of hormones by the thyroid gland.

The remaining hormones from the anterior pituitary are all made from a single parent molecule called pro-opiomelanocortin. This is a large protein that is cleaved into several short fragments inside anterior pituitary cells. At least three of these fragments are active peptide hormones. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the production and secretion of steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex. As described earlier, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) regulates the activity of pigment-containing cells in the skin of some vertebrates. MSH secreted by the mammalian pituitary seems to play a key role in fat metabolism, probably by a feedback mechanism that targets neurons in the hypothalamus. The other derivatives of pro-opiomelanocortin are a class of hormones called endorphins. These molecules are also produced by certain neurons in the brain. They are sometimes called the body's natural opiates because they inhibit the perception of pain. In fact, heroin and other opiate drugs mimic endorphins and bind to the same receptors in the brain. Some researchers speculate that the so-called runner's high results partly from the release of endorphins when stress and pain in the body reach critical levels. (Endorphins are discussed further in Chapter 48.)





 The pineal gland is involved in biorhythms

The pineal gland is a small mass of tissue near the center of the mammalian brain (closer to the brain surface in some other vertebrates). Although we know considerably more about the pineal than we did when Descartes described it as the seat of the soul, there is much more to learn. The pineal secretes the hormone melatonin, a modified amino acid. Depending on the species, the pineal contains light-sensitive cells or has nervous connections from the eyes, and melatonin regulates functions related to light and to seasons marked by changes in day length. For example, melatonin, like melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), affects skin pigmentation in many vertebrates. Most of the pineal's functions, though, are related to biological rhythms associated with reproduction. Melatonin is secreted at night, and the amount secreted depends on the length of the night. In winter, for example, the days are short and the nights are long, so more melatonin is secreted. Thus, melatonin production is a link between a biological clock and daily or seasonal activities, such as reproduction. Recent evidence suggests that the main target cells of melatonin are in the part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which functions as a biological clock. Melatonin seems to decrease the activity of neurons in the SCN, and this may be related to its role in mediating rhythms. However, much remains to be learned about the precise role of melatonin and about biological clocks in general.





 Thyroid hormones function in development, bioenergetics, and homeostasis

In humans and other mammals, the thyroid gland consists of two lobes located on the ventral surface of the trachea (see FIGURE 42.22a). In many other vertebrates the two halves of the gland are separated on the two sides of the pharynx. The thyroid gland produces two very similar hormones derived from the amino acid tyrosine: triiodothyronine (T3), which contains three iodine atoms, and tetraiodothyronine, or thyroxine (T4), which contains four iodine atoms (FIGURE 45.7). In mammals, the thyroid secretes mainly T4, but target cells convert most of it to T3. T3 has greater affinity for the hormone receptor, which is located in the cell nucleus. Thus it is mostly T3 that brings about responses in target cells. The secretion of thyroid hormones is controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary in a complex negative feedback system (FIGURE 45.8).

Fig 45-7. Two thyroid hormones. Structurally identical, except that T3 has three iodine atoms and T4 has four, these hormones regulate metabolism in most body cells. The thyroid secretes mainly T4, most of which is converted to T3 by an enzyme in target cells. T3 binds more avidly than T4 to receptors in the target cells.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 45-8. Feedback control loops regulating the secretion of thyroid hormones T3 and T4. The hypothalamus secretes TRH (TSH-releasing hormone), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). When TSH binds to specific receptors in the thyroid gland, a signal-transduction pathway involving cAMP as a second messenger triggers the synthesis and release of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. The system is balanced by negative feedback loops. In the two main ones (red arrows), high levels of T3, T4, and TSH in the blood inhibit TRH secretion by the hypothalamus.

The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in vertebrate development and maturation. A striking example is the thyroid's control of metamorphosis of a tadpole into a frog, which involves massive reorganization of many different tissues. The thyroid is equally important in human development. An inherited condition of thyroid deficiency known as cretinism results in markedly retarded skeletal growth and poor mental development. These defects can often be overcome, at least partially, if treatment with thyroid hormones is begun early in life. Studies with nonhuman animals have shown that thyroid hormones are required for the normal functioning of bone-forming cells and for the branching of nerve cells during embryonic development of the brain.

The thyroid gland also plays a vital role in homeostasis. In adult mammals, for instance, thyroid hormones help maintain normal blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone, digestion, and reproductive functions. Throughout the body, T3 and T4 are important in bioenergetics, generally increasing the rate of oxygen consumption and cellular metabolism. Too much or too little of these hormones in the blood can result in serious metabolic disorders. For example, in humans, an excessive secretion of thyroid hormones, known as hyperthyroidism, produces such symptoms as high body temperature, profuse sweating, weight loss, irritability, and high blood pressure. The opposite condition, hypothyroidism, can cause cretinism in infants and produce symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, and intolerance to cold in adults.

Another condition associated with a shortage of thyroid hormones is an enlargement of the thyroid called goiter, often caused by a deficiency of iodine in the diet. The feedback system shown in FIGURE 45.8 explains why iodine deficiencies lead to goiter. In the absence of sufficient iodine, the thyroid gland cannot synthesize adequate amounts of T3 and T4. Consequently, the pituitary continues to secrete TSH, leading to an enlargement of the thyroid.

In addition to having cells that secrete T3 and T4, the mammalian thyroid gland contains endocrine cells that secrete calcitonin. This hormone lowers calcium (Ca2+) levels in the blood as part of calcium homeostasis, described in the next section.





 Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin balance blood calcium

The four parathyroid glands, embedded in the surface of the thyroid, function in the homeostasis of calcium ions. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which raises blood levels of Ca2+ and thus has an effect opposite to that of the thyroid hormone calcitonin. A lack of PTH causes blood levels of calcium to drop dramatically, leading to convulsive contractions of the skeletal muscles. If unchecked, this condition, known as tetany, is fatal. Calcium ions, in appropriate concentration, are essential to the normal functioning of all cells.

PTH raises the level of blood Ca2+ by direct and indirect effects on bone and kidney. In bone, PTH induces specialized cells called osteoclasts to decompose the mineralized matrix of bone and release Ca2+ to the blood. In the kidneys, PTH has two effects: It stimulates reabsorption of Ca2+ through the renal tubules, and it activates the conversion of vitamin D to its active form. An inactive form of vitamin D, a steroid-derived molecule, is obtained from food or synthesized in the skin and then activated sequentially in the liver and the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D functions as a hormone. It acts in concert with PTH in bone, and it also affects the intestines, where it stimulates the uptake of Ca2+ from food. For hormonal action, vitamin D binds to receptors in the nuclei of target cells and regulates gene transcription.

When blood calcium rises above a certain level, calcitonin comes into play. It has effects on bone and kidneys opposite to those of PTH and thus decreases blood Ca2+. The control of blood calcium level is an example of how homeostasis is often maintained by the balancing of two antagonistic hormones--in this case, PTH and calcitonin. In classic feedback fashion, these two hormones balance each other's effects, thereby minimizing fluctuations in the concentration of calcium in the blood (FIGURE 45.9).

Fig 45-9. Hormonal control of calcium homeostasis in mammals. A negative feedback system involving two antagonistic hormones, calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH), maintains the concentration of calcium in blood very close to 10 mg/100mL. A rise in blood Ca2+ induces the thyroid gland to secrete calcitonin, which lowers the Ca2+ concentration by increasing bone deposition and reducing reabsorption in the kidneys. (By interfering with PTH, the calcitonin also helps reduce Ca2+ uptake by the intestines, not shown.) These effects are reversed by PTH, which is secreted from the parathyroid glands when the concentration of blood Ca2+ falls below the set point. Blood calcium levels begin to increase as target cells in the bones and kidneys respond to PTH. In addition to stimulating Ca2+ uptake in these organs directly, PTH also acts indirectly by helping activate vitamin D in the kidneys. The active form of vitamin D then stimulates the intestines to increase Ca2+ uptake from food. But blood Ca2+ will rise only so far before the thyroid counters by secreting more calcitonin.





 Endocrine tissues of the pancreas secrete insulin and glucagon, antagonistic hormones that regulate blood glucose

The pancreas is one of many organs that perform both endocrine and exocrine functions. Endocrine cells make up only 1-2%  of the weight of the pancreas. The rest of the organ is exocrine tissue that produces bicarbonate ions and digestive enzymes that are carried to the small intestine via the pancreatic duct (see FIGURE 41.16). Scattered among this exocrine tissue are the islets of Langerhans, clusters of endocrine cells that secrete two major hormones directly into the circulatory system. Each islet has a population of alpha cells, which secrete the peptide hormone glucagon, and a population of beta cells, which secrete the hormone insulin.

Insulin and glucagon are antagonistic hormones that regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. This is a critical bioenergetic and homeostatic function, because glucose is a major fuel for cellular respiration and a key source of carbon skeletons for the synthesis of other organic compounds. Metabolic balance depends on the maintenance of blood glucose at a concentration near a set point, which is about 90 mg/100 mL in humans. When blood glucose exceeds this level, insulin is released and acts to lower the glucose concentration. When blood glucose drops below the set point, glucagon increases glucose concentration. By negative feedback, blood glucose concentration determines the relative amounts of insulin and glucagon secreted by the islet cells (FIGURE 45.10, p. 968).

Fig 45-10. Glucose homeostasis maintained by insulin and glucagon. A rise in blood glucose above the set point (about 90 mg/100 mL in humans) stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin, which triggers its target cells to take up the excess glucose from the blood. Once the excess is removed and blood glucose concentration dips below the set point, the pancreas responds by secreting glucagon, which acts on the liver to raise the blood glucose level.

Insulin and glucagon both influence blood glucose concentration by multiple mechanisms. Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating virtually all body cells except those of the brain to take up glucose from the blood. (Brain cells are unusual in being able to take up glucose without insulin; as a result, the brain has access to circulating fuel molecules almost all the time.) Insulin also decreases blood glucose by slowing glycogen breakdown in the liver and inhibiting the conversion of amino acids and glycerol (from fats) to sugar.

The liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissues store large amounts of fuel molecules and are especially important in bioenergetics. The liver and muscles store sugar as glycogen, whereas adipose tissue cells convert sugars to fats. The liver is a key fuel-processing center because only liver cells are sensitive to glucagon. Normally, glucagon starts having an effect before blood glucose levels even drop below the set point. In fact, as soon as excess glucose is cleared from the blood, glucagon signals the liver cells to increase glycogen hydrolysis, convert amino acids and glycerol to glucose, and start slowly releasing glucose back into the circulation.

The antagonistic effects of glucagon and insulin are vital to glucose homeostasis, a mechanism that precisely manages both fuel storage and fuel use by body cells. We will revisit the topic of fuel management and see that it involves additional hormones when we study the adrenal glands in the next section. The liver's ability to perform its vital roles in glucose homeostasis results from the metabolic versatility of its cells and its access to absorbed nutrients via the hepatic portal vessel, which carries blood directly from the small intestine to the liver.

When the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis go awry, there are serious consequences. Diabetes mellitus, perhaps the best-known endocrine disorder, is caused by a deficiency of insulin or a loss of response to insulin in target tissues. The result is high blood glucose--so high, in fact, that the diabetic's kidneys excrete glucose, which explains why the presence of sugar in urine is one test for diabetes. As more glucose concentrates in the urine, more water is excreted with it, resulting in excessive volumes of urine and persistent thirst. (Diabetes, from the Greek, refers to this copious urination, and mellitus is from the Greek word for "honey," referring to the presence of sugar in the urine.) Because glucose is unavailable to most body cells as a major fuel source for diabetics, fat must serve as the main substrate for cellular respiration. In severe cases of diabetes, acidic metabolites formed during fat breakdown accumulate in the blood, threatening life by lowering blood pH.

There are actually two major forms of diabetes with very different causes. Type I diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent diabetes) is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system mounts an attack on the cells of the pancreas. (Chapter 43 discusses possible causes of autoimmune reactions.) This disorder usually occurs rather suddenly during childhood, destroying the person's ability to produce insulin. Treatment consists of insulin injections, which are usually taken several times daily. Until recently, insulin for injections was extracted from animal pancreases, but genetic engineering has provided a relatively inexpensive source of human insulin by inserting DNA encoding the hormone into bacteria (see FIGURE 20.1). Type II diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) is characterized either by a deficiency of insulin or, more commonly, by reduced responsiveness in target cells due to some change in insulin receptors. Type II diabetes usually occurs after about age 40, becoming more likely with increasing age. More than 90%  of diabetics are type II, and many can manage their blood glucose solely by exercise and dietary control, although helpful drugs are now available. Both heredity and obesity are major factors in type II diabetes.





 The adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex help the body manage stress

The adrenal glands are adjacent to the kidneys. In mammals, each adrenal gland is actually made up of two glands with different cell types, functions, and embryonic origins: the adrenal cortex, or outer portion, and the adrenal medulla, or central part. Nonmammalian vertebrates have quite different arrangements of the same tissues.

The adrenal medulla has close developmental and functional ties with the nervous system. Secretory cells of the adrenal medulla are derived from cells of the neural crest (see FIGURE 34.6). Some of the neural crest cells in the abdominal region of a vertebrate embryo may differentiate into either endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla or neurons, depending on chemical signals in the vicinity (FIGURE 45.11).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 45-11. Derivation of endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla and neurons from neural crest cells. Studies of neural crest cells in laboratory cultures indicate that the fate of these cells in embryonic vertebrates depends on chemical signals. Embryonic chicken neural crest cells that have migrated to the region of the body where the adrenal glands develop may differentiate into hormone-secreting cells of the adrenal medulla if they are given glucocorticoids (hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex). If the same neural crest cells are exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF), they develop into nerve cells called sympathetic neurons (you'll learn about the function of these neurons in Chapter 48).

What makes your heart beat faster and your skin develop goose bumps when you sense danger or approach a stressful situation, like speaking in public? These reactions are part of the fight-or-flight response stimulated by two hormones of the adrenal medulla, epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These hormones are members of a class of compounds, the catecholamines, that are synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine (FIGURE 45.12).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 45-12. The synthesis of catecholamine hormones. Cells in the adrenal medulla synthesize the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine from the amino acid tyrosine.

Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and other catecholamines are secreted in response to positive or negative stress--everything from extreme pleasure to increased cold to life-threatening danger. Their release into the blood gives the body a rapid bioenergetic boost, increasing the basal metabolic rate and having dramatic effects on several targets. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase the rate of glycogen breakdown in the liver and skeletal muscles and glucose release into the blood by liver cells. They also stimulate the release of fatty acids from fat cells. The fatty acids may be used by cells for energy. In addition to increasing the availability of energy sources, epinephrine and norepinephrine have profound effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. For example, they increase both the rate and the stroke volume of the heartbeat and dilate the bronchioles in the lungs, effects that increase the rate of oxygen delivery to body cells. (This is why doctors prescribe epinephrine as a heart stimulant and to open breathing tubes during asthma attacks.) The catecholamines also cause smooth muscles of some blood vessels to contract and muscles of other vessels to relax, with an overall effect of shunting blood away from the skin, digestive organs, and kidneys while increasing the blood supply to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles.

What causes the release of catecholamines during the response to stress? The adrenal medulla is under the control of nerve cells from the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (discussed in Chapter 48). When nerve cells are excited by some form of stressful stimulus, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the adrenal medulla. Acetylcholine combines with receptors on the cells, stimulating the release of epinephrine. Norepinephrine is released independently of epinephrine. Its functions are similar to those of epinephrine, but its primary role is in sustaining blood pressure, while epinephrine generally has a stronger effect on heart and metabolic rates. Norepinephrine also functions as an important neurotransmitter in the nervous system, as we will see in Chapter 48.

The adrenal cortex, like the adrenal medulla, reacts to stress. But it responds to endocrine signals rather than to nervous input. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to secrete a releasing hormone that stimulates the anterior pituitary to release the tropic hormone ACTH. When it reaches its target via the bloodstream, ACTH stimulates cells of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete a family of steroids called corticosteroids. In another case of negative feedback, elevated levels of corticosteroids in the blood suppress the secretion of ACTH.

Many corticosteroids have been isolated from the adrenal cortex. The two main types in humans are the glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, and the mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone (FIGURE 45.13).

Fig 45-13. Steroid hormones from the adrenal cortex and gonads. (a) Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) and aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid), both made in the adrenal cortex, are structurally similar to (b) the sex hormones testosterone (an androgen), estradiol (an estrogen), and progesterone (a progestin). The precursor for the synthesis of all steroid hormones is cholesterol (see FIGURE 5.14). Most of the androgens (male hormones) that circulate in the blood are made by the testes, and most of the estrogens and progestins (female hormones) are produced by the ovaries; however, small amounts of these sex hormones are also made by the adrenal cortex.

The primary effect of glucocorticoids is on bioenergetics, specifically on glucose metabolism. Augmenting the fuel-mobilizing effects of glucagon from the pancreas, glucocorticoids promote the synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources, such as proteins, making more glucose available as fuel. Glucocorticoids act on skeletal muscle, causing a breakdown of muscle proteins. The resulting carbon skeletons are transported to the liver and kidney, where they are converted to glucose and released into the blood. The synthesis of glucose from muscle proteins is a homeostatic mechanism providing circulating fuel when body activities require more than the liver can mobilize from its glycogen stores. It can also be part of a broader role of the glucocorticoids, that of helping the body withstand long-term environmental challenge.

Abnormally high doses of glucocorticoids administered as medication suppress certain components of the body's immune system--for example, the inflammatory reaction that occurs at the site of an infection. Glucocorticoids are used to treat diseases in which excessive inflammation is a problem. Cortisone, for instance, was once thought to be a miracle drug that could cure serious inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. It has become clear, however, that long-term use of corticosteroids can result in increased susceptibility to infection and disease because of the immunosuppressive effects of these powerful drugs.

Mineralocorticoids have their major effects on salt and water balance. Aldosterone, for example, stimulates cells in the kidney to reabsorb sodium ions and water from the filtrate, raising blood pressure and volume. Aldosterone (of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS), ADH from the posterior pituitary, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from the heart form a regulatory complex with multiple feedback loops that underlie the kidney's ability to maintain the ion and water homeostasis of the blood (see FIGURE 44.21). Aldosterone secretion is largely regulated by the RAAS itself in response to changes in plasma ion concentration. However, when an individual is under severe stress, the hypothalamus tends to secrete more releasing hormones that increase the rate of secretion of ACTH by the anterior pituitary. The rise in ACTH in the blood then increases the rate of secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex.

Evidence is mounting that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids help maintain homeostasis when the body experiences stress over an extended period of time. FIGURE 45.14 compares the long-term stress-induced actions of corticosteroids with the short-term ones of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Fig 45-14. Stress and the adrenal gland. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to activate the adrenal medulla via nerve impulses and the adrenal cortex via hormonal signals. The adrenal medulla mediates short-term responses to stress by secreting the catecholamine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. The adrenal cortex controls more prolonged responses by secreting steroid hormones.

A third group of corticosteroids are sex hormones, mainly androgens (male hormones) similar to testosterone produced by the testes and small amounts of estrogens and progesterone (female hormones). There is evidence that adrenal androgens account for the sex drive in adult females, but otherwise the physiological roles of the adrenal sex hormones are not well understood. We will discuss the sex hormones from the gonads in the next section.





 Gonadal steroids regulate growth, development, reproductive cycles, and sexual behavior

The gonads produce and secrete three major categories of steroid hormones: androgens, estrogens, and progestins (see FIGURE 45.13). All three types are found in both males and females but in different proportions. Produced in the testes of males and ovaries of females, these steroids affect growth and development and also regulate reproductive cycles and sexual behavior.

The testes primarily synthesize androgens, the main such hormone being testosterone. In general, androgens stimulate the development and maintenance of the male reproductive system. Androgens produced early in the development of an embryo determine that the fetus will develop as a male rather than a female. At puberty, high concentrations of androgens are responsible for the development of human male secondary sex characteristics, such as male patterns of hair growth and a low voice.

Estrogens, the most important of which is estradiol, have a parallel role in the maintenance of the female reproductive system and the development of female secondary sex characteristics. In mammals, progestins, which include progesterone, are primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus, which supports the growth and development of an embryo.

The synthesis of both estrogens and androgens is controlled by gonadotropins, FSH and LH, from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH and LH secretion is controlled by one releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). We will examine the complex feedback relationships that regulate the secretion of gonadal steroids in detail in Chapter 46. There we will see that the endocrine system is central not only to the survival of the individual but also to the propagation of the species.

The many aspects of animal form and function we have studied so far can be viewed, in the broadest context, as adaptations contributing to reproductive success. Individuals are transient. A population transcends finite life spans only by reproduction, the creation of new individuals from existing ones. The two earthworms in the photograph above are mating. Unless disturbed, they will remain above the ground and joined like this for several hours. Each worm produces both sperm and eggs, each donates and receives sperm during mating, and each will produce fertilized eggs. In a few weeks, sexual reproduction will be completed when many new individuals hatch from the eggs.

Animal reproduction is the subject of this chapter. We will first compare the diverse reproductive mechanisms that have evolved in the animal kingdom, and then examine the details of mammalian, particularly human, reproduction.

The mechanisms of fertilization, the union of sperm and egg, play an important part in sexual reproduction. Some species have external fertilization; eggs are shed by the female and fertilized by the male in the environment (FIGURE 46.4). Other species have internal fertilization; sperm are deposited in or near the female reproductive tract, and fertilization occurs within the tract. (The cellular and molecular details of fertilization are discussed in Chapter 47.)

Fig 46-4. The release of eggs and external fertilization. Many amphibians shed gametes into the environment, and fertilization occurs outside the female's body. In most species, behavioral adaptations ensure that a male is present when the female releases eggs. Here, a female frog, clasped by a male (on top), has just released a mass of eggs. The male released sperm (not shown) at the same time, and external fertilization has already occurred in the surrounding water.

 Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur in the animal kingdom

There are two principal modes of animal reproduction. Asexual (from the Greek, "without sex") reproduction is the creation of new individuals whose genes all come from one parent without the fusion of egg and sperm. In most cases, asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is the creation of offspring by the fusion of haploid gametes to form a zygote (fertilized egg), which is diploid. Gametes are formed by meiosis (see FIGURE 13.7). The female gamete, the ovum (unfertilized egg), is usually a relatively large and nonmotile cell. The male gamete, the spermatozoon, is generally a small, motile cell. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variability among offspring by generating unique combinations of genes inherited from two parents. By producing offspring having various phenotypes, sexual reproduction may enhance the reproductive success of parents when pathogens or other environmental factors change relatively rapidly.





 Diverse mechanisms of asexual reproduction enable animals to produce identical offspring rapidly

Many invertebrates can reproduce asexually by fission, the separation of a parent into two or more individuals of approximately equal size (FIGURE 46.1). Also common among invertebrates, budding involves new individuals splitting off from existing ones. For example, in certain cnidarians and tunicates, new individuals grow out from the body of a parent (see FIGURE 13.1). The offspring may either detach from the parent or remain joined, eventually forming extensive colonies. Stony corals, which may be more than 1 m across, are cnidarian colonies of several thousand connected individuals. In another form of asexual reproduction, some invertebrates release specialized groups of cells that can grow into new individuals. For example, the gemmules of sponges are formed when cells of several types migrate together within the sponge and become surrounded by a protective coat.

Fig 46-1. Two from one: asexual reproduction of a sea anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima). The individual in the center of this photograph is undergoing fission, a type of asexual reproduction. Two smaller individuals will soon form as the parent divides approximately in half. The offspring will be genetic copies of the parent.

Yet another type of asexual reproduction is fragmentation, the breaking of the body into several pieces, some or all of which develop into complete adults. For an animal to reproduce this way, fragmentation must be accompanied by regeneration, the regrowth of lost body parts. Reproduction by fragmentation and regeneration occurs in many sponges, cnidarians, polychaete annelids, and tunicates. Many animals can also replace lost appendages by regeneration--most sea stars can grow new arms when injured, for example--but this is not reproduction because new individuals are not created. In sea stars of the genus Linckia, a whole new individual may develop from an isolated arm. Thus, a single animal with five arms, if broken apart, could asexually give rise to five offspring.

Asexual reproduction has several potential advantages. For instance, it enables animals living in isolation to produce offspring without locating mates. It can also create numerous offspring in a short amount of time, which is ideal for colonizing a habitat rapidly. Theoretically, asexual reproduction is most advantageous in stable, favorable environments because it perpetuates successful genotypes precisely.





 Reproductive cycles and patterns vary extensively among animals

Most animals show definite cycles in reproductive activity, often related to changing seasons. The periodic nature of reproduction allows animals to conserve resources and reproduce when more energy is available than is needed for maintenance and when environmental conditions favor the survival of offspring. Ewes (female sheep), for example, have 15-day reproductive cycles and ovulate at the midpoint of each cycle. These cycles generally occur during fall and early winter, so lambs are usually born in the late winter or spring. Even animals that live in apparently stable habitats, such as the tropics or the ocean, generally reproduce only at certain times of the year. Reproductive cycles are controlled by a combination of hormonal and environmental cues, the latter including such factors as seasonal temperature, rainfall, day length, and lunar cycles (see the discussion of the pineal gland in Chapter 45).

Animals may reproduce asexually or sexually exclusively, or they may alternate between the two modes. In aphids, rotifers, and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia, each female can produce eggs of two types, depending on environmental conditions such as the time of year. One type of egg is fertilized, but the other type develops by parthenogenesis, a process in which the egg develops without being fertilized. The adults produced by parthenogenesis are often haploid, and eggs are formed without meiosis. In the case of Daphnia, the switch from sexual to asexual reproduction is often related to season. Asexual reproduction occurs under favorable conditions and sexual reproduction during times of environmental stress.

Parthenogenesis has a role in the social organization of certain species of bees, wasps, and ants. Male honeybees, or drones, are produced parthenogenetically, whereas females, both sterile workers and reproductive females (queens), develop from fertilized eggs.

Among vertebrates, several genera of fishes, amphibians, and lizards reproduce exclusively by a complex form of parthenogenesis that involves the doubling of chromosomes after meiosis to create diploid "zygotes." For example, there are about 15 species of whiptail lizards (genus Cnemidophorus) that reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. There are no males in these species, but the lizards imitate courtship and mating behavior typical of sexual species of the same genus. During the breeding season, one female of each mating pair mimics a male (FIGURE 46.2a). The roles change two or three times during the season, female behavior occurring when the level of the female sex hormone estrogen is high prior to ovulation (the release of eggs), and male behavior occurring after ovulation when the level of estrogen drops (FIGURE 46.2b). In fact, ovulation is more likely to occur if one individual is mounted by another during the critical time of the hormone cycle; isolated lizards lay fewer eggs than those that go through the motions of sex. Apparently, these parthenogenetic lizards, which evolved from species having two sexes, still require certain sexual stimuli for maximum reproductive success.

Fig 46-2. Sexual behavior in parthenogenetic lizards. The desert-grassland whiptail lizard (Cnemidophorus uniparens) is an all-female species. These reptiles reproduce by parthenogenesis; eggs undergo a chromosome doubling after meiosis and develop into lizards without being fertilized. However, ovulation is enhanced by courtship and mating rituals that imitate the behavior of closely related species that reproduce sexually.

Sexual reproduction presents a special problem for sessile or burrowing animals or for parasites, such as tapeworms, which may have difficulty encountering a member of the opposite sex. One solution to this problem is hermaphroditism, in which each individual has both male and female reproductive systems (the term is derived from Hermes and Aphrodite, names of a Greek god and goddess). Although some hermaphrodites fertilize themselves, most must mate with another member of the same species. When this occurs, each animal serves as both male and female, donating and receiving sperm, as we saw for earthworms. Each individual encountered is a potential mate, resulting in twice as many offspring than if only one individual's eggs were fertilized.

Another remarkable reproductive pattern is sequential hermaphroditism, in which an individual reverses its sex during its lifetime. In some species, the sequential hermaphrodite is protogynous (female first), while other species are protandrous (male first). In various species of reef fishes called wrasses, sex reversal is associated with age and size. For example, the Caribbean bluehead wrasse is a protogynous species in which only the largest (usually the oldest) individuals change from female to male (FIGURE 46.3). These fish live in harems consisting of a single male and several females. If the male dies or is removed in experiments, the largest female in the harem changes sex and becomes the new male. Within a week, the transformed individual is producing sperm instead of eggs. In this species, the male defends the harem against intruders, and thus larger size may give a greater reproductive advantage to males than it does to females. In contrast, there are protandrous animals that change from male to female when size increases. In such cases, greater size may increase the reproductive success of females more than it does males. For example, the production of huge numbers of gametes is an important asset for sedentary animals, such as oysters, that release their gametes into the surrounding water. Egg cells are generally much larger than sperm cells, so females produce fewer gametes than males. Larger females tend to produce more eggs than smaller ones, and species of oysters that are sequential hermaphrodites are generally protandrous.

Fig 46-3. Sex reversal in a sequential hermaphrodite. In many species of reef fishes called wrasses, sex can change during the animal's life. Sex reversal is often correlated with size. In this scene, a male Caribbean bluehead wrasse and two smaller females are feeding on a sea urchin. All wrasses of this species are born females, but the oldest, largest individuals change sex and complete their lives as males.

The diverse reproductive cycles and patterns we observe in the animal kingdom are adaptations that have evolved by natural selection. We will see many other examples as we survey the various mechanisms of sexual reproduction.





 Internal and external fertilization both depend on mechanisms ensuring that mature sperm encounter fertile eggs of the same species

Internal fertilization requires cooperative behavior, leading to copulation. In some cases, uncharacteristic sexual behavior is eliminated by natural selection in a direct manner; for example, female spiders will eat males if specific reproductive signals are not followed during mating. (We will discuss other examples of mating behavior in Chapter 51.) Internal fertilization also requires sophisticated reproductive systems, including copulatory organs that deliver sperm and receptacles for its storage and transport to ripe eggs.

Because external fertilization requires an environment where an egg can develop without desiccation or heat stress, it occurs almost exclusively in moist habitats. Many aquatic invertebrates simply shed their eggs and sperm into the surroundings, and fertilization occurs without the parents actually making physical contact. Timing is still crucial to ensure that mature sperm encounter ripe eggs.

Many fishes and amphibians that use external fertilization exhibit specific mating behaviors, in which one male fertilizes the eggs of one female. Courtship behavior is a mutual trigger for the release of gametes, with two effects: The probability of successful fertilization is increased, and the choice of mates may be somewhat selective. Environmental cues such as temperature or day length may cause all the individuals of a population to release gametes at once, or chemical signals from one individual releasing gametes may trigger gamete release in others.

Pheromones are chemical signals released by one organism that influence the behavior of other individuals of the same species. Pheromones are small, volatile or water-soluble molecules that disperse easily into the environment and, like hormones, are active in minute amounts. Many pheromones function as mate attractants. The mate attractants of some female insects can be detected by males as much as a mile away. The pheromone of the female gypsy moth elicits behavioral responses in males at concentrations as low as 1 molecule of pheromone in 1017 molecules of other gases in the air. (We will return to pheromones in Chapter 51.)





 Species with internal fertilization usually produce fewer zygotes but provide more parental protection than species with external fertilization

All species produce more offspring than survive to reproduce. Species with external fertilization usually produce enormous numbers of zygotes, but the proportion that survive and develop further is often quite small. Internal fertilization usually produces fewer zygotes, but this may be offset by greater protection of the embryos and parental care of the young. Major types of protection include resistant eggshells, development of the embryo within the reproductive tract of the female parent, and parental care of the eggs and offspring.

Many species of terrestrial animals produce eggs that can withstand harsh environments. Birds, reptiles, and monotremes have amniote eggs with calcium and protein shells that resist water loss and physical damage. By contrast, the eggs of fishes and amphibians have only a gelatinous coat.

Rather than secreting a protective shell around the egg, many animals retain the embryo, which develops within the female reproductive tract. Among mammals, marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums retain their embryos for a short period in the uterus; the embryos then crawl out and complete fetal development attached to a mammary gland in the mother's pouch. The embryos of eutherian (placental) mammals develop entirely within the uterus, being nourished by the mother's blood supply through a special organ, the placenta (discussed in Chapter 34 and later in this chapter).

When a kangaroo crawls out of its mother's pouch for the first time, or when a human is born, it still is not capable of independent existence. We are familiar with adult birds feeding their young and mammals nursing their offspring, but parental care is much more widespread than we might suspect, and it takes a variety of unusual forms. In one species of tropical frog, for instance, the male carries the tadpoles in his stomach until they metamorphose and hop out as young frogs. There are also many cases of parental care among invertebrates (FIGURE 46.5).

Fig 46-5. Parental care in an invertebrate. Compared to many insects, giant water bugs (Belostoma) produce relatively few offspring, but parental protection enhances the survival of those offspring. Fertilization is internal, and the female glues her fertilized eggs to the back of the male (shown here). Whereas the males of most insect species provide no parental care for their offspring, the male giant water bug carries them for days, frequently fanning water over them. This treatment helps keep the eggs moist, aerated, and free of parasites.





 Complex reproductive systems have evolved in many animal phyla

To reproduce sexually, animals must have systems that produce gametes and deliver them to the gametes of the opposite sex. These reproductive systems are varied. The least complex systems do not even contain distinct gonads, the organs that produce gametes in most animals. The most complex reproductive systems contain many sets of accessory tubes and glands that carry and protect the gametes and developing embryos. Many animals whose body plans are otherwise relatively simple possess highly complex reproductive systems. The reproductive systems of parasitic flatworms, for example, are among the most complex in the animal kingdom (FIGURE 46.6).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 46-6. Reproductive anatomy of a parasitic flatworm. Most flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are hermaphroditic, with complex male and female reproductive systems. Both systems open to the outside through the genital pore. Sperm produced in the testes pass through a pair of ducts (vasa efferentia) into a single sperm duct (vas deferens) and are stored in the seminal vesicle. During copulation, sperm are ejaculated into the female system (usually of another individual) and then move through the uterus to the seminal receptacle. (In some flatworms, sperm are injected into the body tissues through the body wall and then migrate to the female reproductive tract.) Eggs from the ovary pass into the oviduct, where they are fertilized by sperm from the seminal receptacle and coated with yolk and tough shell material secreted by the yolk glands. From the oviduct, the fertilized, shelled eggs pass into the uterus from which they are shed through the genital pore. Usually only a small fraction of the eggs will develop into the next generation of adult worms.

Among the least complex systems are those of polychaete worms (phylum Annelida). Most polychaetes have separate sexes but do not have distinct gonads; rather, the eggs and sperm develop from undifferentiated cells lining the coelom. As the gametes mature, they are released from the body wall and fill the coelom. Depending on the species, mature gametes may be shed through the excretory openings, or the swelling mass of eggs may split the body open, killing the parent and spilling the eggs into the environment.

Most insects have separate sexes with complex reproductive systems (FIGURE 46.7). In the male, sperm develop in a pair of testes and are conveyed along a coiled duct to two seminal vesicles, where they are stored. During mating, sperm are ejaculated into the female reproductive system. In the female, eggs develop in a pair of ovaries and are conveyed through ducts to the vagina, where fertilization occurs. In many species the female reproductive system includes a spermatheca, a sac in which sperm may be stored for a year or more.

The basic plan of all vertebrate reproductive systems is quite similar, but there are some important variations. In many nonmammalian vertebrates, the digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems have a common opening to the outside, the cloaca, which was probably present in the ancestors of all vertebrates. By contrast, most mammals lack a cloaca and have a separate opening for the digestive tract, and most female mammals have separate openings for the excretory and reproductive systems as well. The uterus of most vertebrates is partly or completely divided into two chambers. However, in humans and other mammals that produce only a few young at a time, as well as in birds and many snakes, the uterus is a single structure. Male reproductive systems differ mainly in the copulatory organs. Many nonmammalian vertebrates do not have a well-developed penis and simply evert the cloaca to ejaculate.





 Human reproduction involves intricate anatomy and complex behavior

Reproductive Anatomy of the Human Male

In most mammalian species, including humans, the male's external reproductive organs are the scrotum and penis. The internal reproductive organs consist of gonads that produce gametes (sperm cells) and hormones, accessory glands that secrete products essential to sperm movement, and ducts that carry the sperm and glandular secretions (FIGURE 46.8).

Fig 46-8. Reproductive anatomy of the human male.

The male gonads, or testes (singular, testis), consist of many highly coiled tubes surrounded by several layers of connective tissue. These tubes are the seminiferous tubules, where sperm form. The Leydig cells scattered between the seminiferous tubules produce testosterone and other androgens.

Production of normal sperm cannot occur at the body temperatures of most mammals, and the testes of humans and many other mammals are held outside the abdominal cavity in the scrotum, which is a fold of the body wall. The temperature in a scrotum is about 2&#176;C below that in the abdominal cavity. The testes develop high in the abdominal cavity and descend into the scrotum just before birth. In many rodents, the testes are drawn back into the abdominal cavity, and sperm maturation is interrupted between breeding seasons. Some mammals whose body temperature is low enough to allow sperm maturation, such as monotremes, whales, and elephants, retain the testes within the abdominal cavity permanently.

From the seminiferous tubules of a testis, the sperm pass into the coiled tubules of the epididymis. It takes about 20 days for sperm to pass through the 6-m-long tubules of each epididymis of a human male. During this passage, the sperm become motile and gain the ability to fertilize. During ejaculation, the sperm are propelled from the epididymis through the muscular vas deferens. These two ducts (one from each epididymis) run from the scrotum around and behind the urinary bladder, where each joins a duct from the seminal vesicle, forming a short ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts open into the urethra, the tube that drains both the excretory system and the reproductive system. The urethra runs through the penis and opens to the outside at the tip of the penis.

Three sets of accessory glands (the seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands) add secretions to the semen, the fluid that is ejaculated. A pair of seminal vesicles contributes about 60%  of the total volume of the semen. The fluid from the seminal vesicles is thick, yellowish, and alkaline. It contains mucus, the sugar fructose (which provides most of the energy used by the sperm), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid, and prostaglandins, local regulators discussed in Chapter 45.

The prostate gland is the largest of the semen-secreting glands. It secretes its products directly into the urethra through several small ducts. Prostatic fluid is thin and milky, contains anticoagulant enzymes and citrate (a sperm nutrient). The prostate gland is the source of some of the most common medical problems of men over age 40. Benign (noncancerous) enlargement of the prostate occurs in more than half of all men in this age group and in virtually all men over 70. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. It is treated surgically or with drugs that inhibit gonadotropins, resulting in reduced prostate activity and size.

The bulbourethral glands are a pair of small glands along the urethra below the prostate. Before ejaculation they secrete a clear mucus that neutralizes any acidic urine remaining in the urethra. Bulbourethral fluid also carries some sperm released before ejaculation, which is one reason for the high failure rate of the withdrawal method of birth control.

A man usually ejaculates about 2 to 5 mL of semen, and each milliliter may contain about 50 to 130 million sperm. Once in the female reproductive tract, prostaglandins in the semen thin the mucus at the opening of the uterus and stimulate contractions of the uterine muscles, which help move the semen up the uterus. The semen is slightly alkaline, and this helps neutralize the acidic environment of the vagina, protecting the sperm and increasing their motility. When first ejaculated, the semen coagulates, making it easier for uterine contractions to move it along; then anticoagulants liquify the semen, and the sperm begin swimming through the female tract.

The human penis is composed of three cylinders of spongy erectile tissue derived from modified veins and capillaries. During sexual arousal, the erectile tissue fills with blood from the arteries. As this tissue fills, the increasing pressure seals off the veins that drain the penis, causing it to engorge with blood. The resulting erection is essential to insertion of the penis into the vagina. Rodents, raccoons, walruses, and several other mammals also possess a baculum, a bone that is contained in, and helps stiffen, the penis. Temporary impotence, a reversible inability to achieve an erection, can result from alcohol consumption, certain drugs, and emotional problems. Several drugs and penile implant devices are available for men with nonreversible impotence due to nervous system or circulatory problems. A new oral drug called Viagra&#174; promotes the action of the local regulator nitric oxide (NO), enhancing relaxation of smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis. This allows blood to enter the erectile tissue and sustain an erection.

The main shaft of the penis is covered by relatively thick skin. The head, or glans penis, has a much thinner covering and is consequently more sensitive to stimulation. The human glans is covered by a fold of skin called the foreskin, or prepuce, which may be removed by circumcision. Circumcision, which arose from religious traditions, has no verifiable basis in health or hygiene.

Reproductive Anatomy of the Human Female

The female's external reproductive structures are the clitoris and two sets of labia surrounding the clitoris and vaginal opening. The internal reproductive organs consist of a pair of gonads and a system of ducts and chambers to conduct the gametes and house the embryo and fetus (FIGURE 46.9).

Fig 46-9. Reproductive anatomy of the human female.

The female gonads, the ovaries, lie in the abdominal cavity, flanking, and attached by a mesentery to, the uterus. Each ovary is enclosed in a tough protective capsule and contains many follicles. A follicle consists of one egg cell surrounded by one or more layers of follicle cells, which nourish and protect the developing egg cell. All of the 400,000 follicles a woman will ever have are formed before her birth. Of these, only several hundred will release egg cells during the woman's reproductive years. Starting at puberty and continuing until menopause, usually one follicle matures and releases its egg cell during each menstrual cycle. The cells of the follicle also produce the primary female sex hormones, the estrogens. The egg cell is expelled from the follicle in the process of ovulation (FIGURE 46.10). The remaining follicular tissue then grows within the ovary to form a solid mass called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes additional estrogens and progesterone, the hormone that maintains the uterine lining during pregnancy. If the egg cell is not fertilized, the corpus luteum disintegrates, and a new follicle matures during the next cycle.

Fig 46-10. Ovulation. An egg cell is released from a follicle at the surface of the ovary. The orangish mass below the ejected egg cell is part of a mammalian ovary.

The female reproductive system is not completely closed, and the egg cell is released into the abdominal cavity near the opening of the oviduct, or fallopian tube. The oviduct has a funnel-like opening, and cilia on the inner epithelium lining the duct help collect the egg cell by drawing fluid from the body cavity into the duct. The cilia also convey the egg cell down the duct to the uterus, also known as the womb. The uterus is a thick, muscular organ that can expand during pregnancy to accommodate a 4-kg fetus. The inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is richly supplied with blood vessels.

The neck of the uterus is the cervix, which opens into the vagina. The vagina is a thin-walled chamber that forms the birth canal through which the baby is born; it is also the repository for sperm during copulation.

At birth, and usually until sexual intercourse or vigorous physical activity ruptures it, a vascularized membrane called the hymen partly covers the vaginal opening in humans. The vaginal opening and the separate urethral opening are located within a region called the vestibule, bordered by a pair of slender skin folds, the labia minora. A pair of thick, fatty ridges, the labia majora, encloses and protects the labia minora and vestibule. At the front edge of the vestibule, the clitoris consists of a short shaft supporting a rounded glans, or head, covered by a small hood of skin, the prepuce. During sexual arousal, the clitoris, vagina, and labia minora all engorge with blood and enlarge. The clitoris consists largely of erectile tissue. Richly supplied with nerve endings, it is one of the most sensitive points of sexual stimulation. During sexual arousal, Bartholin's glands, located near the vaginal opening, secrete mucus into the vestibule, keeping it lubricated and facilitating intercourse.

Mammary glands are present in both sexes but normally function only in women. They are not part of the reproductive system but are important to mammalian reproduction. Within the glands, small sacs of epithelial tissue secrete milk, which drains into a series of ducts opening at the nipple. Fatty (adipose) tissue forms the main mass of the mammary gland of a nonlactating mammal. The low level of estrogen in males prevents the development of both the secretory apparatus and the fat deposits, so male breasts remain small, and the nipples are not connected to the ducts.

Human Sexual Response

Many vertebrates and invertebrates have elaborate and complex mating behavior (see Chapter 51). Human sexuality is characterized by a diversity of stimuli and responses, with a common, underlying physiological pattern.

Two types of physiological reactions predominate in both sexes: vasocongestion, the filling of a tissue with blood caused by increased blood flow through the arteries of that tissue, and myotonia, increased muscle tension. Both skeletal and smooth muscle may show sustained or rhythmic contractions, including those associated with orgasm.

The sexual response cycle can be divided into four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. An important function of the excitement phase is preparation of the vagina and penis for coitus (sexual intercourse). During this phase, vasocongestion is particularly evident in erection of the penis and clitoris; enlargement of the testes, labia, and breasts; and vaginal lubrication. Myotonia may occur, resulting in nipple erection or tension of the arms and legs.

The plateau phase continues these responses. In females, the outer third of the vagina becomes vasocongested, while the inner two-thirds becomes slightly expanded. This change, coupled with the elevation of the uterus, forms a depression that receives sperm at the back of the vagina. Breathing increases and heart rate rises, sometimes to 150 beats per minute--not in response to the physical effort of sexual activity, but as an involuntary response to stimulation of the autonomic nervous system (see FIGURES 48.17 and FIGURES 48.18).

Orgasm is characterized by rhythmic, involuntary contractions of the reproductive structures in both sexes. Male orgasm has two stages. Emission is the contraction of the glands and ducts of the reproductive tract, which forces semen into the urethra. Expulsion, or ejaculation, occurs when the urethra contracts and the semen is expelled. During female orgasm, the uterus and outer vagina contract, but the inner two-thirds of the vagina do not. Orgasm is the shortest phase of the sexual response cycle, usually lasting only a few seconds. In members of both sexes, contractions occur at about 0.8-sec intervals and may involve the anal sphincter and several abdominal muscles.

The resolution phase completes the cycle and reverses the responses of the earlier stages. Vasocongested organs return to their normal size and color, and muscles relax. Most of the changes during resolution are completed in 5 minutes. Loss of penile and clitoral erection, however, may take longer. An initial loss of erection is rapid in both sexes, but a return of the organs to their nonaroused size may take as long as an hour.





 Spermatogenesis and oogenesis both involve meiosis but differ in three significant ways

Spermatogenesis, the production of mature sperm cells, is a continuous and prolific process in the adult male. Each ejaculation of a human male contains 100 to 650 million sperm cells, and males can ejaculate daily with little loss of fertilizing capacity.

Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. FIGURE 46.11 describes the process in some detail. The stem cells that give rise to sperm, spermatogonia, are located at the periphery of each seminiferous tubule. The developing sperm cells move toward the central opening (lumen) of the tubule as they undergo meiosis and differentiation. The four cells that results from meiosis all develop into mature sperm cells.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 46-11. Spermatogenesis. These drawings correlate the meiotic stages in sperm development (left) with the structure of seminiferous tubules at the microscopic level. Primordial germ cells of the embryonic testes differentiate into spermatogonia, the stem cells that give rise to sperm. As spermatogonia differentiate into spermatocytes and then to spermatids, meiosis reduces the chromosome number from diploid (2n = 46 in humans) to haploid (n = 23). The developing cells are gradually pushed from a location near the outer wall of the seminiferous tubule toward the lumen (central opening) and make their way to the epididymis, where they become motile. This process, from spermatogonia to motile sperm, takes 65 to 75 days in the human male. In mature males, about 3 million spermatogonia start the process each day.

The structure of a sperm cell fits its function (FIGURE 46.12). In most species, a head containing the haploid nucleus is tipped with a special body, the acrosome, which contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate the egg. Behind the head, the sperm cell contains large numbers of mitochondria (or a single large one, in some species) that provide ATP for movement of the tail, which is a flagellum. Mammalian sperm shape varies from species to species, with the head a slender comma shape, an oval form (as in the human sperm), or nearly spherical.

Fig 46-12. Structure of a human sperm cell.

Oogenesis is the development of ova--mature, unfertilized egg cells. FIGURE 46.13, p. 986, shows the process and its location, the ovary. In the developing female embryo, oogonia, the stem cells that give rise to ova, multiply and then begin meiosis, but the process stops at prophase I. The cells at this stage, called primary oocytes, remain quiescent within small follicles until puberty, when they are reactivated by hormones. Beginning at puberty, FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) periodically stimulates a follicle to grow and induces its primary oocyte to complete meiosis I and start meiosis II. Meiosis then stops again; the secondary oocyte, released during ovulation, does not continue meiosis II right away. In humans, penetration of the egg cell by the sperm triggers the completion of meiosis, and only then is oogenesis actually complete.

Fig 46-13. Oogenesis.

Oogenesis differs from spermatogenesis in three major ways. First, during the meiotic divisions of oogenesis, cytokinesis is unequal, with almost all the cytoplasm monopolized by a single daughter cell, the secondary oocyte. This large cell can go on to form the ovum; the other products of meiosis, smaller cells called polar bodies, degenerate. This contrasts with spermatogenesis, when all four products of meiosis develop into mature sperm (compare FIGURES 46.11 and FIGURES 46.13). Second, while the cells from which sperm develop continue to divide by mitosis throughout the male's life, this is not the case for oogenesis in the female. At birth, an ovary already contains all the primary oocytes it will ever have. Third, oogenesis has long "resting" periods, in contrast to spermatogenesis, which produces mature sperm from precursor cells in an uninterrupted sequence.





 A complex interplay of hormones regulates reproduction

The Male Pattern

In the male, the principal sex hormones are the androgens, of which testosterone is the most important. Androgens, steroid hormones produced mainly by the Leydig cells of the testes, are directly responsible for the primary and secondary sex characteristics of the male. Primary sex characteristics are those associated with the reproductive system: development of the vasa deferentia and other ducts, development of the external reproductive structures, and sperm production. Secondary sex characteristics are features that are not directly related to the reproductive system, including deepening of the voice, distribution of facial and pubic hair, and muscle growth (androgens stimulate protein synthesis). Androgens are also potent determinants of behavior in mammals and other vertebrates. In addition to specific sexual behaviors and sex drive, androgens increase general aggressiveness and are responsible for such actions as singing in birds and calling by frogs. Hormones from the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus control both androgen secretion and sperm production by the testes (FIGURE 46.14).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 46-14. Hormonal control of the testes. The anterior pituitary secretes two gonadotropic hormones with different effects on the testes, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH are themselves both regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. LH, FSH, and GnRH concentrations in the blood are regulated by negative feedback by androgens. GnRH is also controlled by negative feedback from LH and FSH (not shown). In human males, these feedback loops keep the hormones at relatively constant levels, but in many other mammalian species, seasonal cycles in hormone concentration regulate breeding patterns.

The Female Pattern

In the female, the pattern of hormone secretion and the reproductive events the hormones regulate are cyclic, very different from the male pattern. Whereas males produce sperm continuously, females release only one egg or a few eggs at one time during each cycle. Control of the female cycle is quite complex.

Two different types of cycles occur in female mammals. Humans and many other primates have menstrual cycles, whereas other mammals have estrous cycles. In both cases, ovulation occurs at a time in the cycle after the endometrium has started to thicken and develop a rich blood supply, which prepares the uterus for the possible implantation of an embryo. One difference between the two types of cycles involves the fate of the uterine lining if pregnancy does not occur. In menstrual cycles, the endometrium is shed from the uterus through the cervix and vagina in a bleeding called menstruation. In estrous cycles, the endometrium is reabsorbed by the uterus, and no extensive bleeding occurs.

Other major distinctions include more pronounced behavioral changes during estrous cycles than during menstrual cycles and stronger effects of season and climate on estrous cycles. Whereas human females may be receptive to sexual activity throughout their cycles, most mammals will copulate only during the period surrounding ovulation. This period of sexual activity, called estrus (from the Latin oestrus, frenzy, passion), is the only time vaginal changes permit mating. Estrus is sometimes called heat, and indeed the female's body temperature increases slightly. The length and frequency of reproductive cycles vary widely among mammals. The human menstrual cycle averages 28 days (although cycles vary, ranging from about 20 to 40 days). In contrast, the estrous cycle of the rat is only 5 days. Bears and dogs have one cycle per year, but elephants cycle several times per year.

Let's examine the reproductive cycle of the human female in more detail as a case study of how a complex function is coordinated by hormones. The term menstrual cycle refers specifically to the changes that occur in the uterus (FIGURE 46.15, p. 988). By convention, the first day of a woman's menstrual period, the first day of menstruation, is designated day 1 of the cycle. The menstrual flow phase of the cycle, during which menstrual bleeding (loss of most of the functional layer of the endometrium) occurs, usually persists for a few days (FIGURE 46.15d). Then the thin remaining endometrium begins to regenerate and thicken for a week or two, during what is called the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. During the last phase, the secretory phase, usually about two weeks in duration, the endometrium continues to thicken, becomes more vascularized, and develops glands that secrete a fluid rich in glycogen. If an embryo has not implanted in the uterine lining by the end of the secretory phase, a new menstrual flow commences, marking day 1 of the next cycle.

Fig 46-15. The reproductive cycle of the human female. Hormones coordinate the ovarian and menstrual cycles, preparing the uterine lining (endometrium) for implantation of an embryo even before ovulation. (a) Changes in LH and FSH levels. (b) Changes in the levels of estrogens and progesterone. (c) The ovarian cycle consists of a follicular phase, during which follicles grow and secrete increasing amounts of estrogens; ovulation; and a luteal phase, during which the corpus luteum secretes estrogens and progesterone. Length of the follicular phase varies; the luteal phase usually lasts 13 to 15 days. (d) The menstrual cycle consists of a menstrual flow phase, a proliferative phase, and a secretory phase. Menstruation, the shedding of the endometrium, occurs during the menstrual flow phase. The first day of flow marks day 1 of the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, estrogens from the growing follicle stimulate the endometrium to thicken and become increasingly vascularized. During the secretory phase, the endometrium continues to thicken, its arteries enlarge, and endometrial glands grow. These endometrial changes require estrogens and progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation. Thus, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle parallels the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. Disintegration of the corpus luteum at the end of the luteal phase reduces the amount of estrogens and progesterone available to the endometrium, so it is shed. In the event of pregnancy, additional mechanisms maintain high levels of estrogens and progesterone, preventing loss of the endometrium.

Paralleling the menstrual cycle is an ovarian cycle (FIGURE 46.15c). It begins with the follicular phase, during which several follicles in the ovary begin to grow. The developing egg cell in each of these follicles enlarges, and its coat of follicle cells thickens. Of the several follicles that start to grow, however, only one usually continues to enlarge and mature while the others disintegrate. The maturing follicle develops an internal fluid-filled cavity and grows very large, forming a bulge near the surface of the ovary. The follicular phase ends with ovulation, when the follicle and adjacent wall of the ovary rupture, releasing the secondary oocyte. The follicular tissue that remains in the ovary after ovulation develops into the corpus luteum. Endocrine cells of the corpus luteum secrete female hormones during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. The next cycle begins with a new growth of follicles.

Hormones coordinate the menstrual and ovarian cycles in such a way that growth of the follicle and ovulation are synchronized with preparation of the uterine lining for possible implantation of an embryo. Five hormones participate in an elaborate scheme involving both positive and negative feedback. These hormones are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), secreted by the hypothalamus; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the two gonadotropins secreted by the anterior pituitary; and estrogens (a family of closely related hormones) and progesterone, the female sex hormones secreted by the ovaries. The relative levels of the pituitary and ovarian hormones in blood plasma are graphed in FIGURE 46.15a and b, and correlated with the phases of the ovarian and menstrual cycles. As you read the following discussion, refer to the figure as a guide to understanding how the hormones regulate the female reproductive system.

During the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, the pituitary secretes small amounts of FSH and LH in response to stimulation by GnRH from the hypothalamus. At this time, the cells of immature ovarian follicles have receptors for FSH but not for LH. The FSH stimulates follicle growth, and the cells of these growing follicles secrete estrogens. Notice in FIGURE 46.15b that there is a slow rise in the amount of estrogens secreted during most of the follicular phase. This small increase in estrogens inhibits secretion of the pituitary hormones, keeping the levels of FSH and LH relatively low during most of the follicular phase. These hormonal relationships change radically and rather abruptly when the rate of secretion of estrogens by the growing follicle begins to rise steeply. Whereas a slow rise of estrogens inhibits the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, a high concentration of estrogens has the opposite effect and stimulates the secretion of gonadotropins by acting on the hypothalamus to increase its output of GnRH. You can see this response in FIGURE 46.15a as a steep increase of FSH and LH levels that occurs soon after the increase in the concentration of estrogens. The effect is greater for LH because the high concentration of estrogens, in addition to stimulating GnRH secretion, also increases the sensitivity of LH-releasing mechanisms in the pituitary to the hypothalamic signal (GnRH). By now, the follicles have receptors for LH and can respond to this hormonal cue. In an example of positive feedback, the increase in LH concentration caused by increased secretion of estrogens from the growing follicle induces final maturation of the follicle, and ovulation occurs about a day after the LH surge.

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the transformation of the follicular tissue left behind in the ovary to form the corpus luteum, a glandular structure. (It is for this "luteinizing" function that LH is named.) Under continued stimulation by LH during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle, the corpus luteum secretes estrogens and a second steroid hormone, progesterone. The corpus luteum usually reaches its maximum development about 8 to 10 days after ovulation. As the levels of progesterone and estrogens rise, the combination of these hormones exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, inhibiting the secretion of LH and FSH. Near the end of the luteal phase, the corpus luteum disintegrates (possibly a result of prostaglandins secreted by its own cells). Consequently, concentrations of estrogens and progesterone decline sharply. The dropping levels of ovarian hormones liberate the hypothalamus and pituitary from the inhibitory effects of these hormones. The pituitary then begins to secrete enough FSH to stimulate the growth of new follicles in the ovary, initiating the follicular phase of the next ovarian cycle.

How is the ovarian cycle synchronized with the menstrual cycle? Estrogens, secreted in increasing amounts by growing follicles, are a hormonal signal to the uterus, causing the endometrium to thicken. Thus, the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. Before ovulation, the uterus is already being prepared for a possible embryo. After ovulation, estrogens and progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum stimulate continued development and maintenance of the endometrium, including an enlargement of arteries supplying blood to the uterine lining and the growth of endometrial glands that secrete a nutrient fluid that can sustain an early embryo before it actually implants in the uterine lining. Thus, the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. The rapid drop in the level of ovarian hormones when the corpus luteum disintegrates causes spasms of arteries in the uterine lining that deprive the endometrium of blood. Disintegration of the endometrium results in menstruation and the beginning of a new menstrual cycle. In the meantime, ovarian follicles that will stimulate renewed thickening of the endometrium are just beginning to grow. Cycle after cycle, the maturation and release of egg cells from the ovary is integrated with changes in the uterus, the organ that must accommodate an embryo if the egg cell is fertilized. In the absence of pregnancy, a new cycle begins. We will soon see that there are "override" mechanisms that prevent disintegration of the endometrium in the event of pregnancy.

In addition to their role in coordinating reproductive cycles, estrogens are also responsible for the secondary sex characteristics of the female. The hormones induce deposition of fat in the breasts and hips, increase water retention, affect calcium metabolism, stimulate breast development, and mediate female sexual behavior.

Menopause. On average, human females undergo menopause, the cessation of ovulation and menstruation, between the ages of 46 and 54. Apparently, during these years the ovaries lose their responsiveness to gonadotropins (the hormones FSH and LH) from the pituitary, and menopause results from a decline in production of estrogens by the ovary. Menopause is an unusual phenomenon; in most species, females as well as males retain their reproductive capacity throughout life. Is there an evolutionary explanation for menopause? Why might natural selection have favored females who stopped reproducing? One intriguing (and highly controversial) hypothesis proposes that during early human evolution, undergoing menopause after having some children actually increased a woman's fitness; losing the ability to reproduce allowed her to provide better care for her children and grandchildren, thereby increasing the survival of individuals bearing her genes.





 Embryonic and fetal development occur during pregnancy in humans and other eutherian (placental) mammals

From Conception to Birth

In placental mammals, pregnancy, or gestation, is the condition of carrying one or more embryos, new developing individuals, in the uterus. Pregnancy is preceded by conception, the fertilization of the egg by a sperm cell, and continues until the birth of the offspring. Human pregnancy averages 266 days (38 weeks) from conception, or 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual cycle. Duration of pregnancy in other species correlates with body size and the extent of development of the young at birth. Many rodents (mice and rats) have gestation periods of about 21 days, whereas those of dogs are closer to 60 days. In cows, gestation averages 270 days (almost the same as humans); in giraffes, it is about 420 days; and in elephants, gestation is more than 600 days.

Human gestation can be divided for convenience of study into three trimesters of about 3 months each. The first trimester is the time of most radical change for both the mother and the baby. Fertilization occurs in the oviduct (FIGURE 46.16). About 24 hours later, the resulting zygote begins dividing, a process called cleavage. Cleavage continues, with the embryo becoming a ball of cells by the time it reaches the uterus about 3 to 4 days after fertilization. By about 1 week after fertilization, cleavage has produced an embryonic stage called the blastocyst, a sphere of cells containing a flattened cavity. In a process that takes about 5 more days, the blastocyst implants into the endometrium. Differentiation of body structures now begins in earnest. (Embryonic development will be described in detail in Chapter 47.) During implantation, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium, which responds by growing over the blastocyst. The embryo obtains nutrients directly from the endometrium during the first 2 to 4 weeks of development. Meanwhile, tissues grow out from the developing embryo and mingle with the endometrium to form the placenta. This disk-shaped organ, containing embryonic and maternal blood vessels, grows to about the size of a dinner plate and weighs somewhat less than 1 kg. Diffusion of material between maternal and embryonic circulations provides nutrients, exchanges respiratory gases, and disposes of metabolic wastes for the embryo. Blood from the embryo travels to the placenta through arteries of the umbilical cord and returns via the umbilical vein, passing through the liver of the embryo (FIGURE 46.17).

The first trimester is also the main period of organogenesis, the development of the body organs (FIGURE 46.18). The heart begins beating by the fourth week and can be detected with a stethoscope by the end of the first trimester. By the end of the eighth week, all the major structures of the adult are present in rudimentary form. At this point, the embryo is called a fetus. Although well differentiated, the fetus is only 5 cm long by the end of the first trimester. Because of its rapid organogenesis, the embryo is most sensitive during the first trimester to such threats as radiation and drugs that can cause birth defects.

By the end of the second trimester (at 24 weeks), the fetus grows to about 30 cm in length.

The first trimester is also a time of rapid change for the mother. The embryo secretes hormones that signal its presence and control the mother's reproductive system. One embryonic hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), acts like pituitary LH to maintain secretion of progesterone and estrogens by the corpus luteum through the first trimester. In the absence of this hormonal override, the decline in maternal LH due to inhibition of the pituitary by progesterone would result in menstruation and spontaneous abortion of the embryo. Levels of HCG in the maternal blood are so high that some is excreted in the urine, where it can be detected in pregnancy tests. High levels of progesterone initiate changes in the pregnant woman's reproductive system, including increased mucus in the cervix that forms a protective plug, growth of the maternal part of the placenta, enlargement of the uterus, and (by negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary) cessation of ovulation and menstrual cycling. The breasts also enlarge rapidly and are often quite tender.

During the second trimester, the fetus grows rapidly to about 30 cm and is very active. The mother may feel movements during the early part of the second trimester, and fetal activity may be visible through the abdominal wall by the middle of this time period. Hormone levels stabilize as HCG declines, the corpus luteum deteriorates, and the placenta secretes its own progesterone, which maintains the pregnancy. During the second trimester, the uterus will grow enough for the pregnancy to become obvious.

The third and final trimester is one of rapid growth of the fetus to about 3-3.5 kg in weight and 50 cm in length. Fetal activity may decrease as the fetus fills the available space within the embryonic membranes. As the fetus grows and the uterus expands around it, the mother's abdominal organs become compressed and displaced, leading to frequent urination, digestive blockages, and strain in the back muscles. A complex interplay of hormones (estrogens and oxytocin) and local regulators (prostaglandins) induces and regulates labor (FIGURE 46.19). Estrogens, which reach their highest level in the mother's blood during the last weeks of pregnancy, trigger the formation of oxytocin receptors on the uterus. Oxytocin, produced by the fetus and the mother's posterior pituitary, stimulates powerful contractions by the smooth muscles of the uterus. Oxytocin also stimulates the placenta to secrete prostaglandins, which enhance the contractions. In turn, the physical and emotional stresses associated with the contractions stimulate the release of more oxytocin and prostaglandins, a positive feedback system that underlies the three stages of labor.

Birth, or parturition, occurs through a series of strong, rhythmic uterine contractions, commonly known as labor (FIGURE 46.20). The first stage is the opening up and thinning of the cervix, ending with complete dilation. The second stage is expulsion, or delivery, of the baby. Continuous strong contractions force the fetus down and out of the uterus and vagina. The umbilical cord is cut and clamped at this time. The final stage of labor is delivery of the placenta, which normally follows the baby.

Lactation is an aspect of postnatal care unique to mammals. After birth, decreasing levels of progesterone free the anterior pituitary from negative feedback and allow prolactin secretion. Prolactin stimulates milk production after a delay of 2 or 3 days. The release of milk from the mammary glands is controlled by oxytocin (see p. 962 and FIGURE 45.6).

Reproductive Immunology

Pregnancy is an immunological enigma. Half of the embryo's genes are inherited from the father, and thus many of the chemical markers present on the surface of the embryo will be foreign to the mother. Why, then, does the mother not reject the embryo as a foreign body as she would repel a tissue or organ graft bearing antigens from another person? Reproductive immunologists are working to solve this puzzle.

A major key to the puzzle is a tissue called the trophoblast (see FIGURE 47.15). Arising along with the embryo itself from the blastocyst, the trophoblast brings about implantation by growing into the endometrium and later develops into the fetal part of the placenta (see FIGURES 46.16 and FIGURES 46.17). To some extent, the trophoblast is a barrier separating the embryo from maternal tissue, but, like the embryo, it carries paternal antigens on the surfaces of its cells. So how can it protect the embryo from rejection?

Several lines of research suggest that the trophoblast prevents an immune response against the embryo by somehow interfering with the mother's T lymphocytes, important players in the immune system. For example, there is evidence that the trophoblast produces a chemical signal that induces the development of "suppressor" T cells in the uterus. It is proposed that the suppressor T cells prevent other T cells from attacking the foreign tissue, perhaps by blocking the action of interleukin-2, a cytokine required for a normal immune response (see FIGURES 43.11 and FIGURES 43.13).

An interesting part of the suppressor-cell hypothesis is the suggestion that the suppressor cells act, paradoxically, only after other white blood cells have identified the trophoblast as foreign tissue and have taken the first steps of the immune response. If this immunological alarm is not intense enough--that is, if the father's cell surface antigens are too similar to the mother-s--then no suppressor cells arise, and the embryo is attacked by the immune system. Similarity between maternal and paternal antigens may thus account for some cases of women who have multiple miscarriages. In support of this idea, some frequent miscarriers have been successfully treated before pregnancy with sensitizing injections of their mate's antigens.

A very different hypothesis is that the trophoblast secretes an enzyme that rapidly breaks down local supplies of tryptophan, an amino acid necessary for T cell survival and function. At least in mice, this enzyme seems to be essential for maintaining pregnancy. And more recent work on mice has led to yet another hypothesis, which involves a nonspecific part of the defense system. A protein found on mouse trophoblast cells protects the embryo's cells from attack by complement (see FIGURE 43.17). Scientists are now searching for comparable proteins made by the human trophoblast.

Contraception

Contraception, the deliberate prevention of pregnancy, can be achieved in a number of ways. Some contraceptive methods prevent the release of mature eggs (secondary oocytes) and sperm from gonads, others prevent fertilization by keeping sperm and egg apart, and still others prevent implantation of an embryo or abort the embryo (FIGURE 46.21, p. 994). The following brief introduction to the biology of these methods makes no pretense of being a contraception manual. For more complete information, you should consult a physician or health center personnel.

Fig 46-21. Mechanisms of some contraceptive methods. Red arrows indicate where these methods, devices, or products interfere with the flow of events from the production of sperm and egg (secondary oocyte) to the birth of a baby.

Fertilization can be prevented by abstinence from sexual intercourse or by any of several barriers that keep live sperm from contacting the egg. Temporary abstinence, often called the rhythm method of birth control or natural family planning, depends on refraining from intercourse when conception is most likely. Because the egg can survive in the oviduct for 24 to 48 hours and sperm for up to 72 hours, a couple practicing temporary abstinence should not engage in intercourse during the few days before and after ovulation. The most effective methods for timing ovulation combine several indicators, including changes in cervical mucus and body temperature during the menstrual cycle. Thus, natural family planning requires that the couple be knowledgeable about these physiological signs. A pregnancy rate of 10%  to 20%  is typically reported for couples practicing natural family planning. (Pregnancy rate is the number of women who become pregnant during a year out of every 100 women using a particular family-planning method, expressed as a percentage.) Some couples use the natural family planning method to increase the probability of conception.

The several barrier methods of contraception that block the sperm from meeting the egg have pregnancy rates of less than 10% . The condom, used by the male, is a thin, latex rubber or natural membrane sheath that fits over the penis to collect the semen. The barrier device most commonly used by females is the diaphragm, a dome-shaped rubber cap fitted into the upper portion of the vagina before intercourse. Both of these devices are more effective when used in conjunction with a spermicidal (sperm-killing) foam or jelly. More recently introduced barriers include the cervical cap, which fits tightly around the opening of the cervix and is held in place for a prolonged period by suction, and the vaginal pouch, or female condom.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs), which are small plastic or metal devices that fit into the uterine cavity, prevent implantation of the blastocyst in the uterus. IUDs have a low pregnancy rate but cause harmful effects in a small percentage of women. Problems of persistent vaginal bleeding, uterine infection, perforation of the uterus, tubal pregnancy (implantation of the embryo in the oviduct), and spontaneous expulsion of the devices have been reported and have led to lawsuits and the removal of IUDs from the market. Newer IUD products that prevent implantation by delivering synthetic progesterone locally to the endometrium are now available.

As a method of preventing fertilization, coitus interruptus, or withdrawal (removal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation), is unreliable. Sperm may be present in secretions that precede ejaculation, and a lapse in timing or willpower can result in late withdrawal.

Except for complete abstinence from sexual intercourse, the methods that prevent the release of gametes are the most effective means of birth control. Chemical contraceptives--birth control pills--have pregnancy rates of less than 1% , and sterilization is nearly 100%  effective. The most commonly used birth control pills are combinations of synthetic estrogens and a synthetic progestin (progesteronelike hormone). These two hormones act by negative feedback to stop the release of GnRH by the hypothalamus, and of FSH (an estrogen effect) and LH (a progestin effect) by the pituitary. By blocking LH release, the progestin prevents ovulation. As a backup mechanism, the estrogen inhibits FSH secretion so that no follicles develop. Combination birth control pills can be prescribed in high doses as morning after pills (MAP). Taken within 3 days of unprotected intercourse, they prevent fertilization or implantation, with an effectiveness of about 75% .

A second type of birth control pill, called the minipill, contains only progestin. The minipill prevents fertilization mainly by altering a woman's cervical mucus so that it blocks sperm from entering the uterus. In 1990, the FDA approved a progestin-only capsule (Norplant) that is implanted under the skin. Steadily releasing a tiny amount of progestin into the blood, the implant produces effective birth control for about 5 years. A product called Depo-Provera is a synthetic progestin that is injected every 3 months.

Birth control pills have been the center of much debate, particularly because of long-term harmful effects of the estrogens in combination pills. No solid evidence exists for cancers caused by the pill, but cardiovascular problems are a major concern. Birth control pills have been implicated in abnormal blood clotting, atherosclerosis, and heart attacks. Smoking while using chemical contraception increases the risk of mortality tenfold or more. Although the pill places women at risk for these diseases, it eliminates the dangers of pregnancy; women on birth control pills have mortality rates about one-half those of pregnant women.

Sterilization is the permanent prevention of gamete release. Tubal ligation in women usually involves cauterizing or tying off (ligating) a section of the oviducts to prevent eggs from traveling into the uterus. Vasectomy in men is the cutting of each vas deferens to prevent sperm from entering the urethra. Both male and female sterilization are relatively safe and free from harmful effects. Both are also difficult to reverse, so the procedures should be considered permanent.

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy in progress. Spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, is very common; it occurs in as many as one-third of all pregnancies, often before the woman is even aware she is pregnant. In addition, each year about 1.5 million women in the United States choose abortions performed by physicians. A drug called mifepristone, or RU486, developed in France, enables a woman to terminate pregnancy nonsurgically within the first 7 weeks. An analog of progesterone, RU486 blocks progesterone receptors in the uterus, thus preventing progesterone from maintaining pregnancy. It is taken with a small amount of prostaglandin to induce uterine contractions.

Of all contraceptives for sexually active individuals, latex condoms are the only ones that offer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. This protection is, however, not absolute.





 Modern technology offers solutions for some reproductive problems

Recent scientific and technological advances have made it possible to deal with problems of reproduction in striking ways. For example, it is now possible to diagnose many genetic diseases and congenital (present at birth) disorders while the fetus is in the uterus. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are invasive techniques in which amniotic fluid or fetal cells are obtained for genetic analysis (see FIGURE 14.17). Noninvasive procedures usually use high-frequency sound waves, or ultrasound imaging, to detect fetal condition (FIGURE 46.22). An alternate new technique relies on the fact that a few fetal blood cells leak across the placenta into the mother's bloodstream. A blood sample from the mother yields enough fetal cells that can be identified with specific antibodies (which bind to proteins on the surface of fetal cells) and then tested for genetic disorders.

Fig 46-22. Ultrasound imaging. This color-enhanced image shows a fetus in the uterus at about 18 weeks. The image is produced on a computer screen when high-frequency sounds from an ultra-sound scanner held against a pregnant woman's abdomen bounce off the fetus.

Diagnosing genetic diseases of fetuses poses important ethical questions. To date, essentially all detectable disorders remain untreatable in the uterus, and many cannot be corrected even after birth. Parents may be faced with difficult decisions about whether to terminate a pregnancy or cope with a child who may have profound defects and a short life expectancy. These are complex issues that demand careful, informed thought and competent counseling.

In the past 25 years, several techniques have been developed to assist childless couples who want to have offspring. For cases of male infertility, sperm from anonymous donors are widely available from sperm banks. Sperm are deposited in the vagina or cervix when it is possible for the woman to conceive. Another procedure, called in vitro fertilization, was developed for women whose oviducts are blocked. Ova are surgically removed following hormonal stimulation of the follicles. The ova are then fertilized in culture dishes in a laboratory. After about 2half; days, when the embryo has reached the eight-cell stage, it is placed in the uterus and allowed to implant. In vitro fertilization is costly but has a success rate similar to the pregnancy rate resulting from insemination by sexual intercourse. Embryos can be frozen for later use if the first attempt is unsuccessful. A couple may choose to have oocytes obtained from another woman fertilized with the male partner's sperm, although more serious ethical issues must be resolved when donors are used. Thousands of children have thus far been conceived by in vitro fertilization, and there is no evidence of any abnormalities associated with this procedure.

One area of reproductive research that has traditionally received little attention is male contraception. Male chemical contraceptives have proved elusive. Testosterone will block the release of pituitary gonadotropins, but testosterone itself stimulates spermatogenesis. Estrogens are effective, but they inhibit sex drive and can be feminizing. The best prospects so far are for antagonists of GnRH, which are potent inhibitors of spermatogenesis. Several experimental drugs and birth control techniques for both men and women are currently being tested.

In this chapter we have considered the structural and physiological bases of animal reproduction. The next chapter focuses on the mechanics of development that transform a zygote into an animal form and on other topics in animal development.

It is difficult to imagine that each of us began life as a single cell about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Less than a month after conception, our brains were taking form and our developing hearts had already begun to pulsate (see photograph). It took a total of only about nine months--the length of a school year--to be transfigured from zygote to newborn human, built of billions of differentiated cells organized into specialized tissues and organs.

By combining molecular genetics with classical approaches to embryology, developmental biologists are now beginning to answer many of the questions about how a single fertilized egg cell gives rise to a specific animal. Chapter 21 described some of the recent research, introducing you to a number of basic genetic and cellular mechanisms involved in development. The animals discussed there were mainly invertebrates. In this chapter we concentrate mainly on the embryonic development of animals with backbones.

Molecular biologist Sidney Brenner has wryly commented that developmental biology is about "how to make a mouse," and indeed, mice are favorite experimental models of researchers studying vertebrate development, in particular the development of mammals. Frogs and chickens are also important model organisms for understanding vertebrate development. From the study of these animals and of certain invertebrates (including the ones you met in Chapter 21), scientists have worked out both the stages of embryonic development and many of the cellular and molecular events that underlie them.

Now that we have described the main events of embryonic development in animals, the remainder of the chapter will address the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they occur. Although biologists are far from a full understanding of these mechanisms, several key principles have emerged as fundamental to the development of all animals.





 From egg to organism, an animal's form develops gradually: the concept of epigenesis

The question of how an egg becomes an animal has been asked for centuries. As recently as the 18th century, the prevailing view was that the egg or sperm contains an embryo that is a preformed, miniature infant (FIGURE 47.1). Development was thought to be simply the enlargement of the embryo. This idea of preformation came to include the notion that the embryo must contain all its descendants: a series of successively smaller embryos within embryos, like Russian nesting dolls. One theologian proposed that Eve, in the Garden of Eden, stored all future humanity within her.

Fig 47-1. A "homunculus" inside the head of a human sperm. According to one version of the preformation idea, a sperm contains a preformed, miniature infant, which simply grows in size during embryonic development. This engraving was made in 1694.

The competing theory of embryonic development was epigenesis, originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by Aristotle. According to this idea, the form of an animal emerges gradually from a relatively formless egg. As microscopy improved during the 19th century, biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps, and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favored explanation among embryologists.

Modern biology, of course, has completely discarded the idea of a tiny person living in an egg or sperm cell. But when interpreted in broader terms, the concept of preformation may have some merit. Although an embryo's form emerges gradually as it develops from a fertilized egg, something is preformed in the zygote. As discussed in Chapter 21, an organism's development is largely determined by the genome of the zygote and the organization of the cytoplasm of the egg cell. Messenger RNA, proteins, and other substances made by the mother are heterogeneously distributed in the unfertilized egg, and these substances have a profound effect on the development of the future embryo in most animal species (mammals may be an exception, as we will discuss later). After fertilization produces a zygote, cell division partitions the cytoplasm in such a way that nuclei of different embryonic cells are exposed to different cytoplasmic environments. This sets the stage for the expression of different genes in different cells. As cell division continues and the embryo develops, inherited traits emerge by mechanisms that selectively control gene expression, leading to the differentiation (specialization) of cells. The timely communication of instructions, telling cells precisely what to do when, is essential. This information transfer occurs by cell signaling among different embryonic cells. Along with cell division and differentiation, development involves morphogenesis, the process by which an animal takes shape. Thus, the overall process of development is one of epigenesis.

In the first half of the chapter we will survey the early stages of embryonic development, when the body plan of an animal emerges from the fertilized egg. In the second half of the chapter we will look at the cellular and molecular mechanisms that play major roles in the developmental process. We begin with the fertilization of an egg cell by a sperm.





 Fertilization activates the egg and brings together the nuclei of sperm and egg

The gametes, sperm and egg that unite during fertilization, are both highly specialized cell types produced by a complex series of developmental events in the testes and ovaries of the parents (see Chapter 46). The main function of fertilization is to combine haploid sets of chromosomes from two individuals into a single diploid cell, the zygote. Another key function is activation of the egg: Contact of the sperm with the egg's surface initiates metabolic reactions within the egg that trigger the onset of embryonic development.

Fertilization has been studied most extensively by combining the gametes of sea urchins in the laboratory. Although the details of fertilization vary with different animal groups, sea urchins (phylum Echinodermata) provide a good general model for the important events of fertilization. While sea urchins are not vertebrates or even chordates, they are deuterostomes (see Chapter 32), and their early development is similar to that of vertebrates.

The Acrosomal Reaction

The eggs of sea urchins are fertilized externally after the animals release their gametes into the surrounding seawater. When a sperm cell is exposed to molecules from the slowly dissolving jelly coat that surrounds an egg, a vesicle at the tip of the sperm called the acrosome discharges its contents by exocytosis (FIGURE 47.2, p. 1000). This acrosomal reaction releases hydrolytic enzymes that enable an elongating structure called the acrosomal process to penetrate the jelly coat of the egg. The tip of the acrosomal process is coated with a protein that adheres to specific receptor molecules located under the jelly coat, on the vitelline layer just external to the plasma membrane of the egg. In sea urchins and many other animals, "lock-and-key" recognition of molecules ensures that eggs will be fertilized only by sperm of the same species. This specificity is especially important when fertilization occurs externally in water, where gametes of other species are likely to be present.

Fig 47-2. The acrosomal and cortical reactions during sea urchin fertilization. The events following contact of a single sperm and egg ensure that only one sperm nucleus enters the cytoplasm of the egg.

The acrosomal reaction leads to the fusion of sperm and egg plasma membranes and the entry of a single sperm nucleus into the cytoplasm of the egg. Fusion of the membranes causes ion channels to open in the egg cell's plasma membrane, allowing sodium ions to flow into the egg cell and change the membrane potential, the voltage across the membrane (see Chapter 8, pp. 149-150). This membrane depolarization, as such a change is called, is common among animal species. Occurring within about 1 to 3 seconds after a sperm binds to the vitelline layer, the depolarization is also called the fast block to polyspermy because it prevents more than one sperm cell from fusing with the egg's plasma membrane. Without this block, multiple sperm could fertilize the egg--resulting in an aberrant number of chromosomes in the zygote.

The Cortical Reaction

Another major effect of the fusion of egg and sperm plasma membranes is the cortical reaction, a series of changes in the outer zone (cortex) of the egg cytoplasm (see FIGURE 47.2, step 6). The fusion of sperm and egg triggers a signal-transduction pathway that causes the egg's endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium (Ca2+) into the cytosol. The calcium release from the ER begins at the site of sperm entry and then propagates in a wave across the fertilized egg (FIGURE 47.3). Apparently the signaling pathway leads to production of the "second messengers" IP3 and DAG (see FIGURE 11.15). The IP3 opens ligand-gated calcium channels in the ER membrane; the Ca2+ released then triggers the opening of other channels, and so on. Within seconds, the high concentration of Ca2+ brings about a change in vesicles called cortical granules, which lie just under the egg's plasma membrane. Responding to the Ca2+ increase, the cortical granules fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the perivitelline space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer. Enzymes from the granules separate the vitelline layer from the plasma membrane while mucopolysaccharides produce an osmotic gradient, drawing water into the perivitelline space and swelling it. The swelling pushes the vitelline layer away from the plasma membrane, and other enzymes harden it. The result is that the vitelline layer becomes the fertilization envelope, which resists the entry of additional sperm. By this time, usually about a minute after sperm and egg fuse, the voltage across the plasma membrane has returned to normal, and the fast block to polyspermy no longer functions. But the fertilization envelope, along with other changes in the egg's surface, functions as a slow block to polyspermy.

Fig 47-3. A wave of Ca2+ release during the cortical reaction. A fluorescent dye that glows when it binds free Ca2+ was used in this experiment to track the cortical reaction from the point of sperm contact (0 sec) during the fertilization of a fish egg (LM). The spreading wave of calcium ions, released into the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum, triggers the release of more and more Ca2+. The high cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ causes the cortical granules to fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to formation of the fertilization membrane. The Ca2+ also helps activate metabolic changes inside the fertilized egg.

Activation of the Egg

The sharp rise in the egg's cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ not only triggers the cortical reaction but also incites metabolic changes within the egg cell. The unfertilized egg has a very slow metabolism, but within a few minutes of fertilization, the rates of cellular respiration and protein synthesis increase substantially. With these rapid changes, the egg cell is said to be activated. In sea urchins and many other species, the DAG produced during the cortical reaction activates a membrane protein that transports H+ out of the egg, making the egg cytosol slightly alkaline. This pH change seems to be indirectly responsible for the metabolic responses of the egg to fertilization.

Although the binding and fusion of sperm are triggers for egg activation, sperm cells do not contribute any materials required for activation. Indeed, the unfertilized eggs of many species can be artificially activated by the injection of Ca2+ or by a variety of mildly injurious treatments, such as temperature shock. This artificial activation switches on the metabolic responses of the egg and causes it to begin developing by parthenogenesis (without fertilization by a sperm). It is even possible to artificially activate an egg that has had its own nucleus removed, showing that the molecules involved in activation reside in the cytoplasm. (Of course, embryonic development of such an egg terminates at a very early stage, because the embryo lacks a genome.) The fact that an egg lacking a nucleus can begin making new kinds of proteins upon activation means that mRNA coding for these proteins must be stockpiled in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg.

While the activated egg gears up its metabolism, the nucleus of the sperm cell within the egg starts to swell. After about 20 minutes, the sperm nucleus merges with the egg nucleus, creating the diploid nucleus of the zygote. DNA synthesis begins, and the first cell division occurs in about 90 minutes (in the case of sea urchins and some frogs). The events of fertilization in sea urchins are summarized in FIGURE 47.4.

Fertilization in Mammals

In Chapter 46 you learned how in vitro fertilization of human eggs is enabling some couples with fertility problems to have children. The techniques for test-tube fertilization have also made it possible for developmental biologists to study the process of fertilization in mammals. Many of the events turn out to be similar to what has been observed in sea urchins, but there are also important differences.

In contrast to the external fertilization of sea urchins and most other marine invertebrates, fertilization in terrestrial animals, including mammals, is generally internal. Secretions in the mammalian female reproductive tract alter certain molecules on the surface of sperm cells that have been deposited during the male's ejaculation and also increase the motility of the sperm. This enhancement of sperm function in the female reproductive tract, called capacitation, requires about 6 hours in humans (FIGURE 47.5).

Fig 47-5. Fertilization in mammals. 
			  
		 The sperm migrates through the coat of follicle cells and binds to receptor molecules in the zona pellucida of the egg. (Receptor molecules are not shown here.) 
			  
		 This binding induces the acrosomal reaction, in which the sperm releases hydrolytic enzymes into the zona pellucida. 
			  
		 With the help of these enzymes, the sperm reaches the plasma membrane of the egg, and membrane proteins of the sperm bind to receptors on the egg membrane. 
			  
		 The plasma membranes fuse, making it possible for the contents of the sperm cell to enter the egg. 
			  
		 Enzymes released during the egg's cortical reaction harden the zona pellucida, which now functions as a block to polyspermy.

The mammalian egg (actually a secondary oocyte at this stage; see FIGURE 46.13) is cloaked by follicle cells that were released with the egg during ovulation. A capacitated sperm cell must migrate through this layer of follicle cells before it reaches the zona pellucida, the extracellular matrix of the egg. The zona pellucida consists of three different glycoproteins forming filaments that are cross-linked in a three-dimensional network. One of the glycoproteins, ZP3, also functions as a sperm receptor, binding to a complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head. The binding of the sperm head to receptor molecules induces the acrosome of the sperm cell to release its contents in an acrosomal reaction similar to that of sea urchin sperm. Protein-digesting enzymes and other hydrolases spilled from the acrosome enable the sperm cell to penetrate the zona pellucida and reach the plasma membrane of the egg. The acrosomal reaction also exposes a protein in the sperm membrane that binds and fuses with the egg membrane.

The binding of a sperm cell to the egg triggers depolarization of the egg membrane, which functions as a fast block to polyspermy, as in sea urchin fertilization. A cortical reaction, in which granules in the cortex of the egg release their contents to the outside of the cell via exocytosis, also occurs. Enzymes released from the cortical granules catalyze alterations of the zona pellucida, which then functions as the slow block to polyspermy.

Fingerlike extensions of the egg cell, called microvilli, take the whole sperm cell, tail and all, into the egg. The basal body of the sperm's flagellum divides and forms two centrosomes (with centrioles) in the zygote. These will generate the mitotic spindle for cell division; unfertilized mammalian eggs have no centrosomes of their own.

In contrast to sea urchin fertilization, the haploid nuclei of sperm and egg do not fuse immediately in mammals. Instead, the envelopes of both nuclei disperse, and the chromosomes from the two gametes share a common spindle apparatus during the first mitotic division of the zygote. Thus, it is not until after this first division, as diploid nuclei form in the two daughter cells, that the chromosomes from the two parents come together in common nuclei to form the genome of the offspring.





 Cleavage partitions the zygote into many smaller cells

Fertilization is followed by three successive stages that begin to build the animal's body. First, a special type of cell division, called cleavage, creates a multicellular embryo, the blastula, from the zygote. The second stage, gastrulation, produces a three-layered embryo called the gastrula. The third stage, called organogenesis, generates rudimentary organs from which adult structures grow.

Cleavage is a succession of rapid cell divisions that follow fertilization (FIGURE 47.6). During cleavage, the cells undergo the S (DNA synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases of the cell cycle but often virtually skip the G1 and G2 phases (see FIGURE 12.4). The embryo does not enlarge during this period of development. Cleavage simply partitions the cytoplasm of one large cell, the zygote, into many smaller cells called blastomeres, each with its own nucleus. Thus, different regions of cytoplasm present in the original undivided egg cell end up in separate blastomeres. And because the regions may contain different cytoplasmic components, the partitioning sets the stage for subsequent developmental events.

Cleavage is a series of cell divisions that transform the zygote into a ball of much smaller cells, called blastomeres (LMs).(a) The two-cell stage, following the first cleavage division, occurs about 45-90 minutes after fertilization. Notice that the fertilization envelope is still present. (b) The second cleavage division produces the four-cell stage. (c) In a few hours, further cleavage divisions have formed a multicellular ball. The embryo is still inside the fertilization envelope, from which the larva will eventually hatch.

With the apparent exception of mammals, most animals have both eggs and zygotes with a definite polarity. During cleavage in such organisms, the planes of division follow a specific pattern relative to the poles of the zygote. The polarity is defined by the heterogeneous distribution of substances in the cytoplasm, including specific mRNA and proteins, and yolk (stored nutrients). In many frogs and other animals, the distribution of yolk is a key factor in influencing the pattern of cleavage. Yolk is most concentrated at one pole of the egg, called the vegetal pole, while the opposite pole, the animal pole, has the lowest concentration of yolk. The animal pole is also the site where the polar bodies of oogenesis are budded from the cell (see FIGURE 46.13), and in some animals it marks the point where the anterior (head) end of the embryo will form.

The hemispheres of the zygote are named for their respective poles (FIGURE 47.7). In the eggs of many frogs, the animal and vegetal hemispheres have different coloration due to the heterogeneous distribution of cytoplasmic substances. The animal hemisphere has melanin granules embedded in the outer layer of the cytoplasm (the cortex), giving it a deep gray hue, while the vegetal hemisphere contains the yellow yolk. A rearrangement of the amphibian egg cytoplasm occurs at the time of fertilization. The plasma membrane and associated cortex rotate toward the point of sperm entry, probably because the centrosome brought into the egg by the sperm cell reorganizes the cytoskeleton. The rotation exposes a light-gray region of cytoplasm, a band called the gray crescent. Located near the equator of the egg on the side opposite the sperm entry, the gray crescent is an important early marker of the polarity of the amphibian egg: It corresponds to the dorsal side of the later embryo.

Fig 47-7. The establishment of the body axes and the first cleavage plane in an amphibian. The "animal" hemisphere of the egg, which will become the anterior end of the embryo, is dark gray due to melanin in its outer cytoplasm (cortex); the "vegetal" hemisphere is yellow because it contains the yolk. At fertilization, the pigmented cortex slides over the underlying cytoplasm toward the point of sperm entry, exposing a region of lighter-colored cytoplasm. The exposed region, known as the gray crescent, is opposite the point of sperm entry. The first cleavage division bisects the gray crescent. The crescent marks the location of the dorsal side of the future embryo. Thus, all three axes of the embryo are established before the zygote begins cleavage.

Because yolk tends to impede cell division, cleavage of the frog zygote occurs more rapidly in the animal hemisphere than in the vegetal hemisphere, resulting in an embryo with different-sized cells. In comparison with frog eggs, those of sea urchins and many other animals have less yolk but still have an animal-vegetal axis, owing to differential distribution of other substances. Without the restraint imposed by yolk, their cleavage divisions all occur at about the same rate, producing blastomeres of virtually equal size.

In both sea urchins and frogs, the first two cleavage divisions are meridional (vertical), resulting in four cells that each extend from animal to vegetal pole. The third division is equatorial (horizontal), producing an eight-celled embryo with two tiers of four cells each (FIGURE 47.8a). The general pattern up to this point is the same in both types of embryos. In fact, echinoderms, chordates, and the other animal phyla grouped as deuterostomes share many features of early embryonic development. These similarities help distinguish the deuterostomes from the protostomes, such as mollusks, annelids, and arthropods (see FIGURE 32.7).

Fig 47-8. Cleavage in a frog embryo. Yolk, concentrated near the vegetal pole of the egg, slows down the formation of cleavage furrows in the vegetal hemisphere. (a, b, and c are SEMs.)

Continued cleavage produces a solid ball of cells known as the morula, Latin for "mulberry," in reference to the lobed surface of the embryo at this stage (FIGURE 47.8b). A fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel forms within the morula, creating a hollow ball called the blastula (FIGURE 47.8c). In sea urchins, the blastocoel is centrally located in the blastula. However, in frogs, because of unequal cell division, the blastocoel is located in the animal hemisphere (FIGURE 47.8d).

Yolk is most plentiful and has its most pronounced effect on cleavage in the eggs of birds, reptiles, many fishes, and insects. In birds, for example, the part of the egg we commonly call the yolk is actually the egg cell (ovum), swollen with yolk nutrients. This enormous cell is surrounded by a protein-rich solution (the egg white) that will provide additional nutrients for the growing embryo. Cleavage of the fertilized egg is restricted to a small disc of yolk-free cytoplasm at the animal pole of the egg cell. This incomplete division of a yolk-rich egg is known as meroblastic cleavage. It contrasts with holoblastic cleavage, the complete division of eggs having little yolk (as in sea urchins) or a moderate amount of yolk (as in frogs).

The yolk-rich eggs of insects, such as Drosophila, undergo a unique type of meroblastic cleavage (see FIGURE 21.11). The zygote's nucleus is situated within a mass of yolk. Cleavage begins with the nucleus undergoing mitotic divisions that are not accompanied by cytokinesis. These mitotic divisions produce several hundred nuclei, which migrate to the outer edge of the egg. After several more rounds of mitosis, a plasma membrane forms around each nucleus, and the embryo, now a blastula, consists of a single layer of about 6,000 cells surrounding a mass of yolk.





 Gastrulation rearranges the blastula to form a three-layered embryo with a primitive gut

The morphogenetic process called gastrulation is a dramatic rearrangement of the cells of the blastula. Gastrulation differs in detail from one animal group to another, but a common set of cellular changes drives this spatial rearrangement of an embryo. These general cellular mechanisms are changes in cell motility, changes in cell shape, and changes in cellular adhesion to other cells and to molecules of the extracellular matrix (see FIGURE 7.29). The result of gastrulation is that some of the cells at or near the surface of the blastula move to an interior location, and three cell layers are established. The three-layered embryo is called the gastrula. The positioning of the cell layers in the gastrula allows cells to interact with each other in new ways.

The three layers produced by gastrulation are embryonic tissues called ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, also collectively termed the embryonic germ layers. The ectoderm forms the outer layer of the gastrula; the endoderm lines the embryonic digestive tract; and the mesoderm partly fills the space between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Eventually, these three cell layers develop into all the parts of the adult animal. For instance, our nervous system and the outer layer (epidermis) of our skin come from ectoderm; the innermost lining of our digestive tract and associated organs, such as the liver and pancreas, arise from endoderm; and most other organs and tissues, such as the kidney, heart, muscles, and the inner layer of our skin (dermis), develop largely from mesoderm.

Let's examine gastrulation in a sea urchin embryo (FIGURE 47.9). The wall of the sea urchin blastula consists of a single layer of cells. Gastrulation begins at the vegetal pole where individual cells detach from the blastula wall and enter the blastocoel as migratory cells called mesenchyme cells. The remaining cells flatten slightly to form a vegetal plate that buckles inward, a process called invagination. The buckled vegetal plate then undergoes extensive rearrangement of its cells, a process that transforms the shallow invagination into a deeper, narrower pouch called the archenteron, or primitive gut. The open end of the archenteron, which will become the anus, is called the blastopore. A second opening forms at the other end of the archenteron, forming the mouth end of what is now a rudimentary digestive tube. Gastrulation has produced an embryo with a primitive gut and three germ layers: ectoderm (color-coded blue throughout this chapter), endoderm (yellow), and mesoderm (red). Thus, the triploblastic (three-layered) body plan characteristic of most animal phyla is established very early in development (see FIGURE 32.6). In the sea urchin, the gastrula eventually develops into a ciliated larva that drifts near the ocean surface as plankton, feeding on bacteria and unicellular algae.

Fig 47-9. Sea urchin gastrulation. 
			  
		 Formed by cleavage, the blastula consists of a single layer of ciliated cells surrounding the blastocoel. Gastrulation begins with the migration of mesenchyme cells from the flattened "vegetal plate" into the blastocoel. 
			  
		 The vegetal plate in this early gastrula invaginates (buckles inward). Mesenchyme cells begin to form thin extensions (filopodia). 
			  
		 Endoderm cells form the archenteron (future digestive tube). Mesenchyme cells form filopodial connections between the tip of the archenteron and the ectoderm cells of the blastocoel wall (inset, LM). 
			  
		 Contraction of the filopodia in a late gastrula drags the archenteron the rest of the way across the blastocoel, where the endoderm of the archenteron will fuse with ectoderm of the blastocoel wall. 
			  
		 Gastrulation is complete. The gastrula has a functional digestive tube formed from the endoderm of the archenteron, with a mouth and an anus. Ectoderm forms the embryo's ciliated outer surface. Some of the mesenchyme cells of the mesoderm have secreted calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which will form a simple internal skeleton.

Gastrulation during frog development also produces a three-layered embryo with an archenteron, as shown in FIGURE 47.10. The mechanics of gastrulation are more complicated in a frog, however, because of the large, yolk-laden cells of the vegetal hemisphere, and because the wall of the blastula is more than one cell thick in most species. The first sign of gastrulation is a small crease on one side of the blastula caused by the invagination of a group of cells there. This invagination becomes the dorsal side of the blastopore, called the dorsal lip of the blastopore. The dorsal lip of the blastopore forms where the gray crescent was located in the zygote (see FIGURE 47.7). Successive invaginations of groups of cells near the dorsal lip result in the completion of the circular blastopore.

Fig 47-10. Gastrulation in a frog embryo.

Frog gastrulation continues with cells on the surface of the embryo rolling over the edge of the dorsal lip into the interior of the embryo, a process called involution. Once inside the embryo, these cells move away from the blastopore along the roof of the blastocoel. Involution continues, with migrating internal cells becoming organized into layered mesoderm and endoderm, and the archenteron forming within the endoderm. Eventually, the complex cell movements of gastrulation produce a three-layered embryo. As the process is completed, the circular lip of the blastopore encircles a yolk plug consisting of large, food-laden cells; these protruding cells will move inward as expansion of the ectoderm causes the blastopore to shrink. At this point, the cells remaining on the surface make up the ectoderm, surrounding the layers of mesoderm and endoderm. With the three germ layers in place, gastrulation is complete, and the embryo's organs begin to form.





 In organogenesis, the organs of the animal body form from the three embryonic germ layers

Various regions of the three germ layers develop into the rudiments of organs during the process of organogenesis (TABLE 47.1). Three kinds of morphogenetic changes--folds, splits, and dense clustering (condensation) of cells--are the first evidence of organ building. The organs that begin to take shape first in the embryos of frogs and other chordates are the neural tube and notochord, the skeletal rod characteristic of all chordate embryos (see FIGURE 34.6).

Table 47-1. Derivatives of the Three Embryonic Germ Layers in Vertebrates

Germ LayerOrgans and Tissues in the AdultEctodermEpidermis of skin and its derivatives (e.g., skin glands, nails); epithelial lining of mouth and rectum; sense receptors in epidermis; cornea and lens of eye; nervous system; adrenal medulla; tooth enamel; epithelium of pineal and pituitary glands.EndodermEpithelial lining of digestive tract (except mouth and rectum); epithelial lining of respiratory system; liver; pancreas; thyroid; parathyroids; thymus; lining of urethra, urinary bladder, and reproductive system.MesodermNotochord; skeletal system; muscular system; circulatory and lymphatic systems; excretory system; reproductive system (except germ cells, which start to differentiate during cleavage); dermis of skin; lining of body cavity; adrenal cortex.FIGURE 47.11 on page 1008 shows early organogenesis as it occurs in a frog. The notochord is formed from dorsal mesoderm that condenses just above the archenteron, and the neural tube originates as a plate of dorsal ectoderm just above the developing notochord. The neural plate soon folds inward, rolling itself into the neural tube, which will become the central nervous system--the brain and spinal cord. These organs are hollow in most chordates because of this mechanism of development. In frogs the notochord elongates and stretches the embryo along its anterior-posterior axis. Later, the notochord will function as a core around which mesodermal cells gather and form the vertebrae. Parts of the notochord between the vertebrae persist as the vertebral discs in adults. (These are the discs that can "slip," causing back pain.)

Fig 47-11. Organogenesis in a frog embryo.

Other condensations occur in strips of mesoderm lateral to the notochord, which separate into blocks called somites. The somites are arranged serially on both sides along the length of the notochord (FIGURE 47.11c). Cells from the somites not only give rise to the vertebrae of the backbone, they also form the muscles associated with the axial skeleton. This serial origin of the axial skeleton and muscles reinforces the point made in Chapter 34 that chordates are basically segmented animals, although the segmentation becomes less obvious later in development. (There are signs of segmentation even in the adult, as in the series of vertebrae in a human or the segments of chevron-shaped muscles in a fish.) Lateral to the somites, the mesoderm splits into two layers that form the lining of the body cavity, or coelom.

As organogenesis progresses, morphogenesis and cellular differentiation continue to refine the organs that arise from the three embryonic germ layers. Review TABLE 47.1, which lists the embryonic sources of the major organs and tissues in frogs and other vertebrates. Unique to vertebrate embryos, a band of cells called the neural crest develops along the border where the neural tube pinches off from the ectoderm. Cells of the neural crest subsequently migrate to various parts of the embryo, forming pigment cells of the skin, some of the bones and muscles of the skull, the teeth, the medulla of the adrenal glands, and peripheral components of the nervous system, such as sensory and sympathetic ganglia.

Embryonic development of the frog leads to a larval stage, the tadpole, which hatches from the jelly coat that originally cloaked the egg. Later, metamorphosis will transform the frog from the aquatic, herbivorous tadpole to the terrestrial, carnivorous adult.





 Amniote embryos develop in a fluid-filled sac within a shell or uterus

All vertebrate embryos require an aqueous environment for development. In the case of fish and amphibians, the egg is laid in the surrounding sea or pond and needs no special water-filled enclosure. The movement of vertebrate animals onto land required solving the problem of reproduction in dry environments, and two major solutions evolved: the shelled egg of reptiles and birds and the uterus of placental mammals. Within the shell or uterus, the embryos of birds, reptiles, and mammals are surrounded by fluid within a sac formed by a membrane called the amnion. Vertebrates of these three classes are therefore called amniotes (see Chapter 34). We have already examined the embryonic development of a vertebrate that lacks an amnion, the frog. For comparison, we now study the early development of two amniotes, a bird and a mammal.

Avian Development

After fertilization, a bird egg undergoes meroblastic cleavage in which cell division occurs only in a small region of yolk-free cytoplasm atop the large mass of yolk. The early cleavage divisions produce a cap of cells called the blastodisc, which rests on the undivided yolk. The blastomeres then sort into upper and lower layers, the epiblast and hypoblast (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). The cavity between these two layers is the avian version of the blastocoel, and this embryonic stage is the avian equivalent of the blastula, although its form is different from the hollow ball of an early frog embryo.

Fig 47-12. Cleavage, gastrulation, and early organogenesis in a chick embryo.

Gastrulation, as in the frog embryo, involves cells moving from the surface of the embryo to an interior location. In birds, however, the route of this cell migration is very different (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). Some cells of the upper cell layer (epiblast) move toward the midline of the blastodisc, then detach and move inward toward the yolk. The medial movement on the surface and the inward movement of cells at the blastodisc's midline produce a groove called the primitive streak. As the streak lengthens over the surface of the blastodisc, it marks what will become the bird's anterior-posterior axis. The primitive streak is functionally equivalent to the frog blastopore, but it is a linear tuck rather than a ring.

All the cells that will form the embryo come from the epiblast. Some of the epiblast cells that pass through the primitive streak move laterally into the blastocoel, producing the mesoderm. Other epiblast cells, which will produce the endoderm, migrate through the streak and downward, pushing out the cells of the hypoblast. The epiblast cells that remain on the surface give rise to the ectoderm. Although the hypoblast contributes no cells to the embryo, it seems to help direct the formation of the primitive streak before the onset of gastrulation and is required for normal development. The hypoblast cells later segregate from the endoderm and eventually form portions of a sac surrounding the yolk and a stalk connecting the yolk mass to the embryo. After the three germ layers are formed, the borders of the embryonic disc fold downward and come together, pinching the embryo into a three-layered tube joined at midbody to the yolk (FIGURE 47.12, step 
			  
		). Neural tube formation, development of the notochord and somites, and other events in organogenesis occur much as in the frog embryo. FIGURE 47.13 (p. 1010) shows some of the organs in a 2-day-old chick embryo.

Fig 47-13. Organogenesis in a chick embryo. Rudiments of most major organs have already formed in this chick, which is about 56 hours old (LM).

Notice in FIGURE 47.12, step 3, that only part of each germ layer contributes to the embryo itself (which is the protrusion that arises from the blastodisc). The tissue layers that are outside the embryo proper develop into four extraembryonic membranes that support further embryonic development within the egg. These four "membranes," each a sheet of cells, are the yolk sac, the amnion, the chorion, and the allantois. The diagram in FIGURE 47.14 shows these membranes for a developing chick, and the legend describes the functions of each membrane.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 47-14. The development of extraembryonic membranes in a chick. The four major membranes (labeled in bold type) provide support services for the embryo. Each is a sheet of cells that develops from epithelial sheets external to the embryo proper. The yolk sac expands over the surface of the yolk mass. Cells of the yolk sac will digest yolk, and blood vessels that develop within the membrane will carry nutrients into the embryo. Lateral folds of extraembryonic tissue extend over the top of the embryo and fuse to form two more membranes, the amnion and the chorion, which are separated by an extraembryonic extension of the coelom. The amnion encloses the embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic sac, protecting the embryo from drying out, and it, along with the chorion, cushions the embryo against mechanical shocks. The fourth membrane, the allantois, originates as an outpocketing of the embryo's hindgut. The allantois is a sac that extends into the extraembryonic coelom. It functions as a disposal sac for uric acid, the insoluble nitrogenous waste of the embryo. As the allantois expands, it presses the chorion against the vitelline membrane, the inner lining of the eggshell. Together, the allantois and chorion form a respiratory organ for the embryo. Blood vessels that form in the epithelium of the allantois transport oxygen to the embryo. The extraembryonic membranes of reptiles and birds are adaptations associated with the special problems of development on land.

Mammalian Development

In most mammalian species, fertilization takes place in the oviduct, and the earliest stages of development occur while the embryo completes its journey down the oviduct to the uterus (see Chapter 46). In contrast to the large, yolky eggs of birds and reptiles, the egg of a placental mammal is quite small, storing little in the way of food reserves. As already mentioned, the mammalian egg and zygote do not exhibit any obvious polarity with respect to the contents of the cytoplasm, and cleavage of the yolk-lacking zygote is holoblastic. However, mammalian gastrulation and early organogenesis follow a pattern similar to that of birds and reptiles. (Recall from Chapter 34 that mammals descended from reptilian stock during the early Mesozoic era.)

Cleavage is relatively slow in mammals. In the case of humans, the first division is complete about 36 hours after fertilization, the second division at about 60 hours, and the third division at about 72 hours. The blastomeres are equal in size. An important event during early mammalian development is the process of compaction, which occurs at the eight-cell stage. Before compaction, the cells of the early embryo are loosely packed; after compaction the cells tightly adhere to one another. Compaction involves the production of new proteins on the surface of the cells, including proteins called cadherins (discussed later in the chapter).

Further development of the human embryo is shown in FIGURE 47.15. 
			  
		 By about 7 days after fertilization, the embryo has over 100 cells arranged around a central cavity. This is the embryonic stage known as the blastocyst. Protruding into one end of the blastocyst cavity is a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass, which will subsequently develop into the embryo proper and some of the extraembryonic membranes. The outer epithelium surrounding the cavity is the trophoblast, which, along with mesodermal tissue, will form the fetal portion of the placenta. The embryo reaches the uterus by the blastocyst stage and soon begins to implant in the uterine lining (endometrium).


			  
		 The trophoblast initiates implantation by secreting enzymes that enable the blastocyst to penetrate the endometrium. Bathed in blood spilled from eroded capillaries in the endometrium, the trophoblast thickens and extends fingerlike projections into the surrounding maternal tissue. (The placenta will later form from this proliferated trophoblast and the region of endometrium it invades; see FIGURE 46.17.) Around the time of implantation, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst forms a flat disc with an upper layer of cells, the epiblast, and a lower layer, the hypoblast. These layers are homologous to those of birds, and, as in birds, the embryo will develop almost entirely from epiblast cells, while the hypoblast cells will form the yolk sac.


			  
		Now the extraembryonic membranes begin to develop. The trophoblast is giving rise to the chorion and continues to expand into the endometrium. The epiblast has begun to form the amnion, surrounding a fluid-filled cavity. Mesodermal cells that will become part of the placenta are also derived from the epiblast.


			  
		Gastrulation occurs by the inward movement of cells from the epiblast through a primitive streak to form mesoderm and endoderm, just as it does in the chick. We now have a three-layered embryo surrounded by proliferating extraembryonic mesoderm. Four extraembryonic membranes have formed, which are homologous to those of reptiles and birds. The chorion, which develops from the trophoblast, completely surrounds the embryo and the other extraembryonic membranes. The amnion begins as a dome above the proliferating epiblast and will eventually enclose the embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic cavity. (The fluid from this cavity is the "water" expelled from the vagina of the mother when the amnion breaks just prior to childbirth.) Below the developing embryo proper, the yolk sac encloses another fluid-filled cavity. Although this cavity contains no yolk, the membrane that surrounds it is given the same name as the homologous membrane in birds and reptiles. The yolk sac membrane of mammals is a site of early formation of blood cells, which later migrate into the embryo proper. The fourth extraembryonic membrane, the allantois, develops as an outpocketing of the embryo's rudimentary gut, as it does in the chick. The allantois is incorporated into the umbilical cord, where it forms blood vessels that transport oxygen and nutrients from the placenta to the embryo and rid the embryo of carbon dioxide and nitrogenous wastes. Thus, the extraembryonic membranes of shelled eggs, where embryos are nourished with yolk, were conserved as mammals diverged from reptiles in the course of evolution, but with modifications adapted to development within the reproductive tract of the mother.

Organogenesis begins with the formation of the neural tube, notochord, and somites. By the end of the first trimester of human development, rudiments of all the major organs have developed from the three germ layers, as was summarized in TABLE 47.1.





 Morphogenesis in animals involves specific changes in cell shape, position, and adhesion

Morphogenesis is a major aspect of development in both animals and plants, but only in animals does it involve the movement of cells. Movement of parts of a cell can bring about changes in cell shape or enable a cell to migrate from one place to another within the embryo. Changes in both cell shape and cell position are involved in cleavage, gastrulation, and organogenesis.

Changes in the shape of a cell usually involve reorganization of the cytoskeleton (see Chapter 7). Consider, for example, how the cells of the neural plate form the neural tube (FIGURE 47.16). First, microtubules oriented parallel to the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo apparently help lengthen the cells in that direction. At the dorsal end of each cell is a parallel array of actin filaments oriented crosswise. These contract, giving the cells a wedge shape that forces the ectoderm layer to bend inward. Similar cell-shape changes are observed for other invaginations (inpocketings) and evaginations (outpocketings) of tissue layers throughout development.

Fig 47-16. Change in cellular shape during morphogenesis. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton is associated with morphogenetic changes in embryonic tissues. As indicated here, in the formation of the neural tube of vertebrates, microtubules help elongate the cells of the neural plate. Microfilaments at the dorsal end of the cells may then contract, deforming the cells into wedge shapes and causing the ectoderm to bend inward.

The cytoskeleton also drives the active movement of cells from one place to another in developing animals. Cells "crawl" within the embryo by using cytoskeletal fibers to extend and retract cellular protrusions. This type of motility is akin to the amoeboid movement described in FIGURE 7.27b, but in contrast to the thick pseudopodia of amoeboid cells, the cellular protrusions of migrating embryonic cells are usually flat sheets (lamellipodia) or spikes (filopodia). In the gastrulation of some organisms, invagination is initiated by wedging of cells on the surface of the blastula, but the penetration of cells deeper into the embryo involves the extension of filopodia by cells at the leading edge of the migrating tissue. By dragging behind them the cells that follow them through the blastopore, the leading cells help move a sheet of cells from the embryo's surface into the blastocoel, where it forms the endoderm and mesoderm of the embryo (see FIGURE 47.9). There are also many situations in which cells migrate individually, as when the cells of the neural crest disperse to various parts of the embryo.

Cell crawling is also involved in a type of morphogenetic movement called convergent extension (FIGURE 47.17). In convergent extension, the cells of a tissue layer rearrange themselves in such a way that the sheet of cells becomes narrower (converges) while it becomes longer (extends). When many cells wedge between one another, the tissue can extend dramatically. Convergent extension is important in early embryonic development. It occurs, for example, as the archenteron elongates in sea urchin embryos and during involution in the frog gastrula.

Fig 47-17. Convergent extension of a sheet of cells. In this simplified diagram, changes in cell shape and position cause the layer of cells to become narrower and longer. An unknown signal causes the cells to elongate in a particular directon and to crawl between each other. The result of this convergence is the extension of the cell sheet in a direction perpendicular to the convergence.

Scientists do not yet understand exactly what triggers and directs convergent extension. However, the process probably involves the extracellular matrix (ECM), the mixture of secreted glycoproteins lying outside the plasma membranes of cells (see FIGURE 7.29). The ECM is known to help guide cells in many types of morphogenetic movements. ECM fibers may function as tracks, directing migrating cells along particular routes (FIGURE 47.18). Several kinds of extracellular glycoproteins, including various fibronectins, help cells move by providing anchorage for cell crawling. Other substances in the ECM keep cells on the correct paths by inhibiting migration in certain directions. Thus, depending on the substances they secrete, nonmigratory cells situated along migration pathways may promote or inhibit movement of other cells. As migrating cells move along specific paths through the embryo, receptor proteins on their surfaces pick up directional cues from the immediate environment. Signals from the receptors direct the cytoskeletal elements to propel the cell in the proper direction.

Fig 47-18. The extracellular matrix and cell migration. The micrographs here provide evidence that the orientation of the extracellular fibers of the ECM is controlled by the orientation of the cytoskeleton in the cells that secrete the extracellular materials. This is one way that a group of cells can influence the path along which another group of cells migrates during the development of tissues and organs. (a) Cells from the neural crest migrate along a strip of fibronectin fibers placed on an artificial underlayer (LM). (b) Two different fluorescent dyes demonstrate the close relationship between the orientation of fibronectin fibers of the ECM (left) and that of contractile microfilaments of the cytoskeleton (right) for two migrating cells (LMs). Notice that the orientations of the intracellular microfilaments and extracellular fibers correspond.

A good example of the role of the ECM in embryonic cell migration is the movement of mesoderm cells along fibronectin during amphibian gastrulation. Fibronectin fibers line the roof of the blastocoel, and as the mesoderm moves into the interior of the embryo, the cells at the free edge of the mesoderm sheet migrate along the fibers. Researchers can disrupt the ability of cells to attach to fibronectin by, for example, injecting embryos with antibodies against fibronectin. Such a disruption can block the inward movement of the mesoderm.

The glycoproteins that attach migrating cells to an underlying ECM also play a role in holding cells together when migrating cells reach their destinations and tissues and organs take shape. Also contributing to cell migration and stable tissue structure are glycoproteins called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which are located on the surfaces of cells and bind to CAMs on other cells. CAMs vary in either amount or chemical identity from one type of cell to another, and these differences help regulate morphogenetic movements and tissue building.

One important class of cell-to-cell adhesion molecules is the cadherins, which are so named because they require the presence of calcium ions for proper function. There are many different cadherins, and the gene for each cadherin is expressed in specific locations at specific times during embryonic development. Researchers have vividly demonstrated the importance of one particular cadherin in the formation of the frog blastula (FIGURE 47.19).

Fig 47-19. The role of a cadherin in frog blastula formation. (a) Researchers injected Xenopus oocytes with nucleic acid comple-mentary to the mRNA encoding a cadherin known as EP cadherin. The "antisense" nucleic acid causes the destruction of the normal mRNA so that no protein is produced (see discussion of RNA interference in Chapter 20). The absence of EP cadherin protein interfered with the development of the blastula. The blastocoel did not form properly, and the cells arranged themselves in a disorganized fashion. (b) In control embryos, the blastocoel formed normally.





 The developmental fate of cells depends on cytoplasmic determinants and cell-cell induction: a review

Coupled with the morphogenetic changes that give an animal and its parts their characteristic shapes, development also requires the timely differentiation of many kinds of cells in specific locations. As we discussed in Chapter 21, two general principles integrate our current knowledge of the genetic and cellular mechanisms that underlie differentiation during embryonic development:

In many animal species (mammals may be a major exception), the heterogeneous distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in the unfertilized egg leads to regional differences in the early embryo. By partitioning the heterogeneous cytoplasm of a polarized egg, cleavage parcels out different mRNAs, proteins, and other molecules to different blastomeres. These local differences in cytoplasmic composition help specify the body axes and influence the expression of genes that affect the developmental fate of cells. Thus, cytoplasmic determinants are responsible for the initial differences between cells in the early embryos of many kinds of animals.

Subsequently, in induction, interactions among the embryonic cells themselves induce changes in gene expression. These interactions eventually bring about the differentiation of the many specialized cell types making up a new animal. Induction may be mediated by diffusible chemical signals, or if the cells are actually in contact, by cell-surface interactions. (In Chapter 21 we saw how both types of cell signaling are involved in the development of the nematode vulva.)

It will help to keep these two principles in mind when we take a closer look at the molecular and cellular mechanisms of differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrate development. First, however, let's look at some historic experiments that provided early researchers with information about cell fates.





 Fate mapping can reveal cell genealogies in chordate embryos

You may recall that in the case of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it has been possible to map the developmental history of every cell, beginning with the first cleavage division of the zygote (see FIGURE 21.4). This sort of complete cell lineage has not been determined for other animals, but biologists have been making more general territorial diagrams of embryonic development, called fate maps, for over 70 years. Classic studies performed in the 1920s by German embryologist W. Vogt established that in embryos whose axes are defined early in development, it is often possible to ascertain which parts of the embryo will be derived from each region of the zygote or blastula. Following the lead of earlier work on marine worms and mollusks, Vogt charted fate maps for amphibian embryos (FIGURE 47.20a). Using nontoxic dyes, he labeled cells of different regions of the surface of amphibian blastulas with different colors and later sectioned the embryos to see where the colors turned up. Vogt's results were among the earliest indications that the lineage (the "genealogy") of cells making up the three germ layers created by gastrulation is traceable to cells in the blastula (compare FIGURES 47.20a and FIGURES 47.10). Later researchers developed more sophisticated techniques that allowed them to mark an individual blastomere during cleavage and then follow the marker as it was distributed to all the mitotic descendants of that cell (FIGURE 47.20b).

Fig 47-20. Fate maps for two chordates. (a) Fate map of a frog embryo. The fates of cells of a frog embryo were determined in part by marking different regions of the blastula surface with dyes of various colors and then determining the locations of dyed cells at later stages of development, such as at this neural tube stage. (b) Cell lineage analysis in a tunicate. Shown here are the results of a very specific type of fate map called a cell lineage analysis. The drawings depict 64-cell embryos of a tunicate, an invertebrate chordate. An individual cell can be injected with a dye, enabling a researcher to determine which cells in a later embryo are derived from the marked cells. The two light micrographs of larvae contrast the regions that develop from the two different blastomeres indicated in the drawings.

Developmental biologists have combined fate-mapping studies with experimental manipulation of parts of embryos in which they study whether a cell's fate can be changed by moving it elsewhere in the embryo. Two important conclusions have emerged. First, in most animals, certain early "founder cells" generate specific tissues of the older embryo. Second, as development proceeds, a cell's developmental potential--the range of structures that it can give rise to--becomes restricted. Starting with the normal embryo's fate map, researchers can examine how the differentiation of cells is altered in experimental situations or in mutant embryos.





 The eggs of most vertebrates have cytoplasmic determinants that help establish the body axes and differences among cells of the early embryo

In order to understand at the molecular level how embryonic cells acquire their fates, we must return to the question of how the basic axes of the embryo are established. It turns out that much of what you learned in Chapter 21 about the roles of cytoplasmic determinants in the development of fruit flies also applies to vertebrate animals.

Polarity and the Basic Body Plan

As you have learned, a bilaterally symmetrical animal has an anterior-posterior axis, a dorsal-ventral axis, and left and right sides. Establishing this basic body plan is a first step in morphogenesis and is prerequisite to the development of tissues and organs. In mammals, polarity is not obvious until after cleavage, although recent research suggests that the location at which the sperm enters the egg plays a role in determining the axes. However, in most species, basic instructions (where the head end will be, and so on) are set down earlier. For example, in many frogs, as we saw in FIGURE 47.7, the locations of melanin and yolk in the unfertilized egg respectively define the animal and vegetal hemispheres, which in turn determine the anterior-posterior body axis. Fertilization then triggers the formation of the gray crescent, whose position determines the dorsal-ventral axis.

Restriction of Cellular Potency

The asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic determinants in an egg does not necessarily lead to differences among the earliest blastomeres. The first cleavage may occur along an axis that produces two identical blastomeres, which will have equal developmental potential. This is what happens in amphibians, for instance. The first two blastomeres are similar, and if they are experimentally separated, each can develop into a normal tadpole. In other words, both blastomeres are totipotent. However, in experiments in which the entire gray crescent goes to one blastomere, only that blastomere has the capacity to develop into a normal tadpole when the blastomeres are separated (FIGURE 47.21). Thus, the fates of embryonic cells can be affected not only by the distribution of cytoplasmic determinants but also by the zygote's characteristic pattern of cleavage.

Fig 47-21. Experimental demonstration of the importance of cytoplasmic determinants in amphibians. The first cleavage division of an amphibian zygote normally divides the gray crescent evenly between the two blastomeres, which retain their totipotency after the division (left). However, when one blastomere receives the entire gray crescent (right), only that blastomere develops normally. The other blastomere, lacking cytoplasmic determinants present in the crescent, gives rise to an abnormal embryo without dorsal structures.

In many species, only the zygote is totipotent. The first cleavage plane divides cytoplasmic determinants in such a way that each blastomere will give rise only to specific parts of the embryo. In contrast, the cells of mammalian embryos remain totipotent until they become arranged into the trophoblast and inner cell mass of the blastocyst. The early blastomeres of mammals seem to receive equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic components from the egg. Indeed, up to the eight-cell stage, the blastomeres of a mammalian embryo all look alike, and each can form a complete embryo if isolated.

However similar or different the cells in an early embryo, the progressive restriction of potency is a general feature of development in all animals. In some species the cells of early gastrulas retain the capacity to give rise to more than one kind of cell, though they have lost their totipotency. If left alone, the dorsal ectoderm of an early amphibian gastrula will develop into a neural plate above the notochord. If the dorsal ectoderm is experimentally replaced with ectoderm from some other location, the transplanted tissue will form a neural plate. If the same experiment is performed on a late-stage gastrula, however, the transplanted ectoderm will not respond to its new location and will not form a neural plate. In general, the tissue-specific fates of cells in late gastrulae are fixed. Even when they are manipulated experimentally, cells of late gastrulae usually give rise to the same types of cell as in the normal embryo.





 Inductive signals drive differentiation and pattern formation in vertebrates

As embryonic cell division creates cells with different developmental potential, a new possibility arises. Now one group of cells can influence the development of a neighboring group of cells, in the process called induction. At the molecular level, the effect of induction--the response to an inductive signal--is usually the switching on of a set of genes that make the receiving cells differentiate into a specific tissue. You have already learned about the role of induction in vulval development in C. elegans (see FIGURE 21.17). Induction is an essential process in the development of many tissues in other animals as well.

The "Organizer" of Spemann and Mangold

The importance of induction in amphibian development was dramatically demonstrated in the 1920s by German zoologist Hans Spemann and his student Hilde Mangold. In a series of transplantation experiments, they discovered that the dorsal lip of the blastopore in the early gastrula plays a key role in embryonic development, initiating a chain of inductions that results in the formation of the neural tube and other organs. In their most famous experiment, they took a piece of dorsal lip from one embryo and grafted it on the ventral side of a second embryo (FIGURE 47.22). The result was the development of a second notochord and neural tube in the recipient embryo, at the location of the graft. Subsequently, other organs and structures formed, creating a nearly complete second embryo attached to the first. Spemann referred to the dorsal lip of the blastopore as the primary organizer of the embryo because of its early and crucial role in development. (We now know of other "organizers" that act even earlier than the dorsal lip of the blastopore.)

Fig 47-22. The "organizer" of Spemann and Mangold. The dorsal lip of the blastopore in the early gastrula of an amphibian plays a critical role in inducing the development of other parts of the embryo, as Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold demonstrated with this experiment in 1924.

Developmental biologists are working intensively to identify the molecular basis of induction by Spemann's organizer. An important clue has come from studies of a growth factor called bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4). (Bone morphogenetic proteins, a family of related proteins with a variety of developmental roles, derive their name from members of the family that are important in bone formation.) Amphibian BMP-4 is active exclusively in cells on the ventral side of the gastrula. One major function of organizer cells seems to be to inactivate BMP-4 on the dorsal side of the embryo by producing proteins that bind to BMP-4, rendering it unable to signal. Proteins related to BMP-4 and its inhibitors are also found in other animals, including invertebrates such as the fruit fly. The ubiquity of these molecules suggests that they evolved long ago and may participate in the development of many different organisms.

The induction that causes dorsal ectoderm to develop into the neural tube is only one of many cell-cell interactions that transform the three germ layers into organ systems. Many inductions seem to involve a sequence of inductive steps that progressively determine the fate of cells. For example, in the late gastrula of the frog, ectoderm cells destined to become the lenses of the eyes receive inductive signals from the ectodermal cells that will become the neural plate. Additional inductive signals probably come from endodermal cells and mesodermal cells. Finally, inductive signals from the optic cup, an outgrowth of the developing brain, complete the determination of the lens-forming cells.

Pattern Formation in the Vertebrate Limb

Inductive signals play a major role in pattern formation--the development of an animal's spatial organization, the arrangement of organs and tissues in their characteristic places in three-dimensional space. The molecular cues that control pattern formation, called positional information, tell a cell where it is with respect to the animal's body axes and help to determine how the cell and its descendants respond to future molecular signals.

In Chapter 21 we discussed pattern formation in the development of the body segments of Drosophila. For understanding pattern formation in vertebrates, an important model system has been limb development in the chick. The wings and legs of chicks, like all vertebrate limbs, begin as bumps of tissue called limb buds (FIGURE 47.23). Each component of a chick limb, such as a specific bone or muscle, develops with a precise location and orientation relative to three axes: the proximal-distal axis (the "shoulder-to-fingertip" axis), the anterior-posterior axis (the "thumb-to-little finger" axis), and the dorsal-ventral axis (the "knuckle-to-palm" axis). The embryonic cells within a limb bud respond to positional information indicating location along these three axes.

Fig 47-23. Organizer regions in vertebrate limb development.

A limb bud consists of a core of mesodermal tissue covered by a layer of ectoderm. By removing or transplanting different pieces of tissue, researchers have discovered two critical organizer regions in the limb bud, regions with profound effects on the limb's development. These two organizer regions are present in all vertebrate limb buds, including those that will develop into forelimbs (such as wings or arms) and those destined to become hindlimbs. In recent years researchers have established that the cells of these regions secrete proteins that provide key positional information to the other cells of the bud.

One limb-bud organizer region is the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a thickened area of ectoderm at the tip of the bud (see FIGURE 47.23a). The AER is required for the outgrowth of the limb along the proximal-distal axis and for patterning along this axis. The cells of the AER produce and secrete several proteins of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. These proteins appear to be the growth signal that promotes limb bud outgrowth. If the AER is surgically removed and beads soaked with FGF are put in its place, a nearly normal limb will develop. The AER and other ectoderm of the limb bud also appear to guide pattern formation along the limb's dorsal-ventral axis. In experiments where the ectoderm of a limb bud is detached from the mesoderm and then replaced with its orientation rotated 180&#176;, the limb elements that form have reversed dorsal-ventral orientation. (This is equivalent to reversing the palm and back of your hand.)

The second major limb-bud organizer region is the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), located where the posterior side of the bud is attached to the body. The ZPA is necessary for proper pattern formation along the anterior-posterior axis of the limb. Cells nearest the ZPA give rise to posterior structures, such as the digit homologous to our little finger, and cells farthest from the ZPA form anterior structures, such as the avian equivalent of our thumb. A tissue transplantation experiment demonstrating the importance of the ZPA is shown in FIGURE 47.24. Grafting a second ZPA on the anterior side of a limb bud leads to the formation of extra digits, in a mirror-image arrangement.

Fig 47-24. The experimental manipulation of positional information. The zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) issues molecular signals that establish the anterior-posterior axis of a vertebrate limb. In the experiment shown here, a second ZPA was added to the anterior margin of a chick limb bud by transplanting ZPA tissue from another limb bud. Cells near the grafted ZPA, like cells near the host bud's own ZPA, apparently receive positional information indicating "posterior." The pattern that emerges in the developing limb is a mirror image, with an arrangement of digits equivalent to two human hands joined together at the thumbs. In a subsequent experiment, researchers showed that a protein called Sonic hedgehog could substitute for the ZPA cells. Thus Sonic hedgehog functions as a positional cue.

In the ZPA-transplantation experiment, the extra digits develop from the host limb bud and not from the graft, supporting the hypothesis that the grafted ZPA produces some sort of inductive signal. Indeed, researchers have discovered that the cells of the ZPA secrete an important protein growth factor called Sonic hedgehog.* If cells genetically engineered to produce large amounts of Sonic hedgehog are implanted in the anterior region of a normal limb bud, a mirror-image limb results--just as if a ZPA had been grafted there. Evidence from studying the mouse version of Sonic hedgehog suggests that extra toes in mice--and perhaps also in humans--can result from the production of the protein in the wrong part of the limb bud. Proteins very similar to Sonic hedgehog have turned out to be important positional cues in a number of developmental situations, including segment formation in the Drosophila embryo. (The fruit-fly version, called simply Hedgehog, is the product of a segment-polarity gene; see FIGURE 21.13.)

Is Sonic hedgehog a morphogen? Recall from Chapter 21 that a morphogen is a substance that provides positional information in the form of a concentration gradient along an embryonic axis. Although gradients may be involved in the functioning of Sonic hedgehog, the Sonic hedgehog protein itself may not act in a graded manner; instead it may induce the production of something else that does. Researchers are currently investigating this issue.

In any case, we can conclude from experiments like the one in FIGURE 47.24 that pattern formation requires cells to receive and interpret environmental cues that vary from one location to another. These cues, acting together along three axes, tell cells where they are in the three-dimensional realm of a developing organ. In vertebrate limb development, we now know that specific proteins serve as some of these cues. In other words, organizer regions such as the AER and the ZPA function as signaling centers.

What determines whether a limb bud develops into a forelimb or a hindlimb? The cells receiving the signals from the AER and ZPA respond according to their developmental histories. Before the AER or ZPA issues its signals, earlier developmental signals have set up patterns of gene expression distinguishing the future forelimbs from the future hindlimbs. These differences cause the cells of the forelimb and hindlimb limb buds to react differently to the same positional cues.

A hierarchy of gene activations eventually affects the expression of homeobox-containing (Hox) genes in cells of the developing limb. Hox genes seem to be involved in specifying the identity of various regions of the limbs, as well as of the body as a whole (see Chapter 21). Thus, pattern formation is a chain of events involving many steps of signaling and differentiation. Various pathways of pattern formation occur in all the different parts of the developing embryo, eventually producing the final set of differentiated structures in the fully formed animal.

The scanning electron micrograph on this page shows an unusual juxtaposition of the basic components of animal nervous systems and computers--a single nerve cell (a neuron) on the surface of a microprocessor. Your own nervous system, made of living neurons, is using processes vastly more complex than those of a computer as you read and comprehend these words. Indeed, the human nervous system is probably the most intricately organized aggregate of matter on Earth. A single cubic centimeter of the human brain may contain well over 50 million nerve cells, each of which may communicate with thousands of other neurons in information-processing networks that make the most elaborate computer look primitive. These neural pathways control our every feeling, perception, and movement and enable us to learn, remember, think, and be conscious of ourselves and our surroundings.

The nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system often cooperate and interact in regulating internal body functions and behavior (see Chapters 43 and 45). In the maintenance of homeostasis, certain parts of the brain receive and process data about the body's internal environment and correct imbalances by sending out commands to other organs. Neural and endocrine pathways can also collaborate during responses to stress--enhancing or suppressing immune function, for example.

Despite their structural and functional linkage, the nervous system and endocrine system play somewhat different roles in body coordination. With its incomparable structural complexity, the nervous system can integrate vast amounts of information, such as that required for human thought and speech. Timing can also be a key difference. The endocrine system may take minutes, hours, or even days to act, partly because of the time it takes for hormones to be made and carried in the blood to their target organs. In contrast, the nervous system is a signaling network with branches carrying information directly to and from specific sites. Neurons are specialized for the fast transmission of impulses--as quickly as 150 m/sec (over 330 mph). In humans, information can travel from the brain to the hands (or vice versa) in a few milliseconds.

Animal survival and reproduction depends on rapid and flexible responses to changes in the environment, and a diversity of nervous systems has evolved in various animal phyla. This chapter discusses the form and function of these nervous systems. As we have seen in many other organ systems, animal nervous systems are remarkably similar at the cellular level--in how neurons work, for example--but differ at higher levels of organization, such as the structure and function of their brains.

Descriptions of the anatomy of neurons and nervous systems were made possible in the 18th and 19th centuries by increasingly sophisticated compound microscopes, but this did not explain how neurons communicate with each other. Toward the end of the 18th century Luigi Galvani discovered that frog muscle cells produce electricity, and in the 19th century Hermann von Helmholtz and others found that the electrical activity of nerve cells provides a means of carrying signals from one end of a cell to another and also between cells. Work over the past hundred years has shown that virtually all nerve signals are changes in the voltage across the plasma membranes of nerve cells. These voltage changes are caused by the movement of ions across the plasma membrane by way of specialized ion channels. Learning how these cellular processes work is central to an understanding of the nervous system. First we will examine the voltage gradient that exists across a cell's plasma membrane.

 Nervous systems perform the three overlapping functions of sensory input, integration, and motor output

In general, a nervous system has three overlapping functions: sensory input, integration, and motor output (FIGURE 48.1). Sensory receptors, such as the light-detecting cells in the eyes, collect information about the physical world outside the body as well as processes inside the organism; this sensory input is then conveyed to integration centers. Integration is the process by which the input is interpreted and associated with appropriate responses of the body. The circular arrow in FIGURE 48.1 indicates that integration is a continuous background activity. For the most part, integration is carried out in the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord in vertebrates. Motor output is the conduction of signals from the integration center, the CNS, to effector cells, the muscle cells or gland cells that actually carry out the body's responses to stimuli. The signals are conducted by nerves, ropelike bundles of extensions of neurons tightly wrapped in connective tissue. The nerves that communicate motor and sensory signals between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are collectively called the peripheral nervous system (PNS). From receptor to effector, information is communicated along a pathway of neurons by a combination of electrical and chemical signals. In this chapter we concentrate on communication within the nervous system. Chapter 49 connects the nervous system to its inputs and outputs by discussing sensory receptors and the physiology of movement.

Fig 48-1. Overview of a vertebrate nervous system. Integration of sensory input and motor output is not usually rigid and linear, but involves the continuous background activity symbolized by the brain's cyclical arrow in this diagram.





 Networks of neurons with intricate connections form nervous systems

Neuron Structure and Synapses

The structural and functional unit of the nervous system is the neuron, or nerve cell (FIGURE 48.2a). A neuron has a cell body, which contains the nucleus and other organelles, and it has fiberlike processes (extensions) of two general types. Dendrites (from the Greek dendron, tree) are short, highly branched processes that receive incoming messages from other cells and carry this information as an electrical signal toward the cell body. Axons, usually much longer than dendrites, convey outgoing messages from the neuron to other cells. Some axons, such as the ones connecting your spinal cord to your foot, can be over a meter long. The conical region of the axon where it joins the cell body is called the axon hillock; this region plays an essential role in the transmission and integration of nerve signals. Many axons are enclosed by an insulating layer called the myelin sheath. The supporting cells that form this sheath are described later in this section.

Axons have specialized endings called synaptic terminals, which relay signals from the neuron to other cells by releasing chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. The site of contact between a synaptic terminal and a target cell is called a synapse (FIGURE 48.2b). The target cell may be either another neuron or an effector, such as a muscle cell or gland cell. The transmitting cell is called the presynaptic cell, and the target cell is called the postsynaptic cell. An axon may be branched, and each branch may give rise to hundreds or thousands of synaptic terminals.

A Simple Nerve Circuit--the Reflex Arc

The simplest type of nerve circuit regulates a reflex, or automatic response, and is called a reflex arc. For example, this is the type of circuit that causes a clam to shut its shell when a shadow (which might be a potential predator) passes overhead.

The simplest reflex arcs require only two kinds of nerve cells. A sensory neuron receives information from a sensory receptor about a change in a stimulus such as light, pressure, or sound and passes this information on to a motor neuron. In turn, the motor neuron signals an effector cell, a muscle cell or gland cell that carries out the response. FIGURE 48.3 illustrates this sequence in the human knee-jerk reflex, the one that makes your leg jerk forward when the doctor hits your kneecap with a small hammer. The sudden, unexpected stretching of the tendon attached to the quadriceps (the front thigh muscle) is sensed by a specialized sensory neuron in the quadriceps. This sensory neuron signals a motor neuron to quickly counter the stretch by commanding the quadriceps to contract, causing your leg to jerk forward slightly.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 48-3. The knee-jerk reflex. For simplicity, only one neuron of each type is shown here, but actually many neurons are involved in the knee-jerk reflex.

Actually, our knee-jerk reflex involves more than this simple sensory/motor circuit. Contraction of the front thigh muscle is accompanied by inhibition of the back thigh muscles that flex the lower leg (pull it toward the body), and this inhibition involves a second nerve circuit. The sensory neurons from the quadriceps form synapses not only with motor neurons but also with interneurons in the spinal cord. In turn, these interneurons inhibit motor neurons to the flexor muscles, preventing them from contracting.

Most nerve circuits include large collections of interneurons that intervene between sensory receptors and effector cells to organize or integrate the most appropriate behaviors. Even in the simplest animals, most interneurons are constantly active, essentially "talking" to themselves. This continuous internal "conversation" within the CNS provides context for interpreting sensory input and directing an appropriate action in response. The large collections of interneurons that make up vertebrate brains, particularly human brains, bring an ongoing history to bear on what action is taken. If, for example, you decide that you don't want your knee to jerk forward when a doctor taps it with the hammer, interneurons passing from your brain to the spinal cord segment shown in FIGURE 48.3 can inhibit that reflex.

The cell bodies of motor neurons and interneurons are generally located in the gray matter of the central nervous system; the gray matter of the spinal cord is shown in FIGURE 48.3. The outer white matter in the spinal cord consists of motor and sensory axons. Notice, however, that the cell body of the sensory neuron in FIGURE 48.3 is located outside the spinal cord in a structure called the dorsal root ganglion. A ganglion (plural, ganglia) is a cluster of nerve cell bodies, often of similar function, located in the peripheral nervous system. Similar clusters within vertebrate brains are called nuclei (not to be confused with the nuclei of individual cells).

Adapted for different functions, sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons differ markedly in shape, and there is also a variety of shapes within each class. Examples of this structured diversity are shown in FIGURE 48.4. A nervous system involves the coordinated activity of tens of thousands to billions of these diverse nerve cells.

Fig 48-4. Structural diversity of neurons. These examples illustrate some of the variety in neuron shape. Cell bodies and dendrites are black; axons are magenta. (a) Vertebrate sensory neuron. The short, multibranched dendrites communicate with sensory receptor cells. A single, long axon, which is usually myelinated, conveys signals from the dendrites to synapses with neurons in the CNS. The cell body is connected only to the axon. This configuration is markedly different from that of the neuron in FIGURE 48.2a, which is a vertebrate motor neuron. (b) Two types of interneurons found in the mammalian brain. The top one has multiple dendrites and a branched axon; the bottom one has finely branched, meshlike dendrites. (c) An invertebrate motor neuron. In contrast to the vertebrate motor neuron in FIGURE 48.2a, the cell body connects only to the dendrites.

Types of Nerve Circuits

Nerve circuits show three basic patterns of organization. One kind of circuit takes information from a single source, such as an eye, to several parts of the brain; in this case the information from a single presynaptic neuron spreads out to several postsynaptic neurons. In a second kind of circuit, information from several presynaptic neurons converges at a single postsynaptic neuron. The convergent circuits can bring together information from several sources, such as vision, touch, and hearing, to identify an object in the environment. In a third type of circuit, information flows in a circular path, from one neuron to others and then back to its source. In the human brain, memories may be processed via circular paths and eventually stored.

Supporting Cells (Glia)

Supporting cells, or glia (from the Greek, glue) are essential for the structural integrity of the nervous system and for the normal functioning of neurons. Glia outnumber neurons tenfold to fiftyfold. Until recently, researchers assumed that glia play a supportive role without actually participating in nerve signaling. However, recent studies have suggested that some synaptic interactions do occur between glia and neurons.

There are several types of glia in the brain and spinal cord, and as a group these cells do much more than simply glue neurons together. In the developing embryo, supporting cells called radial glia form tracks along which neurons migrate or grow out from the neural tube, the structure that gives rise to the CNS (see FIGURE 47.11). In the mature CNS, glia called astrocytes provide structural and metabolic support for neurons. Astrocytes also induce the formation of tight junctions (see FIGURE 7.30) between cells lining the capillaries in the brain. The result is the blood-brain barrier, which restricts the passage of most substances into the brain, allowing the extracellular chemical environment of the CNS to be tightly controlled. Recent evidence also suggests that astrocytes communicate with one another and with neurons via chemical signals.

Oligodendrocytes (in the CNS) and Schwann cells (in the PNS) are glia that form insulating myelin sheaths around the axons of many neurons. The structure of a myelinated PNS axon is shown in FIGURE 48.5. Neurons become myelinated in a developing nervous system when Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes grow around axons such that their plasma membranes form concentric layers, somewhat like a jelly roll. The membranes are mostly lipid, which is a poor conductor of electrical currents. Thus, the myelin sheaths provide electrical insulation of the axon, analogous to the insulation that covers copper electrical wires. We will see later in this chapter that the myelin sheath also increases the speed of propagation of nerve impulses. In the degenerative disease known as multiple sclerosis, myelin sheaths gradually deteriorate, resulting in a progressive loss of coordination due to the disruption of nerve impulse transmission. Clearly, supporting cells are indispensable partners of neurons in a working nervous system.

 Every cell has a voltage, or membrane potential, across its plasma membrane

As we saw in Chapter 8, all living cells have an electrical charge difference (electrical potential, or voltage) across their plasma membranes. This membrane potential exists because of the different concentrations of ions on the inside and outside of a cell: Anions are more concentrated inside a cell and cations are more concentrated in the extracellular fluid. As a result, the plasma membrane is electrically polarized, meaning that it is more negatively charged on one side than on the other.

Measuring Membrane Potentials

Electrophysiologists can measure a cell's membrane potential as a voltage by using microelectrodes connected to a sensitive voltmeter or oscilloscope (FIGURE 48.6a). Precise mechanical devices called micromanipulators (seen next to the microscope in FIGURE 48.6b) are used to position one electrode just inside the cell for comparison with a reference electrode located outside the cell. The voltmeter indicates the magnitude of the charge separation across the membrane, typically about -50 to -100 mV (millivolts) in an animal cell. The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is negative in charge with respect to the outside. A neuron in its resting state (that is, not transmitting an electrical signal) usually has a membrane potential of about -70 mV (about 5%  of the voltage in a flashlight battery). This membrane potential of an unstimulated neuron is called the resting potential.

A number of invertebrates, including squid, lobsters, and earthworms, have some unusually large neurons that make excellent research models for studying nerve impulses. For example, the squid nervous system includes some neurons whose axons have diameters of about 1 mm. These giant axons are relatively easy to impale with microelectrodes. Once the electrodes are in place, they can be used to measure the voltage of the resting potential as well as to record changes in voltage due to ion currents that occur during the transmission of a nerve impulse. Much of the pioneering research on membrane potentials and on the nature of nerve signals was performed using squid giant axons.

How a Cell Maintains a Membrane Potential

The membrane potential exists because of differences in the ionic composition of the intracellular and extracellular fluids. The selective permeability of the plasma membrane maintains these ionic differences, which are shown in FIGURE 48.7a. Inside a cell the principal cation is potassium (K+), although there is also some sodium (Na+). Outside a cell the situation is reversed, with Na+ the principal cation and K+ having a much lower concentration. Inside a cell the principal anions are proteins, amino acids, sulfate, phosphate, and other negatively charged ions that we can group and symbolize by A-; chloride (Cl-) is also present but in a relatively low concentration. Outside a cell, Cl- is the main anion, with other anions present but less important in the context of membrane potentials.

Fig 48-7. The basis of the membrane potential. (a) Shown here are the approximate concentrations for a mammalian cell (in millimoles per liter, abbreviated mM) of potassium, [K+]; sodium [Na+]; chloride, [Cl-]; and anions that remain inside the cell, [A-]. K+ diffuses out of the cell down its concentration gradient, but the A- anions cannot follow, so the interior of the cell develops a net negative charge. (b) There is a steady diffusion of K+ out of the cell and steady diffusion of Na+ into the cell; the thickness of the arrows indicates the relative permeability of the membrane to K+ and Na+ (the permeability mainly reflects the number of ion-specific channels). Over time, diffusion would cause the ionic gradients shown in part (a) to dissipate. Dissipation is prevented by the sodium-potassium pump, which uses ATP to actively transport Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell.

Recall from Chapter 8 that the plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer with associated membrane proteins. Ions, being electrically charged, cannot dissolve in lipid and therefore cannot directly diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. In order to cross the membrane, ions must either be pumped by membrane proteins or move passively through ion channels, which are aqueous pores made up of specific transmembrane protein molecules. These channels are selective for specific ions; some allow only Na+ to cross, others allow only K+, and still others only Cl-. Depending on how many ion channels of each kind are present in the plasma membrane of a cell, it is possible for the membrane to have very different permeabilities to different ions. Most cells, including neurons, have much greater permeability to K+ than to Na+, suggesting that the membrane has many more potassium channels than sodium channels (FIGURE 48.7b). In a resting neuron, for instance, potassium permeability is about fiftyfold higher than sodium permeability. Because the internal anions (A-) are primarily large organic molecules such as proteins, they cannot cross the membrane and thus are a pool of internal negative charge that remains in the cell.

Although selective ion channels control the types of ions that diffuse passively into and out of a cell, they do not determine the direction or rate of passage. As you learned in Chapter 8, ions diffuse down an electrochemical gradient made up of two components: the concentrations of the specific ion in different regions (its chemical gradient); and the relative electrical charge in those regions (the electrical gradient). We would expect the ions that pass through ion channels to diffuse along the electrochemical gradient until reaching an equilibrium point when each type of ion enters the cell at the same rate it exits. Given this tendency toward equilibrium, how does a cell establish and maintain the distribution of ions shown in FIGURE 48.7a?

Consider the case of potassium ions. There is a large concentration gradient for diffusion of K+ out of the cell, and the membrane has a high permeability to potassium. Thus, there is a net outward flux (efflux) of K+, which transfers positive charge from the inside to the outside of the cell. Since negative charge, in the form of large anions (A-), is trapped within the cell, the inside of the cell becomes progressively more negative with respect to the outside, creating an electrical gradient across the membrane. In essence, this electrical gradient competes with the K+ concentration gradient: The increasing negative charge inside the cell attracts positively charged potassium, supporting an influx of K+.

If K+ were the only ion that could cross the membrane, the voltage across the membrane would continue to build up until the influx of K+ down the electrical gradient exactly balanced the efflux of K+ down its concentration gradient. At that point, there would be no further net transfer of charge across the membrane, and the membrane potential would reach a stable, resting value. For the potassium concentration gradient shown in FIGURE 48.7a, which is typical of a resting neuron, a stable membrane potential of about -85 mV would be required to exactly counterbalance the concentration gradient of K+. This value of the membrane potential is called the equilibrium potential for potassium ions, because it is the potential at which there will be no net movement of K+ across the membrane (in other words, potassium is at equilibrium).

Potassium, however, is not the only ion to which the plasma membrane is permeable. Although the membrane is much less permeable to Na+ than to K+, the permeability to Na+ is not zero (see FIGURE 48.7b). For sodium, both the concentration gradient (higher sodium concentration outside the cell) and the electrical gradient (more negative charge inside the cell) tend to move sodium ions into the cell. The resulting steady trickle of positive charge into the cell, carried by Na+, makes the actual value of the membrane potential somewhat more positive than would be expected if the membrane were permeable only to potassium ions. This explains why the membrane potential of a resting neuron is typically about -70 mV rather than about -85 mV.

Over time, a steady influx of sodium would cause a progressive increase in the sodium concentration inside a cell. Also, because the influx of Na+ makes the cell interior less negative than the -85 mV required to balance the potassium concentration gradient, there would be a steady efflux of potassium and a progressive decline in the internal K+ concentration. In other words, if the situation were left unchecked, the concentration gradients for Na+ and K+ shown in FIGURE 48.7a would gradually dissipate. This equilibrium is prevented by the sodium-potassium pump shown in FIGURE 48.7b. This protein, found in abundance in neurons, uses energy from ATP to drive the active transport of sodium back out of the cell, against both the concentration and electrical gradients for sodium. At the same time, the pump moves potassium into the cell, thus restoring the concentration gradient for this ion as well (see FIGURE 8.14 for details). In essence, the cell uses metabolic energy, in the form of ATP, to maintain the ionic gradients across the membrane that give rise to the steady-state membrane potential.





 Changes in the membrane potential of a neuron give rise to nerve impulses

All cells have a membrane potential; however, only certain kinds of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, have the ability to generate large changes in their membrane potentials. Collectively these cells are called excitable cells. The membrane potential of an excitable cell in a resting (unexcited) state is called the resting potential. As we will see, a change in this voltage may result in an electrical impulse. Changes in the membrane potential are made possible by the specialized ion channels of excitable cells. The ion channels we have discussed so far are called ungated, since they are open all of the time. Some cells, including neurons, also have gated ion channels, which open or close in response to stimuli. The resulting change in ion concentrations may cause a change in the membrane potential in response to the stimulus. In the case of a sensory neuron, the stimulus may come from the organism's environment--for example, light in the case of photoreceptors in the eye, or vibrations in the air in the case of receptors in the ear. In the case of an interneuron, the stimulus is ordinarily produced by the other neurons that provide chemical or electrical inputs to the cell.

Gated ion channels open or close in response to only one kind of stimulus. Chemically-gated ion channels open or close in response to a chemical stimulus, such as a neurotransmitter released from a synaptic terminal. Voltage-gated ion channels respond to a change in membrane potential. In addition, a gated ion channel (like other ion channels) allows only one kind of ion to pass through it. Thus, there are chemically-gated sodium channels and chemically-gated potassium channels, as well as voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. Each type of channel plays an essential role in the generation and transmission of electrical signals.

Graded Potentials: Hyperpolarization and Depolarization

A change in membrane potential is a localized electrical event at the point of stimulation. Let us consider what happens in a region of a dendrite that is stimulated by a neurotransmitter. The specific effect of this stimulus on membrane polarization depends on the type of chemically-gated ion channel that is opened. FIGURE 48.8a and b show two types of local responses. Some stimuli trigger a hyperpolarization, an increase in the voltage across the membrane (FIGURE 48.8a). One of the ways a stimulus can produce a hyperpolarization is by opening a potassium channel, which increases K+ outflow and causes the inside of the cell to become more negative. In contrast, a depolarization is a reduction in the voltage across the membrane (FIGURE 48.8b). One of the ways this can occur is by a stimulus opening a sodium channel; the increased inflow of Na+ makes the inside of the cell less negative. These voltage changes are called graded potentials because the magnitude of change (either hyperpolarization or depolarization) depends on the strength of the stimulus: A larger stimulus will open more channels, producing a larger change in permeability and thus a larger change in the membrane potential.

Fig 48-8. Graded potentials and the action potential in a neuron. Environmental changes can alter the cell's membrane potential. (a) One way a neuron can be hyperpolarized is by stimuli that open potassium channels. (b) A neuron can be depolarized by stimuli that open sodium channels. (c) A depolarizing stimulus of sufficient strength will change the membrane potential to a critical level called the threshold potential. This triggers an action potential, or nerve impulse. Unlike a graded potential, an action potential is an all-or-none event; the size of the action potential is not affected by the strength of the stimulus that triggered it.

The Action Potential: All or Nothing Depolarization

Depolarization of a neuron's plasma membrane is graded with stimulus intensity only up to a particular voltage, called the threshold potential. If a sufficiently strong stimulus causes depolarization to reach this threshold, it triggers a different type of response, called an action potential (FIGURE 48.8c). In a neuron, an action potential can be generated only in the axon. The action potential is typically triggered by a graded depolarization that originates in a dendrite or in the cell body and spreads along the membrane to the axon. The threshold potential is typically about 15 to 20 mV more positive than the resting potential--that is, about -50 to -55 mV for the plasma membrane of an axon. Hyperpolarizing stimuli do not produce action potentials; in fact, as we will see, hyperpolarization makes it more difficult for a stimulus to raise the membrane potential to threshold.

The action potential of an axon is the nerve impulse. It is a nongraded all-or-none event, meaning that the magnitude of the action potential is independent of the strength of the depolarizing stimulus that triggered it, provided the depolarization reaches threshold. Once an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential goes through a stereotypical sequence of changes, illustrated in FIGURE 48.9. The membrane polarity reverses abruptly, with the interior of the cell becoming positive with respect to the outside. This reversal (the spike in the graph) is followed by a rapid repolarizing phase, during which the membrane potential returns to its resting level. The whole event is typically over within a few milliseconds.

Fig 48-9. The role of voltage-gated ion channels in the action potential. The circled numbers on the action potential graph correspond to the five diagrams of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels in a neuron's plasma membrane.

Note that an action potential is an example of positive feedback (see Chapter 1). Depolarization of an axon's membrane to the threshold potential triggers an even larger depolarization, the action potential.

The action potential arises because the plasma membranes of axons have voltage-gated ion channels. The gates of these ion channels open and close in response to changes in membrane potential, controlling rapid influx and efflux of ions. Voltage-gated channels are activated when graded depolarization of an axon's membrane reaches the threshold level. Two types of voltage-gated channels, sodium channels and potassium channels, contribute to the action potential (see FIGURE 48.9). Each voltage-gated potassium channel has a single voltage-sensitive gate that is closed in the resting state and opens slowly in response to depolarization. By contrast, each voltage-gated sodium channel has two voltage-sensitive gates: 1) an activation gate that is closed in the resting state and opens rapidly in response to depolarization; and 2) an inactivation gate that is open in the resting state and closes slowly in response to depolarization.

What is the status of the voltage-gated channels in the instant after a threshold potential is reached? The K+ gates are opening slowly, and K+ is beginning to trickle out of the cell. At the same instant, Na+ is gushing into the cell because the activation gates of the Na+ channels are wide open, but the inactivation gates are just beginning to close slowly. It is this rapid influx of Na+ relative to the K+ efflux that accounts for the voltage change called the action potential.

Note in FIGURE 48.9 that the action potential spikes, with the rapid depolarization followed immediately by a repolarization that is just as rapid. Two factors underlie this repolarizing phase of the action potential as the membrane potential is returned to its resting state. First, the sodium channel inactivation gate, which is slow to respond to changes in voltage, has time to respond to depolarization by closing, returning sodium permeability to its low resting level. Second, potassium channels, whose voltage-sensitive gates also respond relatively slowly to depolarization, have had time to open. As a result, K+ flows rapidly out of the cell during repolarization, helping restore the internal negativity of the resting neuron. The potassium channel gates are also the main cause of an undershoot, or hyperpolarization, that follows the repolarizing phase (see FIGURE 48.9). Instead of returning immediately to their resting position, these relatively slow-moving gates remain open during the undershoot, allowing potassium to keep flowing out of the neuron. The continued potassium outflow makes the membrane potential more negative than the resting potential--that is, it hyperpolarizes the membrane.

Notice that during the undershoot, both the activation gate and the inactivation gate of the sodium channel are closed. If a second depolarizing stimulus arrives during this period, it will be unable to trigger an action potential because the inactivation gates have not had time to reopen after the preceding action potential. This period when the neuron is insensitive to depolarization is called the refractory period, and it sets the limit on the maximum frequency with which action potentials can be generated.

If the action potential is an all-or-none event with amplitude (size) unaffected by the intensity of the stimulus, how can the nervous system distinguish strong stimuli from weaker ones that are still sufficient to trigger action potentials? Strong stimuli result in a greater frequency of action potentials than weaker stimuli; if a stimulus is intense, the neuron will fire repeatedly, producing action potentials as rapidly as the refractory period will allow. Thus, it is the number of action potentials per second, not their amplitude, that codes for stimulus intensity in the nervous system.





 Nerve impulses propagate themselves along an axon

For an action potential to function as a long-distance signal, it must somehow "travel" along the axon to the far end of the cell. The action potential does not actually travel but is regenerated repeatedly along the axon. The regeneration mechanism is the same as for graded depolarization: Na+ entering the cell creates an electrical current that depolarizes the next neighboring region of the membrane. In the case of an action potential, however, the Na+ influx is extensive enough to assure that the neighboring region will be depolarized above threshold, triggering a new action potential at that position (FIGURE 48.10, p. 1032). Thus, the effect of an action potential is like tipping the first of a row of standing dominoes. Just as the first domino's fall is relayed to the end of the row, the first action potential generates an action potential in the next part of the membrane, and so on to the end of the axon.

Fig 48-10. Propagation of the action potential. The three parts of this figure show the changes that occur in a portion of an axon at three successive times as a nerve signal passes from left to right. At each point along the axon, the voltage-gated channels go through the sequence described in FIGURE 48.9, reproducing the sequence of voltage changes associated with the action potential. (The "status" of the membrane is color-coded to FIGURE 48.9.)

What prevents Na+ entry from reexciting the region behind the action potential, which would cause the impulse to spread back along the axon toward the cell body as well as in the normal direction of propagation? Recall that an action potential is followed by a refractory period, when inactivation gates of sodium channels are closed and an action potential cannot be triggered. A wave of depolarization passing a point along the axon cannot induce another action potential behind it, but only in the forward direction. Thus, the axon is normally a one-way avenue for the conduction of nerve impulses.

Several factors affect the speed at which action potentials propagate along an axon. One factor is the diameter of the axon: The larger the axon's diameter, the faster the speed of transmission. This is because resistance to the flow of electrical current is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the "wire" that conducts the current. In a thick axon, the depolarization associated with an action potential at a particular location can effectively reach farther along the interior of the axon and set up a new action potential at a greater distance away than in a thin axon. Transmission speed varies from several centimeters per second in very thin axons to about 100 m/sec in the giant axons of certain invertebrates, including squid and lobsters. These giant axons function in behavioral responses requiring great speed, such as the backward tail-flip that enables a threatened lobster or crayfish to escape.

A different means of speeding the propagation of action potentials has evolved in vertebrates. Recall that many axons in vertebrate nervous systems are myelinated, coated with insulating layers of membranes deposited by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells (see FIGURE 48.5). The voltage-gated ion channels that produce the action potential are concentrated in the nodes of Ranvier, small gaps between successive Schwann cells along the axon. Also, extracellular fluid is in contact with the axon membrane only at the nodes, so that the flow of ions between the inside and outside of the axon can occur only in these regions. For these reasons, the action potential does not propagate itself in the regions between the nodes. Rather, the Na+ current generated by the action potential at a node travels all the way to the next node, where it stimulates depolarization and a new action potential (FIGURE 48.11). This mechanism is called saltatory conduction (from the Latin saltare, to leap) because the action potential appears to "jump" along the axon from node to node. Saltatory conduction can transmit impulses at speeds up to 150 m/sec in myelinated neurons.

Fig 48-11. Saltatory conduction. In a myelinated axon, the ion current during an action potential at one node of Ranvier spreads along the interior of the axon to the next node (blue arrows), triggering an action potential there. The action potential thus jumps from node to node as it propagates along the axon (red arrows).

We have seen how stimulating the dendrite of a neuron can produce an action potential in the axon that is propagated to the very tip of the cell. Our next step is to find out how the impulse is transmitted from a neuron to another neuron or an effector (muscle or gland cell).





 Chemical or electrical communication between cells occurs at synapses

Synapses are unique cell junctions that control communication between a neuron and another cell. Synapses are found between two neurons, between sensory receptors and sensory neurons, between motor neurons and the muscle cells they control, and between neurons and gland cells. Here we focus on synapses between neurons, which usually conduct signals from an axon's synaptic terminals to dendrites or cell bodies of the next cells in a neural pathway. Synapses are of two types: electrical synapses and chemical synapses.

Electrical Synapses

An electrical synapse allows action potentials to spread directly from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. The cells are connected by gap junctions (see FIGURE 7.30), intercellular channels that allow the local ion currents of an action potential to flow between neurons. The giant axons of lobsters and other crustaceans are connected end to end and coupled by electrical synapses. These make it possible for impulses to travel from neuron to neuron without delay and with no loss of signal strength. Electrical synapses in the central nervous systems of vertebrates synchronize the activity of neurons responsible for some rapid, stereotypical movements. For example, electrical synapses in the brain enable some fishes to flap their tail very rapidly when escaping from predators. However, chemical synapses are much more common than electrical synapses in vertebrates and most invertebrates.

Chemical Synapses

At a chemical synapse, a narrow gap, or synaptic cleft, separates the presynaptic cell from the postsynaptic cell. Because of the cleft, the cells are not electrically coupled, and an action potential occurring in the presynaptic cell cannot be transmitted directly to the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. Instead, a series of events converts the electrical signal of the action potential arriving at the synaptic terminal into a chemical signal that travels across the synapse, where it is converted back into an electrical signal in the postsynaptic cell.

The key to understanding the function of a chemical synapse is to examine its structure. The cytoplasm at the tip of the presynaptic axon contains numerous sacs called synaptic vesicles (FIGURE 48.12). Each vesicle contains thousands of molecules of a neurotransmitter, the substance that is released as an intercellular messenger into the synaptic cleft. Although many different neurotransmitters have been discovered in the nervous systems of animals, most neurons secrete only one kind of neurotransmitter. However, a single postsynaptic neuron may receive chemical signals from a variety of neurons that secrete different neurotransmitters from their synaptic terminals.

Fig 48-12. A chemical synapse. When an action potential depolarizes the membrane of the synaptic terminal, it 1 triggers an influx of Ca2+ that 2 causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic neuron. 3 The vesicles release neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. These molecules diffuse across the cleft and bind to the receptors of ion channels embedded in the postsynaptic membrane. 4 The binding of neurotransmitter molecules to their specific receptors opens specific ion channels--Na+ channels, in the synapse illustrated here, causing a Na+ influx that depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane. 5 The neurotransmitter molecules are quickly degraded by enzymes or are taken up by another neuron, closing the ion channels and terminating the synaptic response.

A presynaptic neuron dispatches neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse when an action potential arrives at the synaptic terminal and depolarizes the presynaptic membrane, the surface of the synaptic terminal that faces the cleft. Calcium ions play a central role in this conversion of the electrical impulse into a chemical signal. Depolarization of the presynaptic membrane causes Ca2+ to rush into the neuron through voltage-gated channels. The sudden rise in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ stimulates the synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and spill the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis (see Chapter 8). Thousands of vesicles may respond in unison to a single action potential. The neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance from the presynaptic membrane to the postsynaptic membrane, the plasma membrane of the cell body or dendrite on the other side of the synapse.

The postsynaptic membrane is specialized to receive the chemical message. Projecting from the extracellular surface of the membrane are proteins that function as specific receptors for neurotransmitters. The receptors are part of selective ion channels that open and close, controlling movements of ions across the postsynaptic membrane. A receptor is keyed to a particular type of neurotransmitter, and when it binds to this chemical, the gate of the ion channel opens, allowing specific ions, such as Na+, K+, or Cl-, to cross the membrane. Thus, the ion channels of the postsynaptic membrane are chemically gated, in contrast to the voltage-gated channels responsible for the action potential.

The ion movements resulting from the binding of neurotransmitter to its receptors alter the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. Depending on the type of receptors and the ion channels they control, neurotransmitters binding to the postsynaptic membrane may either depolarize or hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane. As we will soon see, depolarization and hyperpolarization have opposite effects on the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. In either case, the neurotransmitter is quickly removed, either by chemical breakdown or uptake into adjacent cells. This removal ensures that the effect of a neurotransmitter on a postsynaptic cell will be brief and precise, so that the next action potential arriving at the synapse will be transmitted. For example, the neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine is rapidly degraded by cholinesterase, an enzyme present in both the synaptic cleft and the postsynaptic membrane.

Note that one important function of the synapse is to allow nerve impulses to be transmitted only in a single direction over a neural pathway. Synaptic vesicles are present only in synaptic terminals, and thus only the presynaptic membrane can discharge neurotransmitters. And receptors are restricted to the postsynaptic membrane, ensuring that only this membrane can receive a chemical signal from another neuron.





 Neural integration occurs at the cellular level

A single neuron may receive information from numerous neighboring neurons via thousands of synapses, some of them excitatory and some of them inhibitory (FIGURE 48.13). If you reexamine the physiology of the knee-jerk reflex in FIGURE 48.3, you-ll see examples of both types of synapses. The synapses between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons that stimulate the quadriceps muscles to contract are excitatory; the synapses between the interneurons and the motor neurons innervating the flexor muscles are inhibitory.

Fig 48-13. Integration of multiple synaptic inputs. (a) Each neuron, especially in the central nervous system, is on the receiving end of thousands of synapses, some excitatory (green) and others inhibitory (red). At any instant an action potential may be generated at the axon hillock if the combined effect of ion currents induced by excitatory and inhibitory synapses depolarizes the membrane to the threshold potential. Synapses close to the axon hillock generally have a stronger effect on the membrane potential than other synapses. b. This micrograph reveals numerous synaptic terminals of presynaptic neurons that communicate with a single postsynaptic cell (SEM).

At an excitatory synapse, the binding of neurotransmitter molecules to postsynaptic receptors opens a type of gated channel that allows Na+ to enter and K+ to leave the cell. Because the driving force is greater for Na+ than for K+ (remember, both voltage and concentration gradients drive Na+ into the cell--see FIGURE 48.7), the effect of opening these channels is a net flow of positive charge into the cell. This depolarizes the plasma membrane, moving the membrane potential closer to the threshold voltage and making it more likely that the axon of the postsynaptic cell will generate an action potential. In this case, the electrical change that is caused by the binding of neurotransmitter to the receptor is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential, or EPSP.

At an inhibitory synapse, the binding of neurotransmitter molecules to the postsynaptic receptors opens gated ion channels that make the plasma membrane more permeable to K+, to Cl-, or to both of these ions. Diffusing down their concentration gradients, K+ rushes out of the cell and Cl- flows in. These ion fluxes hyperpolarize the membrane--that is, they push the membrane potential to a voltage even more negative than the resting potential--making it more difficult for an action potential to be generated. Therefore, the voltage change associated with chemical signaling at an inhibitory synapse is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential, or IPSP. Whether a particular neurotransmitter results in an EPSP or an IPSP depends on the type of receptors and gated ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane responding to that neurotransmitter.

Both EPSPs and IPSPs are graded potentials that vary in magnitude with the number of neurotransmitter molecules binding to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The local change in membrane voltage, either depolarization or hyperpolarization, lasts only a few milliseconds because the neurotransmitters are inactivated by enzymes soon after their release into the synapse. Recall, however, that a graded potential creates ion currents that result in a wave of voltage change that spreads along a membrane from the point of stimulation (neurotransmitter binding, in this case). Thus, EPSPs and IPSPs propagate themselves along the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, but the successive voltage changes decrease in magnitude with the distance from the synapse. The axon hillock (see FIGURE 48.2) is the region where voltage-gated sodium channels open and generate an action potential when some stimulus has depolarized the membrane to the threshold. For the postsynaptic cell to "fire" (generate an action potential), the local ion currents due to EPSPs must be strong enough to reach and depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock to the threshold potential, usually about -50 mV.

A single EPSP at one synapse, even one close to the axon hillock, is not usually strong enough to trigger an action potential (FIGURE 48.14, p. 1036). However, several synaptic terminals acting simultaneously on the same postsynaptic cell, or a smaller number of synaptic terminals discharging neurotransmitters repeatedly in rapid-fire succession, can have a cumulative impact on the membrane potential at the axon hillock, raising it to threshold. This additive effect of postsynaptic potentials is called summation. Notice in FIGURE 48.14a that repeated subthreshold EPSPs that do not overlap in time do not depolarize the membrane to threshold.

Fig 48-14. Summation of postsynaptic potentials. These graphs trace changes in membrane potentials at a postsynaptic neuron's axon hillock. The arrows indicate times when signals trigger changes in membrane potentials at two excitatory synapses (E1 and 2, green) and at one inhibitory synapse (I1, red). Like most single EPSPs, those shown at E1 and E2 cannot depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock all the way to the threshold level, and thus without summation do not trigger an action potential.

There are two types of summation: temporal summation and spatial summation. In temporal summation, chemical transmissions from one or more synaptic terminals occur so close together in time that each postsynaptic potential affects the membrane before the voltage has returned to the resting potential after the previous stimulation (FIGURE 48.14b). In spatial summation, several different synaptic terminals, usually belonging to different presynaptic neurons, stimulate a postsynaptic cell at the same time and have an additive effect on the membrane potential (FIGURE 48.14c). By reinforcing one another through temporal or spatial summation, the ion currents associated with several EPSPs can depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock to threshold, causing the neuron to fire. Summation also applies to IPSPs: two or more IPSPs can hyperpolarize the membrane to a more negative voltage than any single release of a neurotransmitter at an inhibitory synapse can achieve. Furthermore, IPSPs and EPSPs counter each other's electrical effects (FIGURE 48.14d).

The axon hillock is the neuron's integrating center, the region where the membrane potential represents the summed effect of all EPSPs and IPSPs. At any instant, the membrane potential at the axon hillock is an average of the depolarization due to summation of all EPSPs and the hyperpolarization due to summation of all IPSPs. Whenever EPSPs overpower IPSPs enough for the membrane potential at the axon hillock to reach threshold, an action potential is generated, and the impulse is transmitted along the axon to the next synapse. A few milliseconds later, after the refractory period, the neuron may fire again if the sum of all synaptic inputs at that moment is still sufficient to depolarize the membrane at the axon hillock to threshold level. On the other hand, by that time the sum of all EPSPs and IPSPs may put the membrane potential at the axon hillock at a voltage more negative than the threshold, or may even hyperpolarize the membrane to a potential more negative than the resting potential, thereby desensitizing the neuron for the moment.

Action potentials, remember, are all-or-none events. But now we see that the occurrence of these nerve impulses depends on the ability of the neuron to integrate quantitative information in the form of multiple excitatory and inhibitory inputs, each involving the specific binding of a neurotransmitter to a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane.





 The same neurotransmitter can produce different effects on different types of cells

Dozens of different substances, many of them small, nitrogen containing organic molecules, are known to function as neurotransmitters, and researchers expect to find many more. Table 48.1 summarizes the major known neurotransmitters. Notice that a particular neurotransmitter can trigger different responses in postsynaptic cells. This versatility depends on the receptors present on different postsynaptic cells and on the receptor's mode of action. Many neurotransmitters bind with receptors that have a direct effect on ion channel proteins, altering the membrane permeability of the postsynaptic cell (see FIGURE 48.12). This type of synaptic communication can take only a few milliseconds, serving the rapid and precise transfer of information at a single synapse. Other neurotransmitters take much longer (up to several minutes) because they communicate via complex signal-transduction pathways in the postsynaptic cell. In some cases neurotransmitters in the brain--such as those regulating mood, attention, and arousal--remain active long enough after their release to diffuse to many synapses and modulate their activity.

Acetylcholine is one of the most common neurotransmitters in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In the vertebrate central nervous system, acetylcholine can be inhibitory or excitatory, depending on the type of receptor. At the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, the synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell, acetylcholine is released from the synaptic terminal of the motor neuron. It binds with a receptor that has a direct stimulatory effect on the muscle cell plasma membrane. The effect is excitatory, depolarizing the membrane of the postsynaptic muscle cell. A second type of acetylcholine receptor in heart muscle activates a signal-transduction pathway whose G proteins have two effects: They inhibit adenyl cyclase and open K+ channels in the muscle cell membrane, making it less able to generate an action potential. Both effects reduce the strength and rate of cardiac muscle cell contraction.

Biogenic Amines

The biogenic amines are neurotransmitters derived from amino acids. One group, known as catecholamines, consists of neurotransmitters produced from the amino acid tyrosine. This group includes epinephrine and norepinephrine, which also function as hormones (see Chapter 45), and a closely related compound called dopamine. Another biogenic amine, serotonin, is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. The biogenic amines often affect biochemical processes within the postsynaptic cell. In many cases they bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, triggering signal-transduction pathways that affect the activities of specific enzymes in the postsynaptic cell.

The biogenic amines most commonly function as transmitters within the CNS. However, norepinephrine also functions in a branch of the peripheral nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, which we will examine shortly. Dopamine and serotonin are widespread in the brain and affect sleep, mood, attention, and learning. Imbalances of these neurotransmitters are associated with several disorders. For example, the degenerative illness Parkinson's disease is associated with a lack of dopamine in the brain, and an excess of dopamine is linked to schizophrenia. Some psychoactive drugs, including LSD and mescaline, apparently produce their hallucinatory effects by binding to serotonin and dopamine receptors in the brain.

Other Chemical Neurotransmitters

Four amino acids are known to function as CNS neurotransmitters: gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, glutamate, and aspartate. GABA, believed to be the transmitter at most inhibitory synapses in the brain, produces IPSPs by increasing the chloride permeability of the postsynaptic membrane.

Several neuropeptides, relatively short chains of amino acids, serve as neurotransmitters. In common with the biogenic amines, neuropeptides often operate via signal-transduction pathways. A neuropeptide called substance P is a key excitatory signal that mediates our perception of pain. The endorphins are neuropeptides that function as natural analgesics, decreasing the perception of pain by the CNS. Neurochemists first discovered endorphins in the 1970s while studying the mechanism of opium addiction. Candace Pert and Solomon Snyder of Johns Hopkins University found specific receptors for the opiates morphine and heroin on neurons in the brain. It seemed odd that humans would have receptors keyed to chemicals from a plant (the opium poppy). Further research showed that, in fact, the drugs bind to these receptors in the brain by mimicking endorphins, the natural painkillers produced in the brain during times of physical or emotional stress, such as the labor of childbirth (see FIGURE 2.19). In addition to relieving pain, endorphins also decrease urine output (by affecting ADH secretion; see Chapter 45), depress respiration, produce euphoria, and have other emotional effects through specific pathways in the brain. An endorphin is also released from the anterior pituitary gland as a hormone that affects specific regions of the brain. Once again, we see the overlap between endocrine and nervous system control.

Gaseous Signals of the Nervous System

In common with many other types of cells, some neurons of the vertebrate PNS and CNS utilize gas molecules, notably nitric oxide (NO, see Chapter 45) and carbon monoxide (CO), as local regulators. For example, during sexual arousal of human males, certain neurons release NO gas into the erectile tissue of the penis. In response, smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel walls of the erectile tissue dilate and the spongy erectile tissue fills with blood, producing an erection. The male impotence drug, Viagra&#174;, increases the ability to achieve and maintain an erection during sexual arousal by inhibiting an enzyme that slows the muscle-relaxing effects of NO.

Many cells release gas molecules in response to chemical signals. For instance, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine released by neurons into the walls of blood vessels stimulates the endothelial cells of the vessels to synthesize and release NO. In turn, NO signals the neighboring smooth muscle cells to relax, dilating the vessels. The discovery of this mechanism in the late 1980s explained the medicinal action of nitroglycerin, which had been used for a century to treat angina (chest pain associated with reduced blood supply to the heart). Enzymes convert nitroglycerin to NO, which dilates the blood vessels that supply cardiac muscle.

Unlike typical neurotransmitters, NO and other gaseous messengers are not stored in cytoplasmic vesicles; cells synthesize them on demand. They diffuse into neighboring target cells, produce a change, and are broken down--all within a few seconds. In many of its targets, including smooth muscle cells, NO works like many hormones, stimulating a membrane-bound enzyme to synthesize a second messenger that directly affects cellular metabolism.

Now that we have discussed some key concepts about neurons, nerve signals, and neurotransmitters, we can consider how this cellular level of life contributes to the workings of the overall nervous system.





 The ability of cells to respond to the environment has evolved over billions of years

The fact that you are reading the words on this page illustrates what an extraordinary product of biological evolution our human brains are. At the cellular level, however, the physiology of excitability originated billions of years ago with prokaryotes that could sense changes in their environment and respond in ways that enhanced survival and reproductive success--for example, by chemotaxis steering certain bacteria to food sources (see Chapter 27). Modification of this simple single-celled behavior of sensing and reacting to environmental chemicals provided multicellular organisms with a mechanism for communication between cells of the body. By the time of the Cambrian explosion nearly 600 million years ago (see Chapter 34), systems of nerve cells that allowed animals to sense and move rapidly had evolved in essentially their modern forms.





 Nervous systems show diverse patterns of organization

While there is remarkable uniformity in how nerve cells function throughout the animal kingdom, there is great diversity in how nervous systems are organized. What distinguishes the various levels of complexity among animal nervous systems is not so much their basic building blocks, the neurons themselves, but how these cells are networked. These networks are responsible for the feats of sensing and acting we will examine in Chapter 49 and for the animal behaviors we will describe in Chapter 51.

Some simple multicellular animals lack a nervous system altogether; sponges, for instance, have no cells specialized for impulse conduction (see FIGURE 33.3). The simplest animals with nervous systems, the cnidarians, have bodies organized around radially symmetrical cavities that ingest and expel food (see FIGURE 33.4). In some of these animals, such as the hydra shown in FIGURE 48.15a, the neurons controlling the contractions and expansions of these cavities are arranged in diffuse nerve nets. Nerve nets also play a role as components of the nervous system of more complex animals. For example, the sea star shown in FIGURE 48.15b has a nerve ring connected to radial nerves that link to a nerve net in each arm, allowing for more complex movement patterns than the hydra. And a netlike system of neurons in the walls of our intestines controls the smooth muscles that function in peristalsis (see Chapter 41).

Fig 48-15. Diversity in nervous systems.

Greater complexity of nervous systems and more complex behavior evolved with cephalization, which included the clustering of sensory neurons and other nerve cells to form a small brain near the anterior (head) end and mouth region in animals with elongated, bilaterally symmetrical bodies. In relatively simple cephalized animals such as the planarian shown in FIGURE 48.15c, small brains and longitudinal nerve cords, which control the animals- directional movements, constitute the first clearly defined central nervous system (CNS). In more complex invertebrates such as insects and mollusks, behavior is regulated by more complicated brains and ventral nerve cords containing segmentally arranged ganglia (FIGURE 48.15e, f, and g). The longitudinal nerve cord of vertebrates, such as the salamander shown in FIGURE 48.15h, runs along the dorsal rather than the ventral surface of the body and does not contain segmental ganglia (though there are segmental ganglia lateral to the nerve cord--see FIGURE 48.2).

Mollusks are good examples of how nervous system organization correlates with how various animals live and interact with their environments. Sessile or slow-moving mollusks such as clams or chitons have little or no cephalization and relatively simple sense organs (FIGURE 48.15f). In contrast, cephalopod mollusks (squid and octopuses) have the most sophisticated nervous systems of any invertebrates, rivaling even those of some vertebrates. The large brain of a squid or octopus, accompanied by large, image-forming eyes and rapid signaling along giant axons, correlates well with the active predatory life of these animals (FIGURE 48.15g). Researchers have demonstrated in laboratory experiments that octopuses can learn to discriminate among visual patterns and perform complex tasks.

Now that we have surveyed nervous systems of varying complexity, let's take a closer look at the structure and function of nervous systems in our own subphylum.





 Vertebrate nervous systems have central and peripheral components

All vertebrate nervous systems have some fundamental similarities, including distinct central and peripheral elements and a high degree of cephalization. In all vertebrates the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS), and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything outside the CNS (FIGURE 48.16). The brain provides the integrative power that underlies the complex behavior of all vertebrates. The spinal cord, which runs lengthwise inside the vertebral column (spine), integrates simple responses to certain kinds of stimuli (such as the knee-jerk reflex) and conveys information to and from the brain. The vertebrate PNS transmits information to and from the CNS and regulates the internal environment of the organism.

Fig 48-16. The nervous system of a vertebrate. The components of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) develop from the dorsal, hollow nerve cord, a hallmark of chordates. Cranial nerves (originating in the brain), spinal nerves (originating in the spinal cord), and ganglia outside the central nervous system make up the peripheral nervous system.

Neurons of the central nervous system surround a continuous system of fluid-filled cavities. The vertebrate CNS is derived from the dorsal hollow nerve cord of the embryo--one of the phylogenetic hallmarks of chordates (see Chapter 34). This development from a tube explains why both the brain and spinal cord contain fluid-filled spaces. The narrow central canal of the spinal cord is continuous with the fluid-filled spaces, called ventricles, of the brain. These cavities are filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which is formed in the brain by filtration of the blood. Circulating through the central canal and ventricles (and then draining back into the veins), the cerebrospinal fluid conveys nutrients, hormones, and white blood cells across the blood-brain barrier described earlier to different parts of the brain. Among the most important functions of cerebrospinal fluid is to act as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain. Also protecting the brain and spinal cord are layers of connective tissue, called meninges. In mammals, cerebrospinal fluid circulates between two of the meninges, providing an additional cushion for the brain.

Axons within the CNS are located in well-defined bundles, or tracts, whose myelin sheaths give them a whitish appearance. In cross sections of the brain and spinal cord, this white matter is clearly distinguishable from gray matter, which consists mainly of dendrites, unmyelinated axons, and clusters of nerve-cell bodies, or nuclei.





 The divisions of the peripheral nervous system interact in maintaining homeostasis

Structurally, the vertebrate PNS consists of paired cranial and spinal nerves and associated ganglia (see FIGURE 48.16). The cranial nerves originate in the brain and innervate organs of the head and upper body. The spinal nerves originate in the spinal cord and innervate the entire body. Mammals have 12 pairs of cranial nerves and 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Most of the cranial nerves and all of the spinal nerves contain both sensory and motor neurons; a few of the cranial nerves are sensory only (the olfactory and optic nerves, for example).

Because most nerves contain a diversity of neurons that play different roles, it is convenient to divide the PNS into a hierarchy of components that differ in function (FIGURE 48.17). The sensory division of the PNS is made up of the sensory, or afferent (incoming), neurons that convey information to the CNS from sensory receptors that monitor the external and internal environment. The motor division is composed of the motor, or efferent (outgoing), neurons that convey signals from the CNS to effector cells. The motor division is divided, in turn, into two functional divisions, called the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.

The somatic nervous system carries signals to skeletal muscles, mainly in response to external stimuli. The somatic nervous system is often considered voluntary because it is subject to conscious control, but a substantial proportion of skeletal muscle movement is actually determined by reflexes mediated by the spinal cord or lower brain.

The autonomic nervous system conveys signals that regulate the internal environment by controlling smooth and cardiac muscles and the organs of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, excretory, and endocrine systems. This control is generally involuntary.

The autonomic nervous system consists of two divisions that act on our body organs with opposing effects (FIGURE 48.18). Activation of the sympathetic division correlates with arousal and energy generation: the heart beats faster, the liver converts glycogen to glucose, bronchi of the lungs dilate and support increased gas exchange, digestion is inhibited, and secretion of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla is stimulated. Activity of the parasympathetic division causes approximately the mirror image of this: a calming and a return to emphasis on self-maintenance functions. For example, activity of parasympathetic nerves decreases heart rate and energy storage and also enhances digestion. When sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves innervate the same organ, they often (but not always) have antagonistic (opposite) effects.

The somatic and autonomic nervous systems often cooperate in maintaining homeostasis. In response to a drop in temperature, for example, the hypothalamus of the brain signals the autonomic nervous system to constrict surface blood vessels, which reduces heat loss; at the same time the hypothalamus signals the somatic nervous system and causes shivering.





 Embryonic development of the vertebrate brain reflects its evolution from three anterior bulges of the neural tube

We begin studying the vertebrate brain by examining its embryonic development from the neural tube (see FIGURE 47.11). In all vertebrates, three bilaterally symmetrical, anterior bulges of the dorsal hollow nerve cord--the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain--become evident as the neural tube differentiates (FIGURE 48.19a). In the course of vertebrate evolution, the brain became further divided structurally and functionally. This regionalization provided additional capacity for complex integration, with the forebrain becoming much larger in birds and mammals than in fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. The cerebrum, the most sophisticated center of homeostatic control and integration, is an outgrowth of the forebrain that surrounds many of the older brain regions.

Fig 48-19. Embryonic development of the brain.

By the fifth week of human embryonic development, five brain regions have formed from the three primary bulges (FIGURE 48.19b). Two of these regions, the telencephalon and the diencephalon, develop from the forebrain. A single region, the mesencephalon, develops from the midbrain (and is also called the midbrain in the adult). Two regions, called the metencephalon and myelencephalon, develop from the hindbrain.

As a human brain develops further, the most profound changes occur in the telencephalon, the division of the forebrain that gives rise to the cerebrum (FIGURE 48.19c). Rapid, expansive growth of this region during the second and third months creates the two halves of the cerebrum, called the right and left cerebral hemispheres, which extend over and around many of the other brain centers. In the adult, the cerebral hemispheres include white matter (tracts of axons), internal gray matter (nuclei, or clusters of neuron cell bodies), and a highly convoluted outer region of gray matter called the cerebral cortex. Major brain centers that develop from the diencephalon--the division of the forebrain that evolved earliest in vertebrate history--are the thalamus, epithalamus, and hypothalamus.

The three regions derived from the midbrain and hindbrain give rise to structures deep within the brain that are collectively called the brainstem. The adult brainstem consists of the midbrain (from the mesencephalon), the pons (from the metencephalon), and the medulla oblongata (from the myelencephalon). The metencephalon also gives rise to another major brain center, the cerebellum, which is not part of the brain stem. FIGURE 48.20 reviews brain anatomy in a three-dimensional view.

 Evolutionarily older structures of the vertebrate brain regulate essential automatic and integrative functions

The Brainstem

The brainstem, sometimes called the "lower brain," forms a stalk with caplike swellings at the anterior end of the spinal cord. The three parts of the brainstem--the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain--are derived from the embryonic hindbrain and midbrain (see FIGURE 48.19). They function in homeostasis, coordination of movement, and conduction of information to higher brain centers.

The Medulla and Pons. Several centers in the brainstem contain nerve cell bodies that send axons to many different areas of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, releasing neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. These signals from the brainstem cause changes in attention, alertness, appetite, and motivation. The medulla oblongata, commonly called the medulla, contains centers that control several visceral (automatic, homeostatic) functions, including breathing, heart and blood vessel activity, swallowing, vomiting, and digestion. The pons also participates in some of these activities, having nuclei that regulate the breathing centers in the medulla, for example.

All the bundles of axons carrying sensory information to and motor instructions from higher brain regions pass through the brainstem, making data conduction one of the most important functions of the medulla and pons. The brainstem also helps coordinate large-scale body movements such as walking. Most of the descending axons carrying instructions about movement to the spinal cord from the midbrain and forebrain cross from one side of the CNS to the other as they pass through the medulla. As a result, the right side of the brain controls much of the movement of the left side of the body, and vice versa.

The Midbrain.The midbrain contains centers for the receipt and integration of several types of sensory information. It also serves as a projection center, sending coded sensory information along neurons to specific regions of the forebrain. Prominent nuclei of the midbrain are the inferior and superior colliculi, which are part of the auditory and visual systems, respectively. All fibers involved in hearing either terminate in or pass through the inferior colliculi. In nonmammalian vertebrates, the superior colliculi take the form of prominent optic lobes and may be the only visual centers. In mammals, vision is integrated in the cerebrum, leaving the superior colliculi to coordinate visual reflexes, such as automatically turning your head when your peripheral vision picks up something moving toward you from the side.

The Reticular System, Arousal, and Sleep

As anyone who has sat through a lecture on a warm spring day knows, attentiveness and mental alertness vary from moment to moment. Arousal is a state of awareness of the external world. The counterpart of arousal is sleep, when an individual continues to receive external stimuli but is not conscious of them. Sleep and arousal are controlled by several centers in the the brainstem and cerebrum.

A system of neurons called the reticular formation, containing over 90 separate nuclei, passes through the core of the brain stem (FIGURE 48.21). Part of the reticular formation, the reticular activating system (RAS), regulates sleep and arousal. Acting as a sensory filter, the RAS selects which information reaches the cerebral cortex, and the more input the cortex receives, the more alert and aware a person is. But arousal is not just a generalized phenomenon; certain stimuli can be ignored while the brain is actively processing other input. Also, specific centers in the brain stem regulate sleep and wakefulness. The pons and medulla contain nuclei that cause sleep when stimulated, and the midbrain has a center that causes arousal. Serotonin may be the neurotransmitter of the sleep-producing centers. Drinking milk before bedtime may induce sleep because milk contains large amounts of tryptophan, the amino acid from which serotonin is synthesized.

Fig 48-21. The reticular formation. This system of over 90 separate nuclei extends through the brainstem. The reticular formation receives input from sensory receptors (blue arrows). Working closely with the cerebral cortex (green arrows), it prevents sensory overload, filtering out familiar and repetitive information that constantly enters the nervous system. Part of this filtering system, the reticular activating system (RAS), is a vital link in determining states of arousal and consciousness.

Sleep and wakefulness produce different patterns in the electrical activity of the brain, which can be recorded in an electroencephalogram, or EEG (FIGURE 48.22). As a general rule, the less mental activity taking place, the more synchronous the brain waves of the EEG. When a healthy person is lying quietly with closed eyes, slow and synchronous alpha waves predominate. When the eyes are opened or the person solves a complex problem, faster beta waves take over, indicating desynchronization of the parts of the brain.

Fig 48-22. Brain waves recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG).

A sleeping person's EEG reflects the fact that sleep is a dynamic process. In the early stages, theta waves, more irregular than beta waves, often predominate. Deeper sleep produces delta waves, which are quite slow and highly synchronized. Deep sleep also includes periods when a desynchronized EEG reminiscent of wakefulness occurs. During these periods, called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the eyes move actively across the visual field behind closed lids. Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Like sleep, dreaming has been ascribed magical or prophetic importance, but its true function remains unknown.

The question of why we sleep remains a compelling research problem. All birds and mammals sleep and show a characteristic sleep-wake cycle. One hypothesis is that sleep is involved in the consolidation of learning and memory, and experiments show that regions of the brain activated during a learning task can become active again during sleep.

The Cerebellum

The cerebellum develops from part of the metencephalon (see FIGURE 48.19). It functions in coordination and error-checking during motor, perceptual, and cognitive performances. There is strong evidence that the cerebellum is involved in learning and remembering motor responses, because such learning can be blocked by damage to one of its major subdivisions. The cerebellum receives sensory information about the position of the joints and the length of the muscles, as well as information from the auditory and visual systems. It also receives input from the motor pathways, telling it which actions are being commanded from the cerebrum. The cerebellum uses this information to provide automatic coordination of movements and balance. Hand-eye coordination is one example of such a function. If the cerebellum is damaged, the eyes can follow a moving object, but they will not stop at the same place as the object.

The Thalamus and Hypothalamus

The embryonic diencephalon, a division of the forebrain, develops into three adult brain regions: the epithalamus, thalamus, and the hypothalamus (see FIGURE 48.19). The epithalamus includes a choroid plexus, one of several clusters of capillaries that produce cerebrospinal fluid. The epithalamus also has a tiny projection, the pineal gland. The endocrine function of the pineal gland was described in Chapter 45. The thalamus and hypothalamus are major integrating centers.

The thalamus is the main input center for sensory information going to the cerebrum and the main output center for motor information leaving the cerebrum. It contains many different nuclei, each one dedicated to sensory information of a particular type. Incoming information from all the senses is sorted out in the thalamus and sent on to the appropriate higher brain centers for further interpretation and integration. The thalamus also receives input from the cerebrum and other parts of the brain that regulate emotion and arousal.

Although it weighs only a few grams, the hypothalamus is one of the most important brain regions for homeostatic regulation. We saw in Chapter 45 that the hypothalamus is the source of two sets of hormones, posterior pituitary hormones and releasing hormones that act on the anterior pituitary (see FIGURE 45.6). The hypothalmus contains the body's thermostat, as well as centers for regulating hunger, thirst, and many other basic survival mechanisms. Hypothalamic nuclei also play a role in sexual and mating behaviors, the fight-or-flight response, and pleasure. Stimulation of specific centers can cause what are known as "pure" behaviors. For example, rats placed in an experimental situation where they can press a lever to stimulate a "pleasure" center will do so to the exclusion of eating and drinking. Stimulation of another area can produce rage.

The Hypothalamus and Circadian Rhythms.Animals, including humans, exhibit all kinds of regularly repeated, rhythmic behaviors. What maintains our daily rhythms--when, for example, we sleep, our blood pressure is highest, or our sex drive peaks? Many animals exhibit seasonal rhythms, reproducing or migrating only in the spring or fall, for instance. We have already discussed circadian (daily) and seasonal rhythms in plants (see Chapter 39).

Numerous studies have assessed the relative importance of external cues and internal timekeepers in maintaining rhythmic behavior. These studies show that circadian rhythms usually have a strong internal component, referred to as a biological clock. Locating the internal mechanisms responsible for behavioral rhythms has been challenging for researchers. An early hypothesis that the location of these control mechanisms varies across taxonomic boundaries has proved true. For instance, fruit flies (Drosophila) appear to have many biological clocks throughout their body and at the outer edges of their wings. In mammals, a pair of structures called the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus functions as a biological clock. Experiments with rodents have revealed that the cells of the SCN produce specific proteins in response to changing light-dark cycles. The function of this or any other biological clock may be the regulation of a variety of physiological processes, such as hormone release, hunger, and heightened sensitivity to external stimuli that motivate specific rhythmic behaviors.

Researchers have also investigated the role of external cues in circadian rhythms. Usually, a clock's rhythm does not exactly match events in the environment, and external cues are necessary to keep cycles timed to the outside world. Light is a common external cue for circadian rhythms; visual information received by the SCN via sensory neurons from the eyes enables the mammalian clock to remain synchronized with the natural cycles of day length and darkness. For example, activity of the North American flying squirrel normally begins with the onset of darkness and ends at dawn, which suggests that light is an important external cue. If a squirrel is placed in constant light or constant darkness, its rhythmic activity continues, but the duration of its activity cycle (one period of activity plus one period of inactivity) falls a little more out of sync with the outside world each day (FIGURE 48.23). The squirrel's internal clock continues to run without external cues, but on its own cycle, which turns out to be 21 minutes shorter than 24 hours. External cues, such as day length and night length, adjust the clock, so that the rhythmic behavior it controls is synchronized with the outside world.

Fig 48-23. Activity rhythms in a nocturnal mammal. An inhabitant of forests in North America, the northern flying squirrel is active at night and usually sleeps in a nest cavity in a hollow tree from dawn to dusk. (a) To study its activity rhythms, researchers have placed flying squirrels in cages containing an exercise wheel in which a squirrel can run. The wheel is connected to a chart recorder, which moves graph paper past a pen at a fixed speed. When a squirrel runs on the wheel, the pen is activated and marks the graph paper. The graphs shown in (b) and (c) trace the activity of two flying squirrels kept under different light conditions for 23 days. The longer black bars indicate periods of extended activity. (b) This graph shows the activity pattern of a squirrel exposed to 12 hours of darkness, simulating natural conditions. (c) This graph shows the activity pattern of a squirrel held in constant darkness for 23 days. Although the activity of both squirrels remained rhythmic throughout the recording period, with a distinct period of extended activity every day, the high-activity period of the squirrel shifted each day (actually by 21 minutes). After 23 days its period of greatest activity was nearly 8 hours out of synchronization with the actual time of day. (The small magenta arrows indicate when the period of greatest activity began on days 1 and 23.) Experiments with flying squirrels, humans, and other animals show that environmental cues are needed to keep biological clocks tuned to external conditions.

Human circadian rhythms have been studied by placing individuals in comfortable living quarters deep underground, where they could make their own schedules with no external cues of any kind. Under these free-running conditions (see Chapter 39), the biological clock of humans seems to have a period of about 25 hours, but with much individual variation. Like other animals, humans use external cues to adjust their rhythms to 24 hours in the real world.





 The cerebrum is the most highly evolved structure of the mammalian brain

The cerebrum develops from the embryonic telencephalon, an outgrowth of the forebrain that arose early in vertebrate evolution as a region supporting olfactory reception as well as auditory and visual centers. The cerebrum is divided into right and left cerebral hemispheres (FIGURE 48.24a). Each hemisphere consists of an outer covering of gray matter, the cerebral cortex, mentioned earlier; internal white matter; and a cluster of nuclei called basal nuclei deep within the white matter. The basal nuclei are important centers for planning and learning movement sequences. Damage in this region can cause devastating motor disorders in humans such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, or even render a person passive and immobile because the nuclei no longer allow motor impulses to be sent to the muscles.

Fig 48-24. Structure and functional areas of the cerebrum. (a) This rear view of the human brain shows the bilateral nature of the cerebral hemispheres. The corpus collosum (large fiber tracts connecting the hemispheres) and basal nuclei (ganglia) are completely covered (and not visible from the surface) by the convoluted gray matter of the cerebral cortex. (b) The surface of each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four lobes. (A fifth lobe, the insula, located within the fold separating the temporal and parietal lobes, is not shown in this drawing of the left hemisphere.) Specialized functions are localized in each lobe. The association areas of the left hemisphere have different functions than those of the right hemisphere.

The cerebral cortex ("gray matter") is the largest and most complex part of the mammalian brain, and the part that has changed the most during vertebrate evolution. Some of its components are also found in the brains of reptiles, which share a common ancestor with mammals (see FIGURE 34.20). Unique to mammals, however, is the neocortex, an additional outer layer of cortex consisting of six sheets of neurons running tangential to the brain surface. Among mammals, greater cognitive abilities and more sophisticated behavior are associated with the relative size of the cerebral cortex and the presence of convolutions that increase the surface area of the neocortex. Although less than 5 mm thick, the human neocortex has a surface area of about 0.5 m2 and accounts for about 80%  of the total brain mass. Nonhuman primates and cetaceans (whales and porpoises, for example) also have exceptionally large and complex neocortices. In fact, the surface area (relative to body size) of a porpoise's neocortex is second only to that of a human.

Like the rest of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex is divided into right and left sides, each of which is responsible for the opposite half of the body. The left hemisphere receives information from, and controls the movement of, the right side of the body, and vice versa. A thick band of fibers (cerebral white matter) known as the corpus callosum communicates between the right and left cerebral hemispheres (see FIGURE 48.24a).

In the discussion of cerebral functions that follows, the words cognition and cognitive will come up often. Cognition is defined as the process of knowing, including both awareness and judgment. Thus, the cognitive functions of the brain include learning, decision making, consciousness, and an integrated sensory awareness of the surroundings.





 Regions of the cerebrum are specialized for different functions

Each side of the cerebral cortex is customarily described as having four lobes, called the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes. Researchers have identified a number of functional areas within each lobe (FIGURE 48.24b). These areas include primary sensory areas for input of different kinds of sensory information, and association areas that integrate the input with information from other parts of the brain.

Two functional cortical areas, the primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex, form the boundary between the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe. The motor cortex functions mainly in sending commands to the skeletal muscles, signaling appropriate responses to any sensory stimuli. The somatosensory cortex receives and partially integrates signals from touch, pain, pressure, and temperature receptors throughout the body. The proportion of motor or somatosensory cortex devoted to a particular part of the body is correlated with the relative importance of sensory or motor information for that part of the body (FIGURE 48.25).

Fig 48-25. Primary motor and somatosensory areas of the human cerebral cortex. In these cross-sectional maps of the cortex, the surface area devoted to each body part is symbolized by the relative sizes of the body parts in the cartoon.

Integrative Function of the Association Areas

Sensory information coming into the cortex, mainly via the thalamus, is first directed to primary sensory areas within the lobes: visual information to the occipital lobe; auditory input to the temporal lobe; and somatosensory information about touch, pain, pressure, temperature, and the position of muscles and limbs to the parietal lobe (see FIGURE 48.24b). Information about taste goes to a separate sensory region of the parietal lobe. Olfactory information is sent first to "primitive" regions of the cortex and then via the thalamus to an interior region of the frontal lobe (by "primitive" regions here, we mean cerebral regions that are similar between mammals and reptiles). All this information is then passed to the adjacent association areas, which integrate ("associate") the input from different types of senses, assess the significance of the overall sensory input, and then transmit signals to still more association areas, these located in the frontal lobes. The association regions of the frontal lobes then compose an appropriate motor response plan, which is used by the primary motor cortex to direct the movement of skeletal muscles.

The major increase in the size of the neocortex that occurred during mammalian evolution expanded the association areas that integrate higher cognitive functions that make more complex behavior and learning possible. The cortical surface of a rat's brain is relatively smooth and is occupied mainly by primary sensory areas, which receive direct input from sensory receptors. In contrast, the cortical surface of our brains is much more convoluted and consists mainly of association regions. Regional specializations in this association cortex first appear during brain development as infants and children learn routines for sensing and acting. While these regional specializations are roughly the same in different humans, damage to one brain area early in development can frequently cause redirection of its normal functions to other areas. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this is observed in some human infants with intractable epilepsy who are treated by removing the entire right or left cerebral hemisphere. Amazingly, the remaining hemisphere takes over most of the functions normally provided by two hemispheres. Some plasticity is maintained in adult brains, for they can sometimes recover from damage to a portion of the cerebral cortex by developing or using new circuits.

Lateralization of Brain Function

During an infant's or child's brain development, competing functions segregate and displace each other into the cortex of opposite cerebral hemispheres. The left hemisphere becomes most adept at language, math, logic operations, and the processing of serial sequences of information. It has a bias for the detailed, speed-optimized activities required for skeletal motor control and processing of fine visual and auditory details. The right hemisphere is stronger at pattern recognition, face recognition, spatial relations, nonverbal ideation, emotional processing in general, and parallel processing of many kinds of information. Understanding and generating the stress and intonation patterns of speech that convey its emotional content emphasizes right-hemisphere function, as does music. The right hemisphere appears to specialize in perception of the relationship between images and the whole context in which they occur, whereas the left hemisphere is better at focused perception. While working with their hands, most right-handed people use the left hand (right hemisphere) for context or holding and use the right hand (left hemisphere) for fine detailed movement.

Language and Speech

The systematic and detailed mapping of higher cognitive functions to specific brain areas began in the 19th century when physicians performed post-mortem examinations of the brains of patients with language impairments. Those who could understand language but not speak usually had damage to a frontal lobe area, now called Broca's area, just in front of motor cortex controlling face and lips. Studies of brain activity using a modern imaging technology called PET (for positron emission tomography) have confirmed that Broca's area is active during generation of speech (FIGURE 48.26, lower left image). Autopsies during the 19th century also suggested that damage to a posterior portion of the temporal lobe, now called Wernicke's area (upper left image of FIGURE 48.26), could abolish the ability to comprehend speech but leave speech generation intact.

Fig 48-26. Mapping language areas of the cerebral cortex. A modern imaging technology called PET scanning maps regions of an organ that are most metabolically active. These four computer-generated brain maps show "hot spots" of activity in the brain of one individual under four different conditions, all related to speech.

More detailed modern studies, both of brain lesions and imaging of brain activity, have now demonstrated that language is processed by multiple areas in the cortex. An instruction to simply read a printed word out loud activates the visual cortex (upper right image of FIGURE 48.26) and Broca's area. Frontal and temporal areas become active when meaning must be attached to words, as in generating verbs to go with nouns or in grouping together related words or concepts (FIGURE 48.26, lower right image). Researchers can monitor the effect of practice on this cognitive development. An instruction to associate a verb with each noun projected on a screen initially activates frontal lobes. But after 15 minutes of practice, the activation has contracted mainly to those areas used in simply reading a word out loud. This illustrates an important principle of brain function: novel stimuli or instructions cause the greatest mobilization of brain areas and resources. Once a situation or procedure has become familiar, it is accommodated by a much lower level of brain activity.

Emotions

Two components of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex, are common to reptiles and mammals. In mammals, these structures, together with some inner portions of the cortex's lobes and sections of the thalamus and hypothalamus, form a ring around the brainstem called the limbic system (FIGURE 48.27, p. 1050). By interacting with sensory areas of the neocortex and other higher brain centers, the limbic system generates the feelings we generally call emotions.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 48-27. The limbic system. Portions of the diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) and inner parts of the cerebral cortex, including the amygdala and hippocampus, make up this functional center of human emotions and memory. Signals from the nose enter the brain through the olfactory bulb, which is part of the limbic system. Other sensory information enters the limbic system via other parts of the cerebral cortex (arrows). A "higher" center of integration in the cerebrum, the prefrontal cortex, apparently consults the limbic system and other brain centers in processing and retrieving memories and may use memories to modify behavior.

The limbic system is central to some of the behaviors, such as the extended nurturing of infants and an emotional bonding to other individuals, that distinguish mammals from most reptiles and amphibians. The limbic system mediates primary emotions that manifest in such behaviors as laughing and crying. But the system also attaches emotional "feelings" to basic survival-related programs of the brainstem, such as feeding, aggression, and sexuality.

Structures of the emotional brain centered in the limbic system form early in development, and provide a foundation for the higher cognitive functions that appear later during the development of neocortical areas. We, along with other primates, are born with emotional brain circuits prepared to support bonding to a caretaker, to recognize the crude elements of a human face, to have visual and vocal interactions with that caretaker, and to express fear, distress and anger. Learning and memory processes are then set in motion to build a history of what sensing and motor actions "work" in obtaining warmth and food. We also begin very early to distinguish "right" from "wrong"--for example, by causing happy or angry facial or vocal expressions from a caretaker. The amygdala, a nucleus in the temporal lobe (see FIGURE 48.27), is central in recognizing the emotional content of facial expressions and laying down emotional memories.

This emotional memory system seems to appear earlier in development than the system that supports explicit recall of events, which requires another limbic structure, the hippocampus. Adults who learn to avoid an aversive situation, such as a picture that is always followed by a mild electric shock, remember the picture and experience autonomic arousal--as measured by heart rate increase or sweating--if the picture is presented again. Some adults with damage to the hippocampus report that they do not recognize the picture, but the autonomic arousal mediated by the amygdala still occurs, for the emotional memory mediated by this structure is still intact. Conversely, other patients with damage just to the amygdala do not exhibit the autonomic reactions but recall the picture, because the hippocampus which is involved in explicit memory is functioning.

As children develop, primary emotions such as pleasure and fear are associated with different situations in a process that requires portions of the neocortex, especially the frontal lobes. The existence of learning processes by which we accumulate emotional reactions to different situations are revealed by their disruption in some patients who have lesions or tumors in their frontal lobes. Their behavior is superficially normal most of the time--intellect and memory seem intact--but motivation, foresight, goal formation, and decision making are flawed. These patients are subject to bursts of immodest, impolite, or other inappropriate behaviors; they act almost as though their free will had been taken from them. Their emotions and feelings also are diminished. Frontal lobotomies, which disrupt the connection between the frontal lobes and the limbic system, were once performed widely to treat severe emotional disorders. However, the resulting docility was usually accompanied by a loss of the ability to concentrate, plan, and work toward goals, and thus drug therapy has replaced lobotomy for treating such severely ill individuals.

Memory and Learning

Our daily life is a constant checking of what is happening right now against what just happened a few moments ago. We hold information, anticipations, or goals for a time in short-term memory locations in the frontal lobes and then release them if they become irrelevant. Should we wish to retain knowledge of a face or a phone number, the mechanisms of long-term memory are activated in a process that requires the hippocampus, part of the limbic system (see FIGURE 48.27). If we later need to remember a name or number, we can fetch it from that long-term memory and place it back in our working memory. The transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory is enhanced by rehearsal ("practice makes perfect"), positive or negative emotional states mediated by the amygdala, and the association of new data with data previously learned and stored in long-term memory (it's easier to learn a new card game if you already have "card sense" from playing other games).

Many sensory and motor association areas of the cerebral cortex outside the classical language areas are involved in storing and retrieving words and images from our mental dictionary. Studies of patients with brain lesions and imaging studies on unimpaired patients suggest, for example, that knowledge of unique persons is associated with the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe, knowledge of animals with activity in the middle lower part of this lobe, and knowledge of tools with the lower posterior part.

The memorization of phone numbers, facts, and places--which can be very rapid and may require only one exposure to the relevant item--may rely mainly on rapid changes in the strength of existing nerve connections. In contrast, the slow learning and remembering of skills and procedures, such as a person's experience when trying to improve his or her tennis game, appear to involve cellular mechanisms very similar to those responsible for brain growth and development. Nerve cells actually make new connections. Skill memories usually involve motor activities that are learned by repetition without consciously remembering specific information. You perform learned motor skills, such as walking, tying your shoes, riding a bicycle, or writing without consciously recalling the individual steps required to do these tasks correctly. Once a skill memory is learned, it is difficult to unlearn. For example, a person who has played tennis for years with a self-taught, awkward backhand has a much tougher time learning the correct form than a beginner just learning the game. Bad habits, as we know, are difficult to break.

Many exciting new experiments are documenting changes in gene expression and synaptic molecules that correlate with memory formation. Functional changes at certain synapses in the hippocampus and amygdala seem to be directly related to memory storage and emotional conditioning. One kind of change, called long-term depression (LTD), is decreased responsiveness to an action potential by a postsynaptic cell. LTD is induced by repeated, weak stimulation. A second kind of synaptic change, called long-term potentiation (LTP), is an enhanced responsiveness to action potentials by a postsynaptic cell. It can result when a presynaptic cell bombards a synapse with a series of brief, repeated action potentials that strongly depolarize the postsynaptic membrane. With LTP established, a single action potential from the presynaptic cell has a much greater effect at the synapse than before. Lasting for a matter of hours, days, or weeks, depending on the number and frequency of repeated action potentials, LTP may be what happens when a memory is being stored or when learning takes place. LTP is associated with the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate by the presynaptic cell. Glutamate binds with a specific class of receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, opening gated channels that are highly permeable to calcium ions (Ca2+). In turn, the Ca2+ triggers a cascade of enzyme activity in the postsynaptic cell, making it more responsive to stimulation.

Human Consciousness

When we use the word consciousness, we are usually referring to our own human version of self-consciousness, in which we experience ourselves as not only sensing, acting, and feeling in the present moment but also thinking about the past and the future. How many of these capabilities extend to other animals is a subject of a vigorous debate (see Chapter 51). Until relatively recently the study of human consciousness has been considered outside the province of hard science, more appropriate as a subject for philosophy and religion. This situation is changing as we learn more about the brain activities that underlie our behaviors. Brain imaging studies are showing changes in neuronal activity that correlate with conscious perceptual choices, unconscious versus conscious processing, retrieval of memories, and engaging working memory to plan for the future. There is a growing consensus that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain that recruits activities in many areas of the cortex. Several models suggest a scanning mechanism that repetitively sweeps across the brain to unite many of these disparate processes into a unified conscious moment. Rather than just being a matter of describing the details of how the areas described above are put together, approaching consciousness may also require the understanding of dynamic whole-brain patterns of activity that bear no more direct relationship to individual nerve cells than do hurricanes to their constituent water molecules.

Understanding whole-brain phenomena such as consciousness represents one end of the spectrum of questions about nervous systems. At the other (microscopic) end is a frontier where neuroscientists are studying how neurons develop and organize into networks.





 Research on neuron development and neural stem cells may lead to new approaches for treating CNS injuries and diseases

Unlike the peripheral nervous system, the mammalian central nervous system cannot repair itself when damaged or assaulted by disease. The human brain can make new connections between surviving neurons and thus sometimes compensate for damage, as in the remarkable recoveries of some stroke victims. Generally speaking, however, spinal cord injuries, strokes, brain injuries, and diseases that destroy brain cells, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer-s, have devastating effects. Current research on nerve cell development and the discovery of neural stem cells enhance our fundamental knowledge of the nervous system and may one day make it possible for physicians to repair or replace damaged neurons.

Nerve Cell Development

One of the key questions in neurobiology is how certain cells in a developing animal differentiate into neurons, migrate to their proper location, grow axons to specific places, and make synapses with the proper target cells. How is this accomplished without ending up with a useless tangle of neurons? The labs of Corey Goodman (University of California, Berkeley) and Marc Tessier-Lavigne (University of California, San Francisco) study how neurons find their way during development of the central nervous system. Their work combines elements of cell-to-cell communication (Chapter 11), control of gene expression (Chapter 19), and the genetic basis of development (Chapter 21).

To reach their target cells, axons must grow anywhere from a few microns up to a meter in length (for example, from the human spinal cord to the foot). Axons do not follow a straight path from point A to point B; rather, molecular signposts along the way direct and redirect the growing axon in a series of mid-course corrections that result in a meandering, but not random, trek. The responsive region at the leading edge of the growing axon is called the growth cone. Signal molecules released by target cells bind to receptors on the plasma membrane of the growth cone, triggering a signal-transduction pathway (FIGURE 48.28). The response of the axon may be to grow toward the source of the signal molecules (attraction) or grow away from the source (repulsion). Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the axon's growth cone also play a role; they attach to complementary cell adhesion molecules on surrounding cells that provide tracks for the growing axon to follow. Nerve growth factor released by astrocytes and growth-promoting proteins produced by the neurons themselves contribute to the process by stimulating growth of axons.

Fig 48-28. How do developing axons know which way to go? The region at the leading edge of a developing axon is called the growth cone; this area displays various receptors and cell adhesion molecules that bind to guidance signals from surrounding cells. This figure illustrates a few of the factors involved in axon guidance. In the examples shown here, (a) interneurons are induced to cross the midline of the spinal cord whereas (b) motor neurons are induced to grow away from the spinal cord, eventually to synapse with muscle or gland cells.

Goodman, Tessier-Lavigne, and their colleagues have found the genes, gene products, and process of axon guidance to be remarkably similar in nematode worms (C. elegans), insects (Drosophila), and vertebrates, indicating evolutionary conservation of the genes and basic mechanism for this complex process.

Development occurs in a space and time sequence that would seem difficult to replicate in order to repair or replace neurons in humans with damaged nervous systems. The growing axon expresses different genes at different times during its development, and is influenced by surrounding cells that it moves away from. Work continues on deciphering these developmental mechanisms, however, with the ultimate goal of repairing damaged neurological tissue. Using the right combination of attractants, repellants, growth-associated proteins, and growth factors, researchers hope to coax damaged axons to regrow, following the correct pathway and forming connections with the correct targets.

Neural Stem Cells

Until 1998, it was "common knowledge" that you were born with all the brain cells you would ever have. In that year, however, Fred Gage (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California) and Peter Ericksson (Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G&ouml;teborg, Sweden) made a startling announcement: the human brain does produce new nerve cells in adulthood. Newly-divided cells were found in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory and learning (see FIGURE 48.27). It is not clear what function these new cells play in the human brain. However, mice that live in stimulating environments and run on exercise wheels have more new brain cells in their hippocampus and perform better on learning tasks than genetically-identical mice who live in standard cages. Perhaps people can also improve their brain capacity by stimulating their minds and exercising their bodies, resulting in a greater capacity for learning.

The discovery of young brain cells in adult brains came about because of a bit of scientific serendipity and the generosity of some terminally ill cancer patients. Ericksson had been on sabbatical in Gage's lab, where the chemical marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected in mice to label the DNA of dividing cells. In a postmortem study, the brains of the mice were examined for new brain cells, which were identified by the marker. After Ericksson returned to Sweden for clinical work, he was on call with a cancer specialist who happened to mention that a group of terminally ill cancer patients was being given bromodeoxyuridine as part of a study to monitor tumor growth. Ericksson recognized this substance as the marker being used to look for new brain cells in the Gage lab. The patients agreed to donate their brains to science upon their death, and new neurons were found in all the patients.

Mature brain cells, with their extensive processes and intricate connections to other cells, clearly are not able to undergo cell division. Therefore, the new brain cells must have come from stem cells. Recall from Chapter 21 that stem cells are relatively unspecialized cells that continually divide. Some offspring cells may differentiate into specialized cells under the right conditions, while cell division retains a supply of undifferentiated cells.

One of the difficulties of conducting research on stem cells is finding a source of human stem cells. Various ethical and political issues surround the use of embryonic stem cells. In addition to the stem cells of an early embryo, certain tissues of an adult also have stem cells, though they may be less developmentally versatile than embryonic stem cells. For example, the bone marrow has stem cells that can differentiate into the various kinds of blood cells (see FIGURE 42.15). The existence of stem cells in the brain, however, is an exciting surprise.

In May 2001, Gage and his colleagues announced that they had cultured neural progenitor cells from the brains of recently-deceased individuals and surgical tissue samples. The term "progenitor" refers to the fact that these stem cells are committed to becoming nerve cells; they are not as "plastic" as embryonic stem cells. In the lab, the neural progenitor cells divided 30-70 times and differentiated into neurons and astrocytes (FIGURE 48.29). Gage noted, "These results confirm that the adult human brain contains cells that can continue to divide and differentiate."

One of the goals of further research is to find a way to induce the body's own neural progenitor cells to differentiate into glia or specific types of neurons when and where they are needed. Also, cultured neural progenitor cells could be transplanted into damaged neurological tissue.

In addition to the studies we-ve described here, many other researchers are exploring various approaches to preventing and treating central nervous system disorders and injuries.

In the next chapter we examine in more detail the input and output elements of the nervous system--sensory receptors and motor effectors.

In the gathering dusk a male moth's antennae detect the chemical attractant of a female moth somewhere upwind. The male takes to the air, following the scent trail toward the female. Suddenly, vibration sensors in the moth's abdomen signal the presence of ultrasonic chirps of a rapidly approaching bat. The bat's sonar enables the mammal to locate moths and other flying insect prey. Reflexively, the moth's nervous system alters the motor output to its wing muscles, sending the insect into an evasive spiral toward the ground. Although it is probably too late for the moth in the photograph on this page, many moths can escape because they can detect a bat's sonar about 30 m away. The bat has to be within 3 m to sense the moth, but since the bat flies faster, it may still have time to detect, home in, and catch its prey.

The outcome of this interaction depends on the abilities of both predator and prey to sense important environmental stimuli and to produce appropriate coordinated movement. Although not all of an animal's moment-by-moment interactions with its environment are as dramatic as such predator-prey struggles, the detection and processing of sensory information and the generation of motor output provide the physiological basis for all animal behavior.

In Chapter 48 we examined how the nervous system transmits and integrates sensory and motor information, finishing with a description of our human brains. We start this chapter with a brief overview of how sensory and motor information is processed in our brains. Then we will examine in a number of different animal groups both the sensory receptors that receive information from the environment and also the structure and function of muscles, the motor effectors that bring about movement in response to that information. We will also study skeletons in the context of body movement.





SENSING, ACTING, AND BRAINS

 

 The brain's processing of sensory input and motor output is cyclical rather than linear







INTRODUCTION TO SENSORY RECEPTION

 

 Sensory receptors transduce stimulus energy and transmit signals to the nervous system



 

 Sensory receptors are categorized by the type of energy they transduce



As you learned in Chapter 48, information is transmitted through the nervous system in the form of nerve impulses, or action potentials, which are all-or-none events (see FIGURE 48.8c). An action potential triggered by light striking the eye is the same as an action potential triggered by air vibrating in the ear. The ability to distinguish any type of stimulus, such as sight or sound, depends on the part of the brain that receives the signal. What matters is where impulses go, not what triggers them.

Action potentials that reach the brain via sensory neurons are called sensations. Once the brain is aware of sensations, it interprets them, giving us the perception of the stimuli. Perceptions, such as colors, smells, sounds, and tastes, are constructions of the brain and do not exist outside it. So, if a tree falls and no one is present to hear it, is there a sound? The fall certainly produces pressure waves in the air, but if sound is defined as a perception, then there is none unless sensory receptors detect the waves and an animal's brain perceives them.





PHOTORECEPTORS AND VISION

 

 A diversity of photoreceptors has evolved among invertebrates



 

 Vertebrates have single-lens eyes



 

 The light-absorbing pigment rhodopsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway



 

 The retina assists the cerebral cortex in processing visual information



A great variety of light detectors has evolved in the animal kingdom, from simple clusters of cells that detect only the direction and intensity of light to complex organs that form images. Despite their diversity, all photoreceptors contain similar pigment molecules that absorb light, and most, if not all, photoreceptors in the animal kingdom may be homologous. Animals as diverse as flatworms, annelids, arthropods, and vertebrates have some of the same, ancient genes associated with the development of photoreceptors in embryos. Thus, the genetic underpinnings of all photoreceptors may have evolved in the earliest bilateral animals (see Chapter 33). The actual eyes that form in an animal depend on developmental patterns regulated by genetic mechanisms that evolved later in the animal's taxonomic group, and whose effects appear to be superimposed on the ancient, homologous mechanism.





HEARING AND EQUILIBRIUM

 

 The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear



 

 The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium



 

 A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians



 

 Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive



Hearing and the perception of body equilibrium, or balance, are related in most animals. Both involve the formation of sensations by mechanoreceptors containing hair cells that produce receptor potentials when the hairs are bent by settling particles or moving fluid. In mammals and most other terrestrial vertebrates, the sensory organs for hearing and equilibrium are closely associated within fluid-filled canals in the ear.





CHEMORECEPTION--TASTE AND SMELL

 

 Perceptions of taste and smell are usually interrelated



Many animals use their chemical senses to find mates (as when male silk moths respond to pheromones emitted by females), to recognize territory that has been marked by some chemical substance (as when dogs and cats sniff boundaries that have been staked out by their spraying neighbors), and to help navigate during migration (as when salmon use the unique scent of their streams of origin to return for breeding). Chemical "conversation" is especially important for animals, such as ants and bees, that live in large social groups. In all animals, taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are important in feeding behavior. For example, a hydra begins to swallow when chemoreceptors detect the compound glutathione, which is released from prey captured by the hydra's tentacles.





MOVEMENT AND LOCOMOTION

 

 Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity



 

 Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement



 

 Physical support on land depends on adaptations of body proportions and posture



 

 Muscles move skeletal parts by contracting



 

 Interactions between myosin and actin generate force during muscle contractions



 

 Calcium ions and regulatory proteins control muscle contraction



 

 Diverse body movements require variation in muscle activity



Movement is a hallmark of animals. To catch food, an animal must either move through its environment or move the surrounding water or air past itself. Sessile animals such as sponges and many cnidarians stay put, but they wave tentacles that capture prey or use beating cilia to generate water currents that draw and trap small food particles (see Chapter 33). Most animals, however, are mobile and spend a considerable portion of their time and energy actively searching for food, as well as escaping from danger and looking for mates. Locomotion, or active travel from place to place, is our focus here.





 The brain's processing of sensory input and motor output is cyclical rather than linear

We can trace the origins of sensing and acting back to the appearance, in simple prokaryotes, of cellular structures able to sense pressure or chemicals in the environment and then direct movement in an appropriate direction. These structures have been transformed during evolution into diverse mechanisms specialized to sense different types of energy and generate many different levels of physical movement in response. Alongside the evolution of the wide variety of sensory receptors that we will describe in the first section of this chapter, the brain mechanisms described in Chapter 48 also evolved. These processes in the brain interpret sensory input and organize motor output to the different kinds of effector organs described in the second portion of the chapter.

Although it is customary to think of sensations causing brain changes which then cause action as a linear process--sensing  brain analysis  action--such a description implies that an animal is rather like a computer passively waiting for instructions before it acts. This is not the case. All animals are in constant motion, probing the environment with that motion, sensing the changes that result, and then using the information to generate the next action. This is a continuous cycle rather than a linear sequence, the brain carrying on background activity which is constantly updated as sensing and acting proceed (FIGURE 49.1).

Fig 49-1. Catching a fly ball is no simple feat. From the moment the bat makes contact, a cycle of sensory input, processing in the brain, and responses by muscles eventually place the fielder's glove in the right place at the right time. Brain activity is constantly updated as it senses how the position of the body and glove relative to the ball's flight has been changed by the previous instant's motor output. And, of course, experience (learning and practice) enhance this marvel of coordination.

Sensations begin as different forms of energy such as light, heat, sound, and smells are detected by specialized sensory receptor cells and ultimately converted to action potentials that travel to the brain. In most vertebrates, sensory signals generally go first to the thalamus, the gateway to the cerebral cortex (see FIGURE 48.20). This gateway is influenced by instructions coming back from the cortex selecting which sensory input seems more important at the moment. The information is then sent on to the many parts of the brain that contribute to forming our perceptions, our awareness and interpretation of the stimuli. For example, information relevant to identifying sounds or visual objects streams mainly to regions of the temporal lobes, while information about their motion and location is sent to the parietal lobes. Limbic regions are central in determining the importance of the sensory input to the organism (see FIGURES 48.24b and 48.27). Our memories of similar sounds and objects can strongly influence our final perceptions, so that in some cases we perceive what we expect to hear or see, rather than what is really there. Thus the process of perception starts with a fairly simple input--information about physical sensations carried by action potentials to the brain--and ends with a very complex result that can be biased by our history of sensing.

This description of simple sensations leading to complex perceptions invites a comparison with the subsequent motor actions that drive behaviors. A relatively simple outcome--action potentials in many motor neurons driving the contraction of striated muscles to produce a single coordinated behavior--has an extremely complex beginning. At the same time that information about the location, identity, and meaning of objects in the world streams forward to higher centers in the frontal lobes associated with making behavioral choices, motor-planning regions of the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum are evaluating a vast array of learned skills--movement programs that are potential responses. The single motor behavior chosen for the next moment is the result of a very complex decision-making mechanism.

We considered the complexity of information processing in the brain in Chapter 48, and we wanted to remind you of that complexity at the beginning of this chapter. However, the main purpose of this chapter is not to deal further with these cognitive processes, but rather to examine, in several different invertebrate and vertebrate groups, the beginning and the end of sensing and acting. We start first with sensory processes--how information about the external and internal environment is collected and conveyed to the brain--and then consider the structure and function of muscles that carry out the movement instructions generated by the brain.





 Sensory receptors transduce stimulus energy and transmit signals to the nervous system

Sensations, and the perceptions they evoke in the brain, begin with sensory reception, the detection of the energy of a stimulus by sensory cells. Most sensory receptors are specialized neurons or epithelial cells that exist singly or in groups with other cell types within sensory organs, such as the eyes and ears. Sensory receptors called exteroreceptors detect stimuli outside the body, such as heat, light, pressure, and chemicals. Other sensory receptors called interoreceptors detect stimuli within the body, such as blood pressure and body position.

All stimuli represent forms of energy, and the general function of receptor cells is to convert the energy of stimuli into changes in membrane potentials and then transmit signals to the nervous system. This task consists of four functions: sensory transduction, amplification, transmission, and integration.

Sensory Transduction

The actual detection of a stimulus involves the conversion of stimulus energy into a change in the membrane potential of a receptor cell, a process called sensory transduction. The initial response of the sensory receptor to a stimulus is a change in its membrane permeability, resulting in a graded change in membrane potential called a receptor potential. (Recall from Chapter 48 that a graded potential is a change in the voltage across the membrane that is proportional to the strength of the stimulus.) In some cases a stimulus such as pressure can stretch the membrane and increase ion flow. In other cases, specific receptor molecules on the membrane of a receptor cell open or close gates to ion channels when the stimulus is present. FIGURE 49.2 (p. 1060) illustrates the example of sugar triggering a receptor potential that functions in our sense of taste. We will examine other specific examples of sensory transduction later in the chapter.

Amplification

The strengthening of stimulus energy that is otherwise too weak to be carried into the nervous system is called amplification. Amplification of the signal may occur in accessory structures of a complex sense organ, as when sound waves are enhanced by a factor of more than 20 before reaching the receptors of the inner ear. Amplification also may be a part of the transduction process itself. An action potential conducted from the eye to the brain has about 100,000 times as much energy as the few photons of light that triggered it. Signal transduction pathways in the receptor cells contribute to this amplification (see FIGURE 49.2).

Transmission

Once the energy in the stimulus has been transduced into a receptor potential, transmission, or the conduction of impulses to the CNS (central nervous system), can occur. In some instances, such as in the case of "pain cells," the receptor itself is actually a sensory neuron that conducts action potentials to the CNS. Other receptors are separate cells that must transmit chemical signals (neurotransmitters) across synapses to sensory neurons (see FIGURE 49.2). If the receptor also functions as the sensory neuron, the intensity of the receptor potential will affect the frequency of action potentials that travel as sensations to the CNS. For separate receptor cells, the strength of the stimulus and receptor potential affect the amount of neurotransmitter released by the receptor at its synapse with a sensory neuron, which in turn determines the frequency of action potentials generated by the sensory neuron. Many sensory neurons spontaneously generate signals at a low rate. Therefore, a stimulus does not really switch the production of action potentials on or off; it modulates their frequency (FIGURE 49.2 illustrates this phenomenon). In this way the CNS is sensitive not only to the presence or absence of a stimulus but also to changes in stimulus intensity.

Integration

The processing of information, or integration, begins as soon as information is first received. Signals from receptors are integrated through the summation of graded potentials, as are those within the nervous system. One type of integration by receptor cells is sensory adaptation, a decrease in responsiveness during continued stimulation (not to be confused with the term adaptation as used in an evolutionary context). Without sensory adaptation, you would feel every beat of your heart and every bit of clothing on your body. Receptors are selective in the information they send to the CNS, and adaptation reduces the likelihood that a continuous stimulus will be transmitted.

Another important aspect of sensory integration is the sensitivity of the receptors. The threshold for transduction by receptor cells varies with conditions. For example, the thresholds of glucose receptors in the human mouth can vary over several orders of magnitude of sugar concentration as both the general state of nutrition and the amount of sugar in the diet change.

The integration of sensory information occurs at all levels within the nervous system, and the cellular actions just described are only the first steps. Complex receptors such as the eyes have higher levels of integration as signals converge on sensory nerves, and the CNS further processes all incoming signals.





 Sensory receptors are categorized by the type of energy they transduce

Based on the type of energy they detect (transduce), sensory receptors fall into five categories: mechanoreceptors, pain receptors, thermoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and electromagnetic receptors. One amazing feature of many of these receptors is that they can detect the smallest physical unit of stimulus possible. Most photoreceptors can detect a single quantum (photon) of light, chemoreceptors can detect a single molecule or odorant, and the mechanoreceptor cells of our inner ear can detect a motion of only a few angstroms.

Mechanoreceptors are stimulated by physical deformation caused by such stimuli as pressure, touch, stretch, motion, and sound--all forms of mechanical energy. Bending or stretching of the plasma membrane of a mechanoreceptor cell increases its permeability to both sodium and potassium ions, resulting in a depolarization (receptor potential).

The human sense of touch relies on mechanoreceptors that are actually modified dendrites of sensory neurons (FIGURE 49.3). Receptors that detect light touch are close to the surface of the skin; they transduce very slight inputs of mechanical energy into receptor potentials. Receptors responding to strong pressure and vibrations in the body are in deep skin layers. Other touch receptors detect hair movement--the sensitivity of a cat's whiskers is an example.

Fig 49-3. Sensory receptors in human skin. Each mechanoreceptor is a modified dendrite of a sensory neuron. Most receptors in the inner layer of the skin (dermis) are encapsulated by one or more layers of connective tissue. Those in the outer skin layers (epidermis) and touch receptors wound around the base of hairs are naked dendrites. Touch receptors at the base of the stout whiskers of mammals such as cats and many rodents are extremely sensitive and enable the animal to detect nearby objects in the dark.

An example of an interoreceptor stimulated by mechanical distortion is the muscle spindle, or stretch receptor (see FIGURE 48.3). This mechanoreceptor monitors the length of skeletal muscles. The muscle spindle contains modified muscle fibers attached to sensory neurons and runs parallel to muscle. When the muscle is stretched, the fibers of the spindle are also stretched, depolarizing the sensory neurons and triggering action potentials that are transmitted back to the spinal cord.

The hair cell is a common type of mechanoreceptor that detects motion. Hair cells are found in the vertebrate ear and in the lateral line organs of fishes and amphibians, where they detect movement relative to the environment (see FIGURE 34.12a). The "hairs" are either specialized cilia or microvilli. They project upward from the surface of the hair cell into either an internal compartment, such as the human inner ear, or an external environment, such as a pond. When the cilia or microvilli bend in one direction, they stretch the hair cell membrane and increase its permeability to sodium and potassium ions, leading to an increase in the rate of impulse production in a sensory neuron. When the cilia bend in the opposite direction, ion permeability decreases, reducing the number of action potentials in the sensory neuron. This specificity allows hair cells to respond to the direction of motion as well as to its strength and speed (FIGURE 49.4).

Pain receptors in humans are a class of naked dendrites in the epidermis of the skin called nociceptors (see FIGURE 49.3). Most animals probably experience pain, although we cannot say what perceptions other animals actually associate with stimulation of their pain receptors. Pain is one of the most important sensations because the stimulus becomes translated into a defensive reaction, such as withdrawal from danger. Rare individuals who are born without any pain sensation may die from such conditions as a ruptured appendix because they cannot feel the associated pain and are unaware of the danger.

Different groups of pain receptors respond to excess heat, pressure, or specific classes of chemicals released from damaged or inflamed tissues. Some of the chemicals that trigger pain include histamine and acids. Prostaglandins increase pain by sensitizing the receptors--that is, lowering their threshold (see Chapter 45 to review prostaglandins). Aspirin and ibuprofen reduce pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

Thermoreceptors, responding to either heat or cold, help regulate body temperature by signaling both surface and body core temperature. There is still debate about the identity of thermoreceptors in the mammalian skin. Possible candidates are two receptors consisting of encapsulated, branched dendrites (see FIGURE 49.3). Many researchers, however, believe that these structures are actually modified pressure receptors and maintain that naked dendrites of certain sensory neurons are the actual thermoreceptors in the skin. There is general agreement that cold and heat receptors in the skin, as well as interothermoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus of the brain, send information to the body's thermostat, located in the posterior hypothalamus.

Chemoreceptors include both general receptors that transmit information about the total solute concentration in a solution and specific receptors that respond to individual kinds of molecules. Osmoreceptors in the mammalian brain, for example, are general receptors that detect changes in the total solute concentration of the blood and stimulate thirst when osmolarity increases (see Chapter 44). Water receptors in the feet of house flies respond to pure water or to a dilute solution of virtually any substance. Most animals also have receptors specific to important molecules, including glucose, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and amino acids. In all these examples, the stimulus molecule binds to a specific site on the membrane of the receptor cell and initiates changes in membrane permeability. Two other groups of chemoreceptors show intermediate specificity. Gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) receptors respond to categories of related chemicals. In taste, humans often classify such general categories as sweet, sour, salty, or bitter. Two of the most sensitive and specific chemoreceptors known are present in the antennae of the male silkworm moth (FIGURE 49.5). They detect the two chemical components of the female moth sex pheromone.

Electromagnetic receptors detect various forms of electromagnetic energy, such as visible light, electricity, and magnetism. Photoreceptors, which detect the radiation we know as visible light, are often organized into eyes. Snakes have extremely sensitive infrared receptors that detect the body heat of prey standing out against a colder background (FIGURE 49.6a). Some fishes discharge electric currents and use special electroreceptors to locate objects, such as prey, that disturb the electric currents. The platypus, a monotreme mammal, has electroreceptors on its bill that can probably detect electrical fields generated by the muscles of prey, such as crustaceans, frogs, and small fishes. There is also evidence that many animals that home or migrate use the magnetic field lines of Earth to help orient themselves (FIGURE 49.6b). The iron-containing mineral magnetite is found in the skulls of some birds and mammals (including humans), in the abdomens of bees, in the teeth of some mollusks, and in certain protists and prokaryotes that orient with respect to Earth's magnetic field. Once used by sailors as a primitive compass, magnetite may be part of an important orienting mechanism in many animals.

In the next few sections, we'll apply our overview of sensory receptors as we take a closer look at specific senses, such as sight and hearing.





 A diversity of photoreceptors has evolved among invertebrates

Most invertebrates have photoreceptors, which range from simple clusters of photoreceptor cells to complex image-forming eyes. One of the simplest is the eye cup of planarians, which provides information about light intensity and direction without actually forming an image. Photoreceptor cells are located within a cup formed by a layer of cells containing a screening pigment that blocks light. Light can enter the cup and stimulate the photoreceptors only through an opening on one side where there is no screening pigment (FIGURE 49.7). The opening of one eye cup faces left and slightly forward, and the opening of the other cup faces right-forward. Thus, light shining from one side of the planarian can enter only the eye cup on that side. The brain compares the rate of nerve impulses coming from the two eye cups, and the animal turns until the sensations from the two cups are equal and minimal. The result is that the animal moves directly away from the light source and reaches a shaded location beneath a rock or some other object, a behavioral adaptation that helps hide the planarian from predators.

Fig 49-7. Eye cups and orientation behavior of a planarian. The brain directs the body to turn until the sensations from the two cups are equal and minimal, causing the animal to move away from light.

Image-forming eyes of two major types have evolved in invertebrates: the compound eye and the single-lens eye. Compound eyes are found in insects and crustaceans (phylum Arthropoda) and some polychaete worms (phylum Annelida). A compound eye consists of up to several thousand light detectors called ommatidia (the "facets" of the eye), each with its own light-focusing lens (FIGURE 49.8). Each ommatidium registers light from a tiny portion of the visual field. Differences in the intensity of light entering the many ommatidia result in a mosaic image. The animal's brain may sharpen the image when it integrates the visual information. The compound eye is extremely acute at detecting movement, an important adaptation for flying insects and small animals constantly threatened with predation. For comparison, consider that the human eye can distinguish light flashes up to about 50 flashes per second. For this reason, the individual images of a movie, which flash at a faster rate, fuse together to create the perception of smooth motion. The compound eyes of some insects, however, recover from excitation rapidly enough to detect the flickering of a light flashing 330 times per second. Such an insect viewing a movie could easily resolve each frame of the film as a separate still image. Insects also have excellent color vision, and some (including bees) can see into the ultraviolet range of the spectrum, which is invisible to us. In studying animal behavior, we cannot extrapolate our sensory world to other species; different animals have different sensitivities and different brain organizations.

Fig 49-8. Compound eyes. (a) The faceted eyes on the head of a fly, photographed with a stereomicroscope. (b) The cornea and crystalline cone of each ommatidium function as a lens that focuses light onto the rhabdom, a stack of pigmented plates on the inside of a circle of receptor cells. The rhabdom traps light and guides it to the receptor cells. The image formed by a compound eye is a mosaic of dots formed by the different intensities of light entering the many ommatidia from different angles.

Among the invertebrates, single-lens eyes are found in some jellies, polychaetes, spiders, and many mollusks. A single-lens eye works on a cameralike principle. The eye of an octopus or squid, for example, has a small opening, the pupil, through which light enters. Analogous to a camera's adjustable aperature (F-stop), the iris of a single-lens eye changes the diameter of the pupil; behind the pupil, a single lens focuses light onto the retina, which consists of light-transducing receptor cells. Also similar to a camera's action, muscles move the lens forward or backward to focus images on the retina.





 Vertebrates have single-lens eyes

Similar to the single-lens eyes of many invertebrates, the eyes of vertebrates are also cameralike, but they evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage and differ from the single-lens eyes of invertebrates in several details. The human eye, shown in FIGURE 49.9, is capable of detecting an almost countless variety of colors, forming images of objects miles away, and responding to as little as one photon of light. Remember, however, that it is actually the brain that "sees." Thus, to understand vision we must begin by learning how the vertebrate eye generates sensations (action potentials), and then follow these signals to the visual centers of the brain, where images are perceived.

Fig 49-9. Structure of the vertebrate eye. In this longitudinal section of the eye, the jellylike vitreous humor is illustrated only in the lower half of the eyeball. The mucous membrane, or conjunctiva, surrounding the sclera (the white of the eye) is not shown.

The globe of the vertebrate eye, or eyeball, consists of a tough, white outer layer of connective tissue called the sclera and a thin, pigmented inner layer called the choroid. A delicate layer of epithelial cells forms a mucous membrane, the conjunctiva, that covers the outer surface of the sclera and helps keep the eye moist. At the front of the eye the sclera becomes the transparent cornea, which lets light into the eye and acts as a fixed lens. The conjunctiva does not cover the cornea. The anterior choroid forms the donut-shaped iris, which gives the eye its color. By changing size, the iris regulates the amount of light entering the pupil, the hole in the center of the iris. Just inside the choroid, the retina forms the innermost layer of the eyeball and contains the photoreceptor cells. Information from the photoreceptors leaves the eye at the optic disc, where the optic nerve attaches to the eye. Because there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc, this spot on the lower outside of the retina is a blind spot: Light focused onto that part of the retina is not detected.

The lens and ciliary body divide the eye into two cavities, one between the lens and the cornea, and a much larger cavity behind the lens within the eyeball itself. The ciliary body constantly produces the clear, watery aqueous humor that fills the anterior cavity of the eye. Blockage of the ducts that drain the aqueous humor can produce glaucoma, increased pressure that leads to blindness by compressing the retina. The posterior cavity, filled with the jellylike vitreous humor, constitutes most of the volume of the eye. The aqueous and vitreous humors function as liquid lenses that help focus light onto the retina. The lens itself is a transparent protein disc that focuses an image onto the retina. Like squid and octopuses, many fishes focus by moving the lens forward or backward, as in a camera. Humans and other mammals, however, focus by changing the shape of the lens. When viewing a distant object, the lens is flat. When focusing on a close object, the lens becomes almost spherical, a change called accommodation (FIGURE 49.10).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-10. Focusing in the mammalian eye. The lens bends light and focuses it onto the retina. The thicker the lens, the more sharply the light is bent. The lens is nearly spherical when focusing on near objects and much flatter when focusing on distant objects. Ciliary muscles control the shape of the lens. (a) In near vision, the ciliary muscles contract, pulling the border of the choroid layer of the eye toward the lens and causing the suspensory ligaments to relax. With this reduced tension, the elastic lens becomes thicker and rounder. This adjustment of the lens for close vision is known as accommodation. (b) In distance vision, the ciliary muscles relax, allowing the choroid to expand and put tension on the suspensory ligaments. The lens is pulled into a flatter shape.

The human retina contains about 125 million rod cells and 6 million cone cells, two types of photoreceptors named for their shapes. They account for 70%  of all sensory receptors in the body, a fact that underscores the importance of the eyes and visual information in how humans perceive their environment.

Rods and cones have different functions in vision, and the relative numbers of these two photoreceptors in the retina are partly correlated with whether an animal is most active during the day or at night. Rods are more sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors; they enable us to see at night, but only in black and white. Because it takes more light to stimulate cones, these receptors contribute very little to night vision. Cones can distinguish colors in daylight. Color vision is found in all vertebrate classes, though not in all species. Most fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds have strong color vision, but humans and other primates are among the minority of mammals with this ability. Most mammals are nocturnal, and a maximum number of rods in the retina is an adaptation that gives these animals keen night vision. Cats, usually most active at night, have limited color vision and probably see a pastel world during the day. In the human eye, rods are found in greatest density at the peripheral regions of the retina and are completely absent from the fovea, the center of the visual field (see FIGURE 49.9). You cannot see a dim star at night by looking at it directly; if you view it at an angle, however, focusing the starlight onto the regions of the retinas most populated by rods, you will be able to see the star. You achieve your sharpest daylight vision by looking straight at the object of interest because cones are most dense at the fovea, where there are about 150,000 color receptors per mm2. Some birds have more than a million cones per mm2, which enables such species as hawks to spot mice and other small prey from high in the sky. In the retina of the eye, as in all biological structures, variations represent evolutionary adaptations.





 The light-absorbing pigment rhodopsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway

When the vertebrate lens focuses a light image onto the retina, how do the cells of the retina transduce the stimuli into sensations--action potentials that transmit this information about the environment to the brain? Each rod cell or cone cell has an outer segment with a stack of folded membranes, or discs, in which visual pigments are embedded (FIGURE 49.11a, p. 1066). The visual pigments consist of a light-absorbing pigment molecule called retinal (a derivative of vitamin A) bonded to a membrane protein called an opsin. Opsins vary in structure from one type of photoreceptor to another, and the light-absorbing ability of retinal is affected by the specific identity of its opsin partner. Rods contain their own type of opsin, which, combined with retinal, makes up the visual pigment rhodopsin (FIGURE 49.11b).

Fig 49-11. Photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina. (a) Photoreceptors called rod cells (rods) are very sensitive to light and function in black-and-white vision at night; cone cells (cones) account for color vision during the day. Both rods and cones are modified neurons. Visual pigments are embedded in folded membranes comprising a stack of discs in the outer segment of each rod and cone. (b) Rhodopsin, the visual pigment in the disc membrane of rods, consists of the light-absorbing molecule retinal bonded to a specific type of membrane protein, an opsin. The opsin has seven regions of alpha helix that span the disc membrane.

When rhodopsin absorbs light, its retinal component changes shape and separates from opsin. This changes the conformation (shape) of the opsin protein. These light-induced changes in retinal plus opsin are referred to as "bleaching" of rhodopsin. In the dark, enzymes convert the retinal back to its original form, and it recombines with opsin to form rhodopsin (FIGURE 49.12, p. 1066). Bright light keeps the rhodopsin bleached and rods become unresponsive; cones take over. When you walk from a bright environment into a dark place, such as walking into a movie theater in the afternoon, you are initially almost blind to faint light. There is not enough light to stimulate the cones, and it takes at least a few minutes for the bleached rods to become functional again.

Fig 49-12. Effect of light on retinal. Retinal exists in two forms, isomers of each other. Absorption of light converts the pigment from the cis isomer to the trans isomer, which separates from the opsin. This retinal-free opsin triggers the signal-transduction pathway that converts the light signal into an electrochemical signal, a receptor potential, in the rod cell membrane. When the photoreceptor is no longer stimulated by light, enzymes convert the retinal back to the cis form, which recombines with opsin to form rhodopsin.

The light-induced shape-change by opsin triggers a signal-transduction pathway that ultimately results in a receptor potential in the rod cell membrane. First, the altered opsin activates a relay molecule in the signal-transduction pathway, a G protein called transducin, which is also in the disc membrane (FIGURE 49.13). In turn, transducin activates an enzyme that chemically alters the second messenger in the rod cell, a nucleotide called cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).

Fig 49-13. From light reception to receptor potential: A rod cell's signal-transduction pathway. Note that the receptor potential, in this case, is a hyperpolarization of the membrane rather than the more common depolarization.

In the dark, when rhodopsin is inactive, cGMP is bound to sodium ion channels in the rod cell plasma membrane and keeps those channels open. In this state, the rod cell membrane is actually depolarized and releases the neurotransmitter glutamate (see TABLE 48.1) at its synapses with neighboring cells called bipolar cells in the retina (FIGURE 49.14). This steady glutamate release in the dark excites some bipolar cells and inhibits others, depending on what post-synaptic receptor molecules they contain. When light triggers the rhodopsin signal-transduction pathway by altering retinal, an enzyme converts cGMP to GMP, which disengages from the Na+ channels (see FIGURE 49.13). This closes the channels, decreasing the membrane's permeability to Na+ and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. In this case, the cell's receptor potential is a hyperpolarization rather than a depolarization of the membrane. Hyperpolarization slows the rod cell's release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and this causes either excitation or inhibition of postsynaptic bipolar cells, depending on the bipolar cell's type of glutamate receptor (see FIGURE 49.14).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-14. The effect of light on synapses between rod cells and bipolar cells. (a) In the dark, rhodopsin is inactive, and the rod cell membrane is highly permeable to sodium and thus depolarized. In this state, the rod cell releases glutamate and regulates the "firing" of two different classes of bipolar cells, which have opposite responses to glutamate. (b) In contrast, when light activates rhodopsin, the rod cell membrane becomes less permeable to sodium, and its membrane potential changes (it develops a receptor potential, a hyperpolarization in this case). The synaptic terminals of the rod cell then slow their release of glutamate, enhancing the activity of one class of bipolar cells and suppressing the activity of the other type.

Color vision involves even more complex signal processing than the rhodopsin mechanism in rods. Color vision results from the presence of three subclasses of cones in the retina, each with its own type of opsin associated with retinal to form visual pigments collectively called photopsins. These photoreceptors are known as red cones, green cones, and blue cones, referring to the colors their kind of photopsin is best at absorbing. The absorption spectra for these pigments overlap, and the brain's perception of intermediate hues depends on the differential stimulation of two or more types of cones. For example, when both red and green cones are stimulated, we may see yellow or orange, depending on which of these two populations of cones is most strongly stimulated. Color blindness, more common in males than females because it is generally inherited as a sex-linked trait (see FIGURE 15.9), is due to a deficiency or absence of one or more types of photopsin.





 The retina assists the cerebral cortex in processing visual information

Processing of visual information begins in the retina itself. Note again that the axons of rods and cones synapse with neurons called bipolar cells, which in turn synapse with ganglion cells (FIGURE 49.15, p. 1068). Additional types of neurons in the retina, horizontal cells and amacrine cells, help integrate the information before it is sent to the brain. The axons of ganglion cells then convey the resulting sensations to the brain as action potentials along the optic nerve.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-15. The vertebrate retina. Light must pass through several relatively transparent layers of cells before reaching the rods and cones. These photoreceptors communicate with ganglion cells via bipolar cells. The axons of the ganglion cells transmit the visual sensations (action potentials) to the brain. There is not a one-to-one relationship among the rods and cones, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells; each bipolar cell receives information from several rods or cones, and each ganglion cell from several bipolar cells. The horizontal and amacrine cells carry information across the retina to integrate the signals. All the rods or cones that feed information to one ganglion cell form the receptive field for that cell. The larger the receptive field (the more rods or cones that supply a ganglion cell), the less sharp the image, because it is less evident exactly where the light struck the retina. The ganglion cells of the fovea have very small receptive fields, so visual acuity is very sharp in this area. Black arrows indicate the pathway of visual information (action potentials) from the retina to the optic nerve.

Signals from the rods and cones may follow either vertical or lateral pathways. In the so-called vertical pathway, information passes directly from the receptor cells to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. In the lateral pathway, the horizontal and amacrine cells provide lateral integration of visual signals. Horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptor cells and to several bipolar cells; amacrine cells spread the information from one bipolar cell to several ganglion cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant receptors and bipolar cells that are not illuminated, making the light spot appear lighter and the dark surroundings even darker. This integration, called lateral inhibition, sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the image. Lateral inhibition is repeated by the interactions of the amacrine cells with the ganglion cells and occurs at all levels of visual processing.

Axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerves that transmit sensations from the eyes to the brain. The optic nerves from the two eyes meet at the optic chiasm near the center of the base of the cerebral cortex (FIGURE 49.16). The nerve tracts of the optic chiasm are arranged in such a way that visual sensations from the left visual field of both eyes are transmitted to the right side of the brain, and visual sensations in the right visual field are transmitted to the left side of the brain. Most of the ganglion cell axons lead to the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus. Neurons of the lateral geniculate nuclei continue back to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the cerebrum. Additional interneurons carry the information to other, more sophisticated visual processing and integrating centers elsewhere in the cortex.

Fig 49-16. Neural pathways for vision. Because of the arrangement of neurons in the retinas, optic nerves, and optic chiasm, the right side of the brain receives sensory information about objects in the left visual field (blue), while the left side of the brain receives information from the right visual field (red). Each optic nerve contains about a million axons that synapse with interneurons in the lateral geniculate nuclei. The nuclei relay sensations to the visual cortex, believed to be the first of many brain centers that cooperate in constructing our visual perceptions.

Point-by-point information in the visual field is projected along neurons onto the visual cortex according to its position in the retina, but the information the brain receives is highly distorted. How does the brain convert a complex set of action potentials representing two-dimensional images projected onto our retinas into three-dimensional perceptions of our surroundings? Researchers estimate that at least 30%  of the cerebral cortex--hundreds of millions of interneurons in perhaps dozens of integrating centers--take part in formulating what we actually "see." Determining how these centers integrate such components of our vision as color, motion, depth, shape, and detail is the focus of an exciting, fast-moving research effort.





 The mammalian hearing organ is within the inner ear

The mammalian ear can be divided into three regions. The outer ear consists of the external pinna and the auditory canal, which collect sound waves and channel them to the tympanic membrane (eardrum) separating the outer ear from the middle ear. Within the middle ear, vibrations are conducted through three ossicles (small bones)--the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup)--to the inner ear, passing through the oval window, a membrane beneath the stapes (FIGURE 49.17a and b, p. 1070). The middle ear also opens into the Eustachian tube, which connects with the pharynx and equalizes pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere, enabling you to "pop" your ears when changing altitude, for example. The inner ear consists of a labyrinth of channels within a skull bone (the temporal bone). These channels are lined by a membrane and contain fluid that moves in response to sound or movement of the head.

Fig 49-17. Structure and function of the human ear.

The part of the inner ear involved in hearing is a coiled organ known as the cochlea (Latin, "snail"). The cochlea has two large chambers, an upper vestibular canal and a lower tympanic canal, separated by a smaller cochlear duct (FIGURE 49.17c). The vestibular and tympanic canals contain a fluid called perilymph, and the cochlear duct is filled with a liquid called endolymph. The floor of the cochlear duct, the basilar membrane, bears the organ of Corti, which contains the actual receptor cells of the ear, hair cells with hairs projecting into the cochlear duct (FIGURE 49.17d). Many of the hairs are attached to the tectorial membrane, which hangs over the organ of Corti like a shelf.

How is the anatomy of the ear correlated with the function of hearing? The ear converts the energy of pressure waves traveling through air into nerve impulses that the brain perceives as sound. Vibrating objects, such as the reverberating strings of a guitar or the vocal cords of a speaking person, create percussion waves in the surrounding air. These waves cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate with the same frequency as the sound. The three bones of the middle ear transmit the mechanical movements to the oval window, a membrane on the surface of the cochlea. Vibrations of the oval window produce pressure waves in the fluid within the cochlea.

The cochlea transduces the energy of the vibrating fluid into action potentials. The stapes vibrating against the oval window creates a traveling pressure wave in the fluid of the cochlea that passes into the vestibular canal (FIGURE 49.18a, p. 1071). This wave continues around the tip of the cochlea and through the tympanic canal, dissipating as it strikes the round window. The pressure waves in the vestibular canal push downward on the cochlear duct and basilar membrane. The basilar membrane vibrates up and down in response to the pressure waves, and its hair cells alternately brush against and are withdrawn from the tectorial membrane. Deflection of the hairs opens ion channels in the plasma membrane of the hair cells, and positive ions (K+, in this case) enter. The resulting depolarization increases neurotransmitter release from the hair cell and the frequency of action potentials in the sensory neuron with which the hair cell synapses. This neuron carries the sensations to the brain through the auditory nerve.

Fig 49-18. How the cochlea distinguishes pitch. (a) Vibrations of the stapes against the oval window agitate the fluid within the cochlea (uncoiled here), causing pressure waves having a frequency equivalent to the sound waves that entered the ear. The waves (black arrows) pass through the vestibular canal to the apex of the conchlea then back toward the base of the cochlea via the tympanic canal. The energy causes the cochlear duct, with its basilar membrane and organ of Corti, to vibrate up and down. The bouncing of the basilar membrane stimulates the hair cells within the cochlear duct. (b) Fibers span the width of the basilar membrane. Like harp strings, these fibers vary in length, being shorter near the base of the membrane and longer near its apex. The length of the fibers "tunes" specific regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate at specific frequencies. (c) Different frequencies of pressure waves in the cochlea cause certain places along the basilar membrane to vibrate, stimulating particular hair cells and sensory neurons. The differential stimulation of hair cells is perceived in the brain as sound of a certain pitch.

Sound is detected by increases in the frequency of impulses in the sensory neuron, but how is the quality of that sound determined? Two important sound variables are volume and pitch. Volume (loudness) is determined by the amplitude, or height, of the sound wave. The greater the amplitude of a sound, the more vigorous the vibrations of fluid in the cochlea, the greater the bending of the hair cells, and the more action potentials generated in the sensory neurons. Pitch is a function of a sound wave's frequency, or number of vibrations per second, expressed in hertz (Hz). Short, high-frequency waves produce high-pitched sound, while long, low-frequency waves generate low-pitched sound. Healthy young humans can hear sounds in the range of 20 to 20,000 Hz, dogs can hear sounds as high as 40,000 Hz, and bats can emit and hear clicking sounds of even higher frequency, using this ability to locate objects by sonar.

Pitch can be distinguished by the cochlea because the basilar membrane is not uniform along its length (see FIGURE 49.18b and c). The proximal end near the oval window is relatively narrow and stiff, while the distal end near the tip is wider and more flexible. Each region of the basilar membrane is most affected by a particular vibration frequency. The sensory neurons associated with the region vibrating most vigorously at any instant send the most action potentials along the auditory nerve. But the actual perception of pitch depends on neural mapping of the brain. Sensory neurons from the auditory pathway project onto specific auditory areas of the cerebral cortex according to the region of the basilar membrane in which the signal originated. When a particular site of the cortex is stimulated, we perceive a sound of a particular pitch.





 The inner ear also contains the organs of equilibrium

Several organs in the inner ear of humans and most other mammals detect body position and balance. Behind the oval window is a vestibule that contains two chambers, the utricle and saccule. The utricle opens into three semicircular canals that complete the apparatus for equilibrium (FIGURE 49.19a).

Fig 49-19. Organs of balance in the inner ear. (a) Three structures of the inner ear--the utricle and saccule in the vestibule and the semicircular canals--contain hair cells sensitive to balance and body position. The saccule and utricle tell the brain which way is up and also inform it of the body's fixed position in space or of any linear acceleration associated with movement. The semicircular canals are arranged in the three spatial planes. (b) Each canal has at its base a swelling called an ampulla, which contains a cluster of hair cells with hairs projecting into a gelatinous cap called the cupula. (c) When the head changes its rate of rotation, inertia prevents the endolymph in the semicircular canals from moving with the head, so the fluid presses against the cupula, bending the hair cells. The bending increases the frequency of action potentials in the sensory neurons in direct proportion to the amount of rotational acceleration. The mechanism adjusts quickly if rotation continues at a constant speed: The endolymph begins moving with the head, and the pressure on the cupula is reduced. If rotation stops suddenly, however, the fluid continues to flow through the semicircular canals and again stimulates the hair cells. This new stimulus can cause dizziness.

Sensations related to body position are generated much like sensations of sound in humans and most other mammals. Hair cells in the utricle and saccule respond to changes in head position with respect to gravity and movement in one direction. The hair cells are arranged in clusters, and all the hairs project into a gelatinous material containing many small calcium carbonate particles called otoliths ("ear stones"). Because this material is heavier than the endolymph within the utricle and saccule, gravity is always pulling downward on the hairs of the receptor cells, sending a constant series of action potentials along the sensory neurons of the vestibular branch of the auditory nerve.

Different body angles cause different hair cells and their sensory neurons to be stimulated. When the position of the head changes with respect to gravity (as when the head bends forward), the force on the hair cell changes, and it increases (or decreases--see FIGURE 49.4) its output of neurotransmitter. The brain interprets the resulting changes in impulse production by the sensory neurons to determine the position of the head. By a similar mechanism, the semicircular canals, arranged in the three spatial planes, detect changes in the rate of rotation or angular movements of the head (FIGURE 49.19b and c).





 A lateral line system and inner ear detect pressure waves in most fishes and aquatic amphibians

Like other vertebrates, fishes and aquatic amphibians also have inner ears located near the brain. There is no cochlea, but there are a saccule, a utricle, and semicircular canals, structures homologous to the equilibrium sensors of our own ears. Within these chambers in the inner ear of a fish, sensory hairs are stimulated by the movement of otoliths. Unlike the mammalian hearing apparatus, the ear of a fish has no eardrum and does not open to the outside of the body. Vibrations of the water caused by sound waves are conducted through the skeleton of the head to the inner ears, setting the otoliths in motion and stimulating the hair cells. The air-filled swim bladder (see Chapter 34) also vibrates in response to sound and may contribute to the transfer of sound to the inner ear. Some fishes, including catfishes and minnows, have a series of bones called the Weberian apparatus, which conducts vibrations from the swim bladder to the inner ear.

Most fishes and aquatic amphibians also have a lateral line system along both sides of the body (FIGURE 49.20). The system contains mechanoreceptors that detect low-frequency waves by a mechanism similar to the function of the inner ear. Water from the animal's surroundings enters the lateral line system through numerous pores and flows along a tube past the mechanoreceptors. The receptor units, called neuromasts, resemble the ampullae in our semicircular canals. Each neuromast has a cluster of hair cells, with the sensory hairs embedded in a gelatinous cap, the cupula. As the pressure of moving water bends a cupula, the hair cells transduce the energy into receptor potentials and then into action potentials that are transmitted along a nerve to the brain. This information helps the fish perceive its movement through water or the direction and velocity of water currents flowing over its body. The lateral line system also detects water movements or vibrations generated by other moving objects, including prey and predators.

Fig 49-20. The lateral line system in a fish. Water flowing through the system bends hair cells. The hair cells transduce the energy into receptor potentials, triggering action potentials, which are conveyed to the brain. The lateral line system enables a fish to monitor water currents, pressure waves produced by moving objects, and low-frequency sounds conducted through water.

The lateral line system functions only in water. In terrestrial vertebrates, the inner ear has evolved as the main organ of hearing and equilibrium. Some amphibians have a lateral line system as tadpoles, but not as adults living on land. In the ear of a terrestrial frog or toad, sound vibrations traveling in the air are conducted to the inner ear by a tympanic membrane on the body surface and a single middle ear bone. There also is evidence that the lungs of a frog vibrate in response to sound and transmit their vibrations to the eardrum via the auditory tube. A small side pocket of the saccule functions as the main hearing organ of the frog, and it is this outgrowth of the saccule that gave rise to the more elaborate cochlea during the evolution of mammals. Birds also have a cochlea, but like amphibians and reptiles, sound is conducted from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear by a single bone, the stapes.





 Many invertebrates have gravity sensors and are sound-sensitive

Most invertebrates have sensory organs called statocysts that contain mechanoreceptors and function in their sense of equilibrium (FIGURE 49.21). A common type of statocyst has a layer of hair cells surrounding a chamber containing statoliths, which are grains of sand or other dense granules. Gravity causes the statoliths to settle to the low point within the chamber, stimulating hair cells in that location. This is similar to how the saccule and utricle function in vertebrates, and indeed these structures in the vertebrate inner ear are considered to be specialized types of statocysts. The statocysts of invertebrates have various locations. For example, many jellies have statocysts at the fringe of the "bell," giving the animals an indication of body position. Lobsters and crayfish have statocysts near the bases of their antennules. Crayfish have been tricked into swimming upside down in experiments in which the statoliths were replaced with metal shavings that could be pulled to the upper end of the statocysts with magnets.

Fig 49-21. The statocyst of an invertebrate. The settling of statoliths to the low point within the chamber bends cilia on receptor cells in that location, providing the brain with information about the position of the body.

Many invertebrates demonstrate a general sensitivity to sound, although structures specialized for hearing seem to be less widespread than gravity sensors. Hearing structures have been most extensively studied in terrestrial insects.

Many (perhaps most) insects have body hairs that vibrate in response to sound waves. Hairs of different stiffness and length vibrate at different frequencies. The hairs are commonly tuned to frequencies of sounds produced by other organisms. A male mosquito locates a mate by means of fine hairs on his antennae. The hairs vibrate in a specific way in response to the hum produced by the beating wings of flying females. A tuning fork that vibrates at the same frequency as a female mosquito's wings will also attract males. Some caterpillars (larval moths and butterflies) have vibrating body hairs that detect the buzzing wings of predatory wasps, warning the caterpillars of danger. Many insects also have localized "ears" (FIGURE 49.22). A tympanic membrane (eardrum) is stretched over an internal air chamber. Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane, stimulating receptor cells attached to the inside of the membrane and resulting in nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain. Some moths can hear notes of such high pitch that they detect the sounds bats produce for sonar, and perception of these sounds triggers the moth's escape maneuver, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.

 Perceptions of taste and smell are usually interrelated

The perceptions of taste and smell both depend on chemoreceptors that detect specific chemicals in the environment. In the case of terrestrial animals, taste is the detection of certain chemicals that are present in a solution, and smell is the detection of airborne chemicals. However, these chemical senses are usually closely related, and there really is no distinction in aquatic environments.

The taste receptors of insects are located within sensory hairs called sensillae on the feet and mouthparts. The animals use their sense of taste to select food. A tasting hair contains several chemoreceptor cells, each especially responsive to a particular class of chemical stimuli, such as sugar or salt. By integrating sensations (nerve impulses) from these different receptor cells, the insect's brain can apparently distinguish a very large number of tastes (FIGURE 49.23). Insects can also smell airborne chemicals, using olfactory sensillae, usually located on the antennae (see FIGURE 49.5).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-23. The mechanism of taste in a blowfly. (a) Gustatory sensillae (hairs) on the feet and mouthparts each contain four chemoreceptor cells with dendrites that extend to the pore at the tip of the sensory hair. (b) Each chemoreceptor (taste) cell is especially sensitive to a particular class of substance; for example, the receptor colored green here is most responsive to sugars. But this specificity is relative; each cell can respond to some extent to a broad range of chemical stimuli. Thus, any natural food probably stimulates two or more of the receptor cells. The brain apparently integrates the frequencies of impulses arriving along the axons of the four classes of receptor cells and distinguishes a great variety of tastes.

In humans and other mammals, the senses of taste and smell are functionally similar and interrelated. In both cases a small molecule must dissolve in liquid to reach the receptor cell and trigger the sensation. That molecule binds to a specific protein in the receptor cell membrane, triggering a depolarization of the membrane and the release of neurotransmitter (see FIGURE 49.2).

The receptor cells for taste are modified epithelial cells organized into taste buds scattered in several areas of the tongue and mouth. Most of the taste buds are on the surface of the tongue or are associated with nipplelike projections called papillae on the tongue. Although we cannot distinguish different types of taste receptors from their structures, we recognize four basic taste perceptions--sweet, sour, salty, and bitter--each detected by a chemoreceptor with a certain receptor and signal-transduction pathway. Although each receptor cell is more responsive to a particular type of substance, it can actually be stimulated by a broad range of chemicals. With each taste of food or sip of drink, the brain integrates the differential input from the taste buds, and a complex flavor is perceived.

The olfactory sense of mammals detects certain airborne chemicals. Olfactory receptor cells are neurons that line the upper portion of the nasal cavity and send impulses along their axons directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain (FIGURE 49.24). The receptive ends of the cells contain cilia that extend into the layer of mucus coating the nasal cavity. When an odorous substance diffuses into this region, it binds to specific receptor molecules on the plasma membrane of the olfactory cilia. The binding triggers a signal-transduction pathway involving a G-protein-signaling pathway and, in many cases, the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and the second messenger cyclic AMP (see FIGURE 11.13). The second messenger opens Na+ channels in the olfactory receptor cell membrane, depolarizing it and generating action potentials that go to the brain. Humans can distinguish thousands of different odors, but these are probably based on a few primary odors, analogous to the basic tastes of the gustatory system.

Fig 49-24. Olfaction in humans. The specific binding of molecules (blue dots) to specific receptor molecules in the plasma membrane of chemoreceptor cells triggers action potentials. Action potentials are conveyed to neurons in the olfactory bulb of the brain by axons of the receptor cells.

Although the receptors and brain pathways for taste and olfaction are independent, the two senses do interact. Indeed, much of what we call taste is really smell. If the olfactory system is blocked, as by a head cold, the perception of taste is sharply reduced.

Throughout our discussions of sensory mechanisms we have seen many examples of how sensory inputs to the nervous system result in the specific body movements that we observe as animal behavior. The swimming of planarians away from light, the escape behavior of a moth that hears bat sonar, the "righting" response of a crayfish turned upside-down, and the feeding movements of a hydra when it tastes glutathione--these are just a few cases that we have mentioned so far. Animal behavior flows in a seamless cycle involving continuous brain operations that generate actions, note the consequences of these actions via sensory mechanisms, and then use this information to decide on the next action. The remainder of the chapter focuses on the motor mechanisms that make these animal responses possible: how animals use their muscles and skeletons to move.





 Locomotion requires energy to overcome friction and gravity

The modes of animal locomotion are diverse. Most animal phyla include species that swim. On land and in the sediments on the floor of the sea and lakes, animals crawl, walk, run, or hop. Active flight (in contrast to gliding downward from a tree or elevated ground) has evolved in only a few animal groups: insects, reptiles, birds, and, among the mammals, bats. A large group of flying reptiles died out millions of years ago, leaving birds and bats as the only flying vertebrates.

In all its forms, locomotion requires that an animal expend energy to overcome two forces that tend to keep it stationary: friction and gravity. Exerting force requires energy-consuming cellular work. Thus, the study of locomotion returns us to the theme of animal bioenergetics. The energetic cost of transport is different for the various modes of locomotion in different environments. FIGURE 49.25 compares these costs for swimming, running, and flying. Running animals generally consume more energy per meter traveled than equivalently sized animals specialized for swimming, partly because to run (or walk), an animal must expend energy to overcome gravity. Swimming is the most efficient mode of transport (assuming, of course, that an animal is specialized for swimming). If we were to compare energy consumption per minute rather than per meter, we would find that flying animals use more energy than animals swimming or walking for the same amount of time. Each line on the graph in FIGURE 49.25 also shows that a larger animal travels more efficiently than a smaller species specialized for the same mode of transport. For example, a horse consumes less energy per kilogram of body weight than a cat running the same distance. (Of course, total energy consumption is greater for the larger animal.)

Fig 49-25. The cost of transport. This graph compares the transport cost, in joules per kilogram of body weight per meter traveled, for animals specialized for swimming, flying, and running (1 J = 0.24 cal). Notice that both axes are plotted on logarithmic scales.

Swimming

Because most animals are reasonably buoyant in water, overcoming gravity is less of a problem for swimming animals than for species that move on land or through the air. On the other hand, water is a much denser medium than air, and thus the problem of resistance (friction) is a major one for aquatic animals. A sleek, fusiform (torpedolike) shape is a common adaptation of fast swimmers (see FIGURE 40.6), and swimming tends to be the most energy-efficient means of locomotion.

Animals swim in diverse ways. For instance, many insects and four-legged vertebrates use their legs as oars to push against the water. Squid, scallops, and some cnidarians are jet-propelled, taking in water and squirting it out in bursts. Fishes swim by moving their body and tail from side to side. Whales and other aquatic mammals move by undulating their body and tail up and down.

Locomotion on Land

In general, the problems of locomotion on land are the opposite of those in water. On land, a walking, running, hopping, or crawling animal must be able to support itself and move against gravity, but, at least at moderate speeds, air poses relatively little resistance. When a land animal walks, runs, or hops, its leg muscles expend energy both to propel it and to keep it from falling down. With each step, the animal's leg muscles must also overcome inertia by accelerating a leg from a standing start. For moving on land, powerful muscles and strong skeletal support are more important than a streamlined shape.

Diverse adaptations for traveling on land have evolved in various vertebrates. For example, traveling mainly by hopping, kangaroos have large muscles that generate a lot of power in their hind legs (FIGURE 49.26). When a kangaroo lands, tendons in its hind legs momentarily store energy. The higher the animal hops, the more energy the tendons store. Analogous to the tension of a spring on a pogo stick, the stored energy is available for the next jump and is a cost-free energy boost that reduces the total amount of energy the animal must expend to travel. The pogo stick analogy applies to many land animals; the legs of an insect, a dog, or a human, for instance, retain some spring when walking or running, although considerably less than those of a hopping kangaroo.

Fig 49-26. Energy-efficient locomotion on land. Members of the kangaroo family travel from place to place mainly by leaping forward on their large hind legs. Kinetic energy momentarily stored in tendons after each leap provides a cost-free boost for the next leap. In fact, a large kangaroo hopping along at 30 km/h uses no more energy per minute than it does at 6 km/h. The large tail helps balance the animal's body during leaps and while sitting on the ground.

Maintaining balance is another prerequisite for walking, running, or hopping. A kangaroo's large tail helps balance its body during leaps and also forms a stable tripod with its hind legs when sitting or moving slowly. Illustrating the same principle, a walking cat, dog, or horse keeps three feet on the ground. Bipedal animals, such as humans and birds, keep part of at least one foot on the ground when walking. When running, all four feet (or both feet for bipeds) may be off the ground momentarily, but at running speeds, it is momentum more than foot contact that keeps the body upright.

Crawling poses a very different situation. Because much of its body is in contact with the ground, a crawling animal must exert considerable effort to overcome friction. Earthworms crawl by peristalsis, a type of locomotion dependent on a hydrostatic skeleton, which we examine later. Many snakes crawl by undulating the entire body from side to side. Assisted by large, movable scales on the underside, a snake's body pushes against the ground, driving the animal forward. Boa constrictors and pythons creep straight forward, driven by muscles that lift their belly scales off the ground, tilt the scales forward, and then push them backward against the ground.

Flying

Gravity poses a major problem for a flying animal. For an animal to become airborne, its wings must develop enough lift to overcome the downward force of gravity. The key to flight is the shape of the wings. All types of wings, including those of airplanes, are airfoils--structures whose shape alters air currents in a way that creates lift (see FIGURE 34.26).

Cellular and Skeletal Underpinnings of Locomotion

Underlying the diverse forms of locomotion are fundamental mechanisms common to all animals. At the cellular level, all animal movement is based on one of two basic contractile systems, both of which consume energy to move protein strands against one another. These two systems of cell motility--microtubules and microfilaments--were discussed in Chapter 7. Microtubules are responsible for the beating of cilia and the undulations of flagella. Microfilaments play a major role in amoeboid movement, and they are also the contractile elements of muscle cells. It is the contraction of muscles that concerns us in this chapter, but the work of a muscle in itself cannot translate into movement of the animal. Swimming, crawling, running, hopping, and flying all result from muscles working against some type of skeleton.





 Skeletons support and protect the animal body and are essential to movement

The three functions of a skeleton are support, protection, and movement. Most land animals would sag from their own weight if they had no skeleton to support them. Even an animal living in water would be a formless mass with no framework to maintain its shape. Many animals have hard skeletons that protect soft tissues. For example, the vertebrate skull protects the brain, and the ribs form a cage around the heart, lungs, and other internal organs. And skeletons aid in movement by giving muscles something firm to work against. There are three main types of skeletons: hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons.

Hydrostatic Skeletons

A hydrostatic skeleton consists of fluid held under pressure in a closed body compartment. This is the main type of skeleton in most cnidarians, flatworms, nematodes, and annelids (see Chapter 33). These animals control their form and movement by using muscles to change the shape of the fluid-filled compartments. Among the cnidarians, for example, a hydra can elongate by closing its mouth and using contractile cells in the body wall to constrict the central gastrovascular cavity. Because water cannot be compressed very much, decreasing the diameter of the cavity forces it to increase in length. In flatworms (planarians), the interstitial fluid is kept under pressure and functions as the main hydrostatic skeleton. Planarian movement results mainly from muscles in the body wall exerting localized forces against the hydrostatic skeleton. Roundworms (nematodes) hold the fluid in the body cavity (a pseudocoelom; see FIGURE 32.6b) at a high pressure, and contractions of longitudinal muscles result in thrashing movements. In earthworms and other annelids, the coelomic fluid functions as a hydrostatic skeleton. The coelomic cavity is divided by septa between the segments of the worm, and thus the animal can change the shape of each segment individually, using both circular and longitudinal muscles. The hydrostatic skeleton enables earthworms and most other annelids to move by peristalsis, a type of locomotion produced by rhythmic waves of muscle contractions passing from head to tail (FIGURE 49.27, p. 1078).

Hydrostatic skeletons are well suited for life in aquatic environments. They may cushion internal organs from shocks and provide support for crawling and burrowing. However, a hydrostatic skeleton cannot support the forms of terrestrial locomotion in which an animal's body is held off the ground, such as walking or running.

Exoskeletons

An exoskeleton is a hard encasement deposited on the surface of an animal. For example, most mollusks are enclosed in calcareous (calcium carbonate) shells secreted by the mantle, a sheetlike extension of the body wall (see FIGURE 33.16). As the animal grows, it enlarges the diameter of the shell by adding to its outer edge. Clams and other bivalves close their hinged shells using muscles attached to the inside of this exoskeleton.

The jointed exoskeleton typical of arthropods is a cuticle, a nonliving coat secreted by the epidermis. Muscles are attached to knobs and plates of the cuticle that extend into the interior of the body. About 30-50%  of the cuticle consists of chitin, a polysaccharide similar to cellulose. Fibrils of chitin are embedded in a matrix made of protein, forming a composite material that combines strength and flexibility. Where protection is most important, the cuticle is hardened with organic compounds that cross-link the proteins of the exoskeleton. Some crustaceans, such as lobsters, harden portions of their exoskeletons even more by adding calcium salts. In contrast, at the joints of the legs, where the cuticle must be thin and flexible, there is only a small amount of inorganic salts and little cross-linking of proteins. The exoskeleton of an arthropod must periodically be shed (molted) and replaced by a larger case with each spurt of growth by the animal (see FIGURE 5.9).

Endoskeletons

An endoskeleton consists of hard supporting elements, such as bones, buried within the soft tissues of an animal. Sponges are reinforced by hard spicules consisting of inorganic material or by softer fibers made of protein (see FIGURE 33.3). Echinoderms have an endoskeleton of hard plates beneath the skin. These ossicles are composed of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate crystals, and the separate plates are usually bound together by protein fibers. Sea urchins have a skeleton of tightly bound ossicles, but the ossicles of sea stars are more loosely bound, allowing the animal to change the shape of its arms (see FIGURE 33.38).

Chordates have endoskeletons consisting of cartilage, bone, or some combination of these materials (see FIGURE 40.2). The mammalian skeleton is built from more than 200 bones, some fused together and others connected at joints by ligaments that allow freedom of movement (FIGURE 49.28). Anatomists divide the vertebrate frame into an axial skeleton, consisting of the skull, vertebral column (backbone), and rib cage, and an appendicular skeleton, made up of limb bones and the pectoral and pelvic girdles that anchor the appendages to the axial skeleton. In each appendage, several types of joints provide flexibility for body movement and locomotion.

(b) Joints allow great flexibility in body movement, indicated by arrows. Hinge and pivot joints between bones in our wrists and hands enable us to make precise manipulations.





 Physical support on land depends on adaptations of body proportions and posture

An engineer designing a bridge or tall building must take into account the effects of changes in size, or scale. An increase in size from a small-scale model to the real thing has a significant effect on building design. Physical laws dictate that the strength of a building support depends on its cross-sectional area, which increases as the square of its diameter. In sharp contrast, the strain on the supports depends on the building's weight, which increases as the cube of its height or other linear dimension. In common with a bridge or a building, an animal's body "design" must account for the greater demand for support that comes with increasing size. Consistent with physical laws, a large animal, such as an elephant, has very different body proportions than a small animal, such as a mouse. Imagine a mouse, with its very slender legs, scaled up to elephant size. If the imaginary animal kept its mouselike body proportions, its legs would buckle under its weight.

In simply applying the building analogy, we might predict the size of an elephant's leg bones to be directly proportional to the strain imposed by its body weight. However, our prediction would be inaccurate; an animal's body is complex and nonrigid, and the building analogy only partly explains the relationship between animal body design and support. The size of an animal's legs relative to its body size is only part of the story. It turns out that body posture--the position of the legs relative to the main body--is a more important structural feature in supporting body weight, at least in mammals and birds (FIGURE 49.29). Muscles and tendons (connective tissue joining muscles to bones), which hold the legs of elephants, coyotes, humans, and other large mammals relatively straight and under the body, bear most of the load.

Fig 49-29. Posture helps support large land vertebrates. A coyote stands, walks, and runs with most of its weight supported by muscles and tendons, which hold its legs directly under the body.





 Muscles move skeletal parts by contracting

As we mentioned earlier, animal movement is based on the contraction of muscles working against some type of skeleton. The action of a muscle is always to contract; muscles can extend only passively.

The ability to move parts of the body in opposite directions requires that muscles be attached to the skeleton in antagonistic pairs, each muscle working against the other (FIGURE 49.30). We flex our arm, for instance, by contracting the biceps, with the hinged joint of the elbow acting as the fulcrum of a lever. To extend the arm, we relax the biceps while the triceps on the opposite side contracts. But how does a muscle actually contract? As always, the key to function is structure. In this section we will examine the structure and mechanism of contraction of vertebrate skeletal muscle and then compare this basic pattern with other types of muscle.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-30. The cooperation of muscles and skeletons in movement. Muscles actively contract, but they elongate only when passively stretched. Back-and-forth movement is generally accomplished by antagonistic muscles, each working against the other. This arrangement works with either an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. (a) In humans, contraction of the biceps muscle, represented by red in the bottom diagram, raises (flexes) the forearm. Contraction of the triceps muscle (green) lowers (extends) the forearm. (b) Although arthropod muscles are positioned differently and housed within an exoskeleton, the antagonistic action of flexors and extensors is similar to that of a vertebrate. When the flexor muscle (red) in the upper part of a grasshopper's leg contracts, the lower leg is pulled toward the body. In this position the grasshopper is sitting, poised for a jump, as shown here. Alternatively, when the extensor muscle (green) in its upper leg contracts, the leg jerks backward, sending the insect into the air.

Structure and Function of Vertebrate Skeletal Muscle

Vertebrate skeletal muscle, which is attached to the bones and is responsible for their movement, is characterized by a hierarchy of smaller and smaller parallel units (FIGURE 49.31). A skeletal muscle consists of a bundle of long fibers running the length of the muscle. Each fiber is a single cell with many nuclei, reflecting its formation by the fusion of many embryonic cells. Each fiber is itself a bundle of smaller myofibrils arranged longitudinally. The myofibrils, in turn, are composed of two kinds of myofilaments. Thin filaments consist of two strands of actin and one strand of regulatory protein coiled around one another, while thick filaments are staggered arrays of myosin molecules.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 49-31. The structure of skeletal muscle.

Skeletal muscle is also called striated muscle because the regular arrangement of the myofilaments creates a repeating pattern of light and dark bands. Each repeating unit is a sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of the muscle. The borders of the sarcomere, the Z lines, are lined up in adjacent myofibrils and contribute to the striations visible with a light microscope. The thin filaments are attached to the Z lines and project toward the center of the sarcomere, while the thick filaments are centered in the sarcomere. At rest, the thick and thin filaments do not overlap completely, and the area near the edge of the sarcomere where there are only thin filaments is called the I band. The A band is the broad region that corresponds to the length of the thick filaments. The thin filaments do not extend completely across the sarcomere, so the H zone in the center of the A band contains only thick filaments. This arrangement of thick and thin filaments is the key to how the sarcomere, and hence the whole muscle, contracts.





 Interactions between myosin and actin generate force during muscle contractions

When a muscle contracts, the length of each sarcomere is reduced; that is, the distance from one Z line to the next becomes shorter. In the contracted sarcomere, the A bands do not change in length, but the I bands shorten and the H zone disappears (FIGURE 49.32). These changes can be explained by the sliding-filament model of muscle contraction. According to this model, neither the thin filaments nor the thick filaments change in length when the muscle contracts; rather, the filaments slide past each other longitudinally, so that the degree of overlap of the thin and thick filaments increases. If the region of overlap increases, both the length occupied only by thin filaments (the I band) and the length occupied only by thick filaments (the H zone) must decrease.

As seen in these transmission electron micrographs, the lengths of the thick (myosin) filaments (purple) and thin (actin) filaments (orange) remain the same as contraction occurs. (a) In a relaxed muscle, the length of each sarcomere is greater than in a contracting or contracted muscle. (b) During contraction, thick and thin filaments slide past each other, shortening the sarcomere. (c) When the muscle is fully contracted, the sarcomere is markedly shortened; the thin filaments overlap, and there is little or no space between the ends of the thick filaments and the Z lines.

The sliding of the filaments is based on the interaction of the actin and myosin molecules that make up the thin and thick filaments. Myosin consists of a long, fibrous "tail" region, with a globular "head" region sticking off to the side. The tail is where the individual myosin molecules cohere to form the thick filament. The myosin head is the center of bioenergetic reactions that power muscle contractions. It can bind ATP and hydrolyze it into ADP and inorganic phosphate. Some of the energy released by cleaving the ATP is transferred to the myosin, which changes shape to a high-energy configuration (FIGURE 49.33). This energized myosin binds to a specific site on actin, forming a cross-bridge. The stored energy is released, and the myosin head relaxes to its low-energy configuration. This relaxation changes the angle of attachment of the myosin head to the myosin tail. According to this hypothesis, as the myosin bends inward on itself, it exerts tension on the thin filament to which it is bound, pulling the thin filament toward the center of the sarcomere. The bond between the low-energy myosin and actin is broken when a new molecule of ATP binds to the myosin head. In a repeating cycle, the free head can then cleave the new ATP to revert to the high-energy configuration and attach to a new binding site on another actin molecule farther along the thin filament. Each of the approximately 350 heads of a thick filament forms and re-forms about five cross-bridges per second, driving filaments past each other.

Fig 49-33. One hypothesis for how myosin-actin interactions generate the force for muscle contraction.

A muscle cell typically stores only enough ATP for a few contractions. Muscle cells also store glycogen between the myofibrils, but most of the energy needed for repetitive muscle contraction is stored in substances called phosphagens. Creatine phosphate, the phosphagen of vertebrates, can supply a phosphate group to ADP to make ATP.





 Calcium ions and regulatory proteins control muscle contraction

A skeletal muscle contracts only when stimulated by a motor neuron. When the muscle is at rest, the myosin binding sites on the actin molecules are blocked by the regulatory protein tropomyosin. Another set of regulatory proteins, the troponin complex, controls the position of tropomyosin on the thin filament (FIGURE 49.34). For a muscle cell to contract, the myosin binding sites on the actin must be uncovered. This occurs when calcium ions bind to troponin, altering the interaction between troponin and tropomyosin. The Ca2+ binding rearranges the tropomyosin-troponin complex, exposing the myosin binding sites on actin. When calcium is present, the sliding of thin and thick filaments can occur, and the muscle contracts. When calcium concentration in the cytosol falls, the binding sites of actin are covered, and contraction stops.

Fig 49-34. Hypothetical mechanism for the control of muscle contraction. The thin filament has two strands of actin twisted into a helix. (a) When the muscle is at rest, a long, rodlike tropomyosin molecule blocks the myosin binding sites that are instrumental in forming cross-bridges. (b) When another protein complex, troponin, binds calcium ions, the binding sites on actin are exposed, cross-bridges with myosin can form, and the muscle contracts.

Calcium concentration in the cytosol of the muscle cell is regulated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized endoplasmic reticulum (FIGURE 49.35). The membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum actively transports calcium from the cytosol into the interior of the reticulum, which is thus an intracellular storehouse for calcium.

Fig 49-35. The roles of the muscle fiber's sarcoplasmic reticulum and T tubules in contraction. Diffusing across the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine depolarizes the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, and action potentials (blue arrows) sweep across the fiber and deep into it along T (transverse) tubules. Within the muscle cell the action potentials trigger the release of Ca2+ (green dots) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. The Ca2+ initiates the sliding of filaments by triggering the binding of myosin to actin.

The stimulus leading to the contraction of a skeletal muscle cell is an action potential in a motor neuron that makes a synaptic connection with the muscle cell. The synaptic terminal of the motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, depolarizing the postsynaptic muscle cell and triggering an action potential in the muscle cell. That action potential is the signal for contraction. The action potential spreads deep into the interior of the muscle cell along infoldings of the plasma membrane called T (transverse) tubules. Where the transverse tubules contact the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the action potential changes the permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing it to release calcium ions. These calcium ions bind to troponin, allowing the muscle to contract. Muscle contraction stops when the sarcoplasmic reticulum pumps the calcium back out of the cytosol, and the tropomyosin-troponin complex again blocks the myosin binding sites as the concentration of calcium falls (FIGURE 49.36).

Fig 49-36. Review of skeletal muscle contraction.





 Diverse body movements require variation in muscle activity

Everyday experience suggests that the action of a whole muscle, such as the biceps, is graded; we can voluntarily alter the extent and strength of contraction. Experimental studies also confirm that whole-muscle contractions are graded. However, at the cellular level, any stimulus that depolarizes the plasma membrane of a single muscle fiber triggers an all-or-none contraction, analogous to the response of neurons to depolarizing stimuli. How does the nervous system produce graded contractions of whole muscles? One way is by varying the frequency of action potentials in the motor neurons controlling the muscle. A single action potential will produce an increase in muscle tension lasting about 100 msec or less, a single twitch (FIGURE 49.37). If a second action potential arrives before the response to the first is over, the tension will sum and produce a greater response. If a muscle receives an overlapping series of action potentials, further summation will occur, with the level of tension depending on the rate of stimulation. And if the rate of stimulation is fast enough, the twitches will blur into one smooth and sustained contraction called tetanus (not to be confused with the disease of the same name). Motor neurons usually deliver their action potentials in rapid-fire volleys, and the resulting summation of tension results in smooth contraction typical of tetanus rather than the jerky actions of individual muscle twitches.

Fig 49-37. Temporal summation of muscle cell contractions. This graph compares the tension developed in a muscle in response to a single action potential, a pair of action potentials, and a series of action potentials. The dashed lines show the response that would have resulted if only the first action potential had occurred.

The nervous system can also produce graded contraction of a whole muscle by taking advantage of the organization of the muscle cells into motor units. In a vertebrate muscle, each muscle cell is innervated by only one motor neuron, but each branched motor neuron may make synaptic connections with many muscle cells (FIGURE 49.38). There may be hundreds of motor neurons controlling an individual muscle, each with its own pool of muscle fibers scattered throughout the muscle. A motor unit consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it controls. When the motor neuron fires, all the muscle fibers in the motor unit contract as a group. The strength of the resulting contraction will therefore depend on how many muscle fibers the motor neuron controls. In most muscles there is wide variation in the number of muscle fibers among motor units; some motor neurons may control only a few muscle cells, while others may control hundreds. The nervous system can thus regulate the strength of contraction in the whole muscle by both determining how many motor units are activated at a given instant and selecting whether large or small motor units are activated. Tension in a muscle can be progressively increased by activating more and more of the motor neurons controlling the muscle, a process called recruitment of motor neurons. Depending on the number and size of motor neurons your brain recruits to the task, you can lift a fork, or something much heavier, like your biology textbook.

Fig 49-38. Motor units in a vertebrate muscle. Each muscle fiber (cell) has a single neuromuscular junction, or synaptic connection, with the motor neuron that controls it. However, each motor neuron typically branches and controls several or many muscle fibers. A motor neuron and all the fibers it controls constitute a contractile apparatus called a motor unit.

Some muscles, especially those that hold the body up and maintain posture, are almost always partially contracted. However, prolonged contraction results in muscle fatigue caused by the depletion of ATP, dissipation of the ion gradients required for normal electrical signaling, and the accumulation of lactate (see FIGURE 9.17). In a mechanism that avoids fatigue in postural muscles, the nervous system alternates activation among the various motor units making up the muscle, so that different motor units take turns maintaining the prolonged contraction.

Fast and Slow Muscle Fibers

We have seen that the action potential in a skeletal muscle fiber is only a trigger for the contraction; the actual duration of the contraction is controlled by how long the calcium concentration in the cytosol remains elevated. Not all skeletal muscle fibers are identical in this regard. We can identify fast and slow fibers based on the duration of their twitches. Fast muscle fibers are used for rapid, powerful contractions. Some, such as the flight muscles of birds, may be able to sustain long periods of repeated contractions without fatiguing. By contrast, slow muscle fibers, which can sustain long contractions, are often found in muscles that maintain posture. A slow fiber has less sarcoplasmic reticulum than a fast fiber, so calcium remains in the cytosol longer. This causes a twitch in a slow fiber to last about five times longer than in a fast fiber. Slow fibers are also specialized to make use of a steady supply of energy; they have many mitochondria, a rich blood supply, and an oxygen-storing protein called myoglobin. Myoglobin, the brownish-red pigment in the dark meat of poultry and fish, binds oxygen more tightly than hemoglobin, so it can effectively extract oxygen from the blood.

Other Types of Muscle

There are many types of muscles in the animal kingdom, but as noted before, they all share the same fundamental mechanism of contraction: the sliding of actin filaments and myosin filaments past one another. In addition to skeletal muscle, vertebrates have cardiac muscle and smooth muscle (see FIGURE 40.4).

Vertebrate cardiac muscle is found in only one place--the heart. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated. The primary differences between skeletal and cardiac muscle are in their electrical and membrane properties. The junctions between cardiac muscle cells contain specialized regions called intercalated discs, where gap junctions (see FIGURE 7.30) provide direct electrical coupling among cells. Thus, an action potential generated in one part of the heart will spread to all the cardiac muscle cells, and the whole heart will contract. Skeletal muscle cells will not contract unless triggered to do so by input from a controlling motor neuron. Cardiac muscle cells, however, can generate action potentials on their own, without any input from the nervous system. The plasma membrane of a cardiac muscle cell has pacemaker properties that cause rhythmic depolarizations, triggering action potentials and causing single cardiac muscle cells to "beat" even when isolated from the heart and placed in cell culture. (But at the whole-organ level, the heart also has a pacemaker, specialized muscle tissue in the wall of the right atrium that coordinates contractions of cardiac muscle cells throughout the heart; see FIGURE 42.7.) The action potentials of cardiac muscle cells are also different from those of skeletal muscle cells, lasting up to twenty times longer. Whereas the action potential of a skeletal muscle cell serves only as a trigger for contraction and does not control the duration of contraction, in a cardiac cell the duration of the action potential plays an important role in controlling the duration of contraction.

Smooth muscle lacks the striations of skeletal and cardiac muscle because the actin and myosin filaments are not all regularly arrayed along the length of the cell. Instead, the filaments may have a spiral arrangement within smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle also contains less myosin than striated muscle, and the myosin is not associated with specific actin strands. Because of its organization, smooth muscle cannot generate nearly as much tension as striated muscle, but it can contract over a much greater range of lengths. Further, smooth muscle has neither a T tubule system nor a well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions must enter the cytosol via the plasma membrane during an action potential, and the amount reaching the filaments is rather small. Contractions are relatively slow, but there is a greater range of control than in striated muscle. Smooth muscle is found mainly in the walls of hollow organs such as digestive tract organs and blood vessels.

Invertebrates possess muscle cells similar to vertebrate skeletal and smooth muscle cells. Arthropod skeletal muscles are nearly identical to vertebrate skeletal muscles. However, the flight muscles of insects are capable of independent, rhythmic contraction, so the wings of some insects can actually beat faster than action potentials can arrive from the central nervous system. Another interesting evolutionary adaptation has been discovered in the muscles that hold clam shells closed. The thick filaments of these muscle fibers contain a unique protein called paramyosin that enables the muscles to remain in a fixed state of contraction with a low rate of energy consumption for as long as a month.

Although we have discussed sensory receptors and muscles separately in this chapter, they are part of a single integrated system linking together brain, body, and the external world. An animal's behavior, how the animal interacts with its environment, is the product of this system. Behavior is discussed in Unit Eight within the broader context of ecology, the study of interactions between organisms and their environment.

Organisms are open systems that interact continuously with their environments--a theme that has already surfaced many times in this book. The scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environments is called ecology (from the Greek oikos, home, and logos, to study). It is these interactions that determine both the distribution and abundance of organisms, resulting in the two questions that ecologists so often ask about organisms: Where do they live? And how many are there? Ecology is an enormously complex and exciting area of biology that is also of critical practical importance. Photographs of our planet taken by Apollo astronauts, such as the one on this page, remind us that Earth is a finite home in the vastness of space, not an unlimited frontier for human activity. The science of ecology can provide us with the basic understanding that we need to manage our planet's limited resources.

This chapter introduces the breadth of ecology and surveys some of the factors, both living and nonliving, that affect the distribution of organisms.

 The interactions between organisms and their environments determine the distribution and abundance of organisms



 

 Ecology and evolutionary biology are closely related sciences



 

 Ecological research ranges from the adaptations of individual organisms to the dynamics of the biosphere



 

 Ecology provides a scientific context for evaluating environmental issues



Humans have always had an interest in the distribution and abundance of other organisms. As hunters and gatherers, prehistoric people had to learn where game and edible plants could be found in greatest abundance. Naturalists, from Aristotle to Darwin, made the process of observing and describing organisms in their natural habitats an end in itself, rather than simply a means of survival. Because extraordinary insight can still be gained through this descriptive approach of discovery science (see Chapter 1), natural history remains a fundamental part of ecology.

Although ecology has a long history as a descriptive science, it is becoming increasingly experimental. In spite of the difficulty of conducting field experiments over large areas and over many years, many ecologists are testing hypotheses in the field. For example, in 1993, oceanographers added dissolved iron to a 64-km2 area of open ocean in the equatorial Pacific to test on a large scale the hypothesis that a shortage of iron as an inorganic nutrient was limiting production in this ecosystem. The experiment was repeated in 1995 on an even larger scale with similar results--greatly increased phytoplankton growth when the iron was added. These kinds of field experiments make ecology a rapidly growing and exciting science.





FACTORS AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANISMS

 

 Species dispersal contributes to the distribution of organisms



 

 Behavior and habitat selection contribute to the distribution of organisms



 

 Biotic factors affect the distribution of organisms



 

 Abiotic factors affect the distribution of organisms



 

 Temperature and water are the major climatic factors determining the distribution of organisms



Ecologists have long recognized striking global and regional patterns in the distribution of organisms within the biosphere. Kangaroos occur in Australia but not in North America, while pronghorn antelope occur in the western United States but not in Europe or Africa. More than a century ago, Darwin, Wallace, and other naturalists began to recognize broad patterns of geographic distribution by naming biogeographic realms (FIGURE 50.4). We now associate these realms with patterns of continental drift that followed the breakup of Pangaea (see FIGURE 25.4).

Fig 50-4. Biogeographic realms. Continental drift and barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges all contribute to the distinctive floras and faunas found in Earth's major regions. The realms are not sharply delineated but grade together in zones where taxa from adjacent realms coexist.

Biogeography is the study of the past and present distribution of individual species. We discussed biogeography in the context of geologic history in Chapters 22 and 25. The field of biogeography provides a good starting point to understanding what limits geographic distributions. To determine what limits the geographic distribution of any particular species, ecologists ask a series of questions (FIGURE 50.5). Let's work our way through this flowchart of inquiry.

AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL BIOMES

 

 Aquatic biomes occupy the largest part of the biosphere



 

 The geographic distribution of terrestrial biomes is based mainly on regional variations in climate



Having examined some of the factors that determine the distribution of organisms on Earth, we now turn to a brief survey of the major types of ecosystems, the biomes, beginning with the aquatic biomes (FIGURE 50.17).

THE SPATIAL SCALE OF DISTRIBUTIONS

 

 Different factors may determine the distribution of a species on different scales



 

 Most species have small geographic ranges



Throughout this chapter, we have examined abiotic factors, such as climate, and biotic factors, such as predation, that contribute to the distribution of the biosphere's diverse species. We have assumed that it is reasonably straightforward to map the geographic range of a species. But this assumption breaks down as we map the detailed distribution of a species in a local area. No species occurs everywhere throughout its range.





 The interactions between organisms and their environments determine the distribution and abundance of organisms

Ecologists use observations and manipulative experiments to test hypotheses aimed at such questions as, Why don't sequoia trees grow in Colorado? Why are there no malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Minnesota? Why are there so many deer in Ohio? What caused the extinction of the passenger pigeon?

FIGURE 50.1 shows the geographic range of the red kangaroo in Australia and graphically illustrates the basis for two major questions ecologists try to answer. What factors limit the geographic range, or distribution, of a species? And what factors determine its abundance? Given a hypothesis, or suggested explanation, for one of these questions, ecologists make predictions of what should be observed in nature or what the outcome of an experiment should be. In some cases, they can devise mathematical models that enable them to simulate the possible results of large-scale experiments that are impossible to conduct in the field. In this approach, important variables and their hypothetical relationships are described through mathematical equations. The potential ways in which the variables interact can then be studied. For example, many ecologists and climatologists use sophisticated computer programs to develop models that predict the effects that human activities will have on climate and how the resulting climatic changes will affect geographic distributions of life-forms during the next century. Of course, such simulations are only as good as the basic information on which the models are based, and obtaining that information requires extensive laboratory work and fieldwork.

The environment of any organism includes abiotic components (nonliving chemical and physical factors), such as temperature, light, water, and nutrients, and biotic (living) components--all the organisms that are part of any individual's environment. Other organisms may compete with an individual for food and resources, prey upon it, or change its physical and chemical environment. As we will see, questions about the relative importance of various environmental components are frequently at the heart of ecological studies--and some accompanying controversies.





 Ecology and evolutionary biology are closely related sciences

Many biologists recognize Charles Darwin as an able naturalist whose observations laid the groundwork for the later development of ecology. Indeed, it was the geographic distribution of organisms and their exquisite adaptations to specific environments that provided Darwin with evidence for evolution (see Chapter 22). An important cause of evolutionary change is the interaction of organisms with their environment. Thus, events that occur in the framework of ecological time (minutes, months, years) translate into effects over the longer scale of evolutionary time (decades, centuries, millennia, and longer). For instance, hawks feeding on field mice have an immediate (ecological) impact on the prey population by killing certain individuals, thereby reducing population size and altering the gene pool. One long-term evolutionary effect of this predator-prey interaction may be selection for mice with fur coloration that camouflages the animals.





 Ecological research ranges from the adaptations of individual organisms to the dynamics of the biosphere

Because there are many levels and types of interactions between organisms and their environments, the questions ecologists address are wide-ranging and complex. Ecology can be divided into four increasingly comprehensive levels of study, from the ecology of individual organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems (FIGURE 50.2).

Fig 50-2. Sample questions at different levels of ecology. (a) Organismal ecology. How do diving whales select their feeding areas? (b) Population ecology. What factors limit the number of striped mice that can inhabit a particular area? (c) Community ecology. What factors influence the diversity of tree species that make up a particular forest? (d) Ecosystem ecology. What processes recycle vital chemical elements, such as nitrogen, within a savanna ecosystem?

Organismal ecology is concerned with the morphological, physiological, and behavioral ways in which individual organisms meet the challenges posed by their biotic and abiotic environments. The geographic distribution of organisms is often limited by the abiotic conditions they can tolerate.

A population is a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular geographic area. Population ecology concentrates mainly on factors that affect how many individuals of a particular species live in an area.

A community consists of all the organisms of all the species that inhabit a particular area; it is an assemblage of populations of many different species. Thus, community ecology deals with the whole array of interacting species in a community. This level of research focuses on the ways in which interactions such as predation, competition, and disease affect community structure and organization.

An ecosystem consists of all the abiotic factors in addition to the entire community of species that exist in a certain area. An ecosystem--a lake, for example--may contain many different communities. In ecosystem ecology, the emphasis is on energy flow and the cycling of chemicals among the various biotic and abiotic components.

Looking beyond the four basic levels of ecology, we come to landscape ecology, which deals with arrays of ecosystems and how they are arranged in a geographic region. A landscape or seascape consists of several different ecosystems linked by exchanges of energy, materials, and organisms. The landscape level of research focuses on the ways in which interactions among populations, communities, and ecosystems are affected by the juxtaposition of different ecosystems, such as streams, lakes, old-growth forests, and forest patches that have had their trees removed by clear-cut logging.

The biosphere is the global ecosystem--the sum of all the planet's ecosystems. The most extensive level in ecology, the biosphere includes the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers, the land down to and including water-bearing rocks at least 3,000 m belowground, lakes and streams, caves, and the oceans to a depth of several kilometers. An example of research at the biosphere level is the analysis of how changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration affect global climate.





 Ecology provides a scientific context for evaluating environmental issues

The science of ecology should be distinguished from the informal use of the same word to refer to environmental concerns. And yet, we need to understand the often complicated and delicate relationships between organisms and their environments in order to address environmental problems.

Much of our current awareness about the environment had its beginnings in 1962 with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (FIGURE 50.3). In that now-classic book, Carson warned that the widespread use of pesticides such as DDT was causing population declines in many nontarget organisms. Today, acid precipitation, localized famine aggravated by land misuse and population growth, the poisoning of soil and streams with toxic wastes, and the growing list of species extinct or endangered because of habitat destruction are just a few of the problems that threaten the home we share with millions of other forms of life.

Fig 50-3. Rachel Carson. Although her Silent Spring, a book seminal to the modern environmental movement, focused on the biosphere's hangover from the pesticide DDT, Carson's message was much broader: "The 'control of nature' is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man."

Many influential ecologists, including David Schindler, the scientist you met in this unit's interview, recognize their responsibility to educate legislators and the general public about decisions that affect the environment. An important part of this responsibility is communicating the scientific complexity of environmental issues. Politicians and lawyers often want definitive answers to such environmental questions as, How much old-growth forest is needed to save spotted owls? While ecological studies can certainly provide essential information for making policy decisions on habitat preservation, responses to such questions often include further questions: How many owls must be saved? With what certainty must they be saved? How long can they survive in this amount of forest? Ecologists can help answer these questions so that the public can make informed decisions about environmental concerns.

Although our ecological information is always incomplete, we cannot abstain from making decisions until all the answers are known. A guiding principle here is the precautionary principle, which can be expressed simply as "Look before you leap" or "An ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure." Aldo Leopold, the famous wildlife conservationist, expressed the precautionary principle well when he wrote, "To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution to intelligent tinkering."





 Species dispersal contributes to the distribution of organisms

Why are there no kangaroos in North America? The biogeographer answers with the simplest response: They could not get there because of barriers to dispersal; the area was inaccessible to kangaroos. The dispersal of organisms is a critical process for understanding both geographic isolation in evolution (see Chapter 24) and the broad patterns of current geographic distributions.

Species Transplants

One way to determine if dispersal is a key factor limiting distribution is by observing the results when humans have accidentally or intentionally transplanted a species to areas where that species was previously absent. Some organisms can survive in new areas but cannot reproduce there, so we cannot determine the success of a transplant until at least one life cycle is complete. The two possible outcomes of the transplant direct further research.

OutcomeInterpretationTransplant successfulDistribution limited because the area is inaccessible, time has been too short to reach the area, or the species fails to recognize the area as suitable living spaceTransplant unsuccessfulDistribution limited either by other species or by physical and chemical factorsIf a transplant is successful, then the potential range of the species is larger than its actual range, as FIGURE 50.6 illustrates for a hypothetical species. If a species does not occupy all of its potential range, we must determine why. Does the species lack suitable means of dispersal to reach new areas? Some animal species can in fact move into new areas but "choose" not to do so. For these species, we must study their mechanisms of habitat selection.

Fig 50-6. Set of transplant experiments for a hypothetical species. The results of many separate transplant experiments would be needed to define the limits of the potential range; only four are shown here.

If the species cannot survive and reproduce in the transplant areas, we must ask whether biotic or abiotic factors exclude it from these areas. Limits imposed by other species (biotic factors) may involve the negative effects of predators, parasites, pathogens, or competitors. Or the transplant area could lack required positive effects of interdependent species, such as pollinators that are present within the actual range of a transplanted angiosperm. If other species do not set limits on the range, we are left with the last possibility that physical or chemical factors (abiotic factors) set the geographic range limits. For example, many tropical plant species cannot withstand freezing temperatures, and the frost line effectively limits their distribution.

A proper transplant experiment should have a control, transplants done within the existing distribution to provide data on the effects of handling and transplanting the individual organisms. However, ecologists rarely conduct transplant experiments today. Instead, they document the outcomes when species have been transplanted for other purposes, such as to introduce game animals, or when species have been accidentally transplanted.

Problems with Introduced Species

Although many species are naturally restricted to particular biogeographic realms by their dispersal abilities, humans have managed to move species around the globe, particularly during the last 200 years. In fact, the most spectacular examples of dispersal affecting distribution occur when species that have been deliberately or accidentally introduced by humans explode to occupy a new area. Let's examine a couple of examples.

The African Honeybee. The African honeybee is a good example of how the human introduction of a species to new areas can have unpredicted and undesirable consquences. The African honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata) is a very aggressive subspecies of honeybee that was brought to Brazil in 1956 to breed a variety that would produce more honey in the tropics than the standard Italian honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica). The African bees escaped by accident in 1957 and have been spreading throughout the Americas ever since (FIGURE 50.7). Because African bees are aggressive, they may drive out the established colonies of Italian honeybees. In other situations, hybrids form between the African and Italian subspecies. In 1982, the African honeybee crossed the Panama Canal. It reached Mexico in 1985 and southern Texas in 1990. Moving roughly 110 km per year, it crossed the border into California in 1994 and is currently spreading into the southern United States. By December 2000, the African bee had reached northern Texas, southern California, southern Nevada, and all of Arizona. Unfortunately, African bees are aggressive toward humans and domestic animals, and accounts of severe stinging and even deaths have served to map the spread of the African bee. By 2000, ten people had been killed by these bees in the United States, and beekeepers are understandably worried that the African bee will damage the established honeybee industry. What factors limit the distribution of the African honeybee in North America? Will this species be able to live as far north as northern California and North Carolina? Will cold winters prevent it from moving farther north? Ecologists do not yet know the answers to these questions.

The Zebra Mussel. In 1988, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a fingernail-sized mollusk native to the freshwater Caspian Sea of Asia, was discovered in Lake St. Claire near Detroit. No one knows for sure how the species got transplanted there. The best guess is that around 1985, a ship carried larvae of the mussel in its ballast water from a freshwater port in Europe to the Great Lakes, where the ballast water was emptied with no concern about what organisms it might contain.

The zebra mussel quickly became a pest in North America. It reproduces rapidly and forms dense clusters several layers thick on hard surfaces. The mussels were first noticed when they reached densities of 750,000 per square meter in water pipes in Lake Erie and clogged the water intakes of city water systems, electrical power stations, and other industrial facilities in the Great Lakes.

Since 1988, zebra mussels have spread rapidly in the river systems of the central United States (FIGURE 50.8). Because they are such efficient suspension feeders, zebra mussels actually make the water much clearer, but they alter the native communities of organisms in the process. By feeding on phytoplankton, the mussels depress populations of zooplankton; and the clearer water admits more sunlight, increasing the growth of rooted aquatic plants in shallow waters. In the Hudson River in New York, phytoplankton biomass was reduced about 85%  after zebra mussels invaded; zooplankton, which feed on phytoplankton, declined by more than 70% . Some fish and ducks eat zebra mussels, but these predators are too few to slow down population growth of the mussels. Zebra mussels crowd out native mollusk species by colonizing all hard surfaces, including the shells of freshwater clams. The result can be local extinction of the native species.

The Tens Rule. Not all introduced species thrive in their new homes, and many of the species humans have moved around the globe have failed to colonize new areas. For example, bird introductions into continental areas are usually failures. In North America, for example, only 13 species of introduced birds are common, although 98 species have been introduced. In Europe, only 13 successful establishments of birds are recorded out of 85 species introduced. A rough generalization for the success of introduced species is the tens rule, which makes the statistical prediction that an average of one out of ten introduced species become established, and one out of ten established species become common enough to become pests.

The ability of species to disperse is important on a global scale but rarely an important factor limiting the local distribution of organisms. Species have many special adaptations for dispersal and often colonize nearby areas. On a global scale, barriers to dispersal help to determine the biogeographic distribution patterns among continents and islands. The ability of humans to overcome these barriers and move species is just one example of how we are altering the biosphere.





 Behavior and habitat selection contribute to the distribution of organisms

Some organisms do not occupy all their potential range, even though they are physically able to disperse into the unoccupied areas. In these cases, individuals seem to avoid certain habitats, even when the habitats are suitable. Thus, the distribution of a species may be limited by the behavior of individuals in selecting habitat. Habitat selection is typically thought of only with respect to animals, but plant species can also select their habitats, even though individual plants cannot move. How organisms select the type of habitat to occupy is one of the least understood ecological processes.

Insects often have very stereotyped oviposition (egg-depositing) behavior, and this may restrict their local distribution to certain host plants. Consider the European corn borer, for example, whose larvae will feed on a wide variety of plants but occur almost exclusively on corn because the ovipositing females are attracted by volatile odors produced by the corn plant. The complex chemical signaling between plants and herbivorous insects and pollinators is an important research area in the study of plant-herbivore interactions.

Anopheline mosquitoes are important carriers of disease, and their ecology has been studied extensively because of the difficulty of malaria eradication in tropical areas. Each mosquito species is usually associated with a particular type of breeding place, and one of the striking observations that a student of malaria first makes is that large areas of water in the tropics are completely free of dangerous mosquitoes. Habitat selection for oviposition sites by female mosquitoes appears to restrict their distribution. Larvae can develop successfully over a much wider range of conditions than those in which eggs are laid.

The key point in these examples is that evolution does not produce perfect organisms for every suitable habitat. Adaptation can never be exact and instantaneous, and we must be careful not to expect perfection in organisms (see Chapter 23). We may judge a tropical mosquito deficient for not laying eggs in all suitable rice field habitats, but this failing may only reflect the fact that rice fields are a recent habitat in evolutionary time. In addition, not all behavior that has evolved remains adaptive, particularly in ecosystems modified by humans. Environmental conditions may change such that behaviors that were formerly adaptive are now maladaptive. Ground-nesting birds on islands, for example, are threatened if new ground predators (rats, for example) colonize the island. Populations cannot evolve overnight. Even with suitable genetic variation in a population, natural selection may not be able to operate quickly enough to adjust habitat selection behavior to some abrupt environmental change.





 Biotic factors affect the distribution of organisms

Frequently, a species cannot complete its full life cycle if transplanted to an area it did not originally occupy. One reason for this inability to survive and reproduce may be negative interactions with other organisms through predation, disease, and competition. Or there may be an absence of other species upon which the transplanted species depends, such as the absence of specific pollinators in the case of a transplanted plant species.

In predation we find some of the clearest cases of biotic limitation on geographic distribution. Carnivorous predators, such as wolves, kill their prey. And herbivores, such as grazing mammals and most insects, also function as predators, eating parts of plants or whole plants.

Let's examine a specific case of a predator limiting the distribution of a prey species. In certain marine ecosystems, there is often an inverse relationship between the abundance of sea urchins and the abundance of seaweeds (large algae, such as kelp). Where sea urchins that graze on kelp are common, kelp cannot become established. Thus, the local distribution of kelp can be limited by sea urchins. This kind of interaction can be tested by "removal and addition" experiments. If the hypothesis that sea urchins are a biotic factor limiting kelp distribution is correct, then kelp should invade an area from which sea urchins have been removed. Conversely, if urchins are added to an area rich in kelp, the kelp should be eliminated. One complication is that there are often several other herbivores in addition to sea urchins; thus, careful manipulative experiments are needed to determine the reasons for the kelp being absent. You can see the results of some careful predator-removal experiments in FIGURE 50.9.

Fig 50-9. Predator-removal experiments. Researchers tested the effects of two herbivores, sea urchins and limpets (mollusks), on the abundance of seaweeds in adjacent subtidal areas near Sydney, Australia. In areas where both sea urchins and limpets were present (red line), there was virtually no algal cover present. Predator-removal experiments in areas adjacent to the control site supported the hypothesis that sea urchins are the main herbivores limiting distribution of the seaweeds.

Many organisms are limited in their local distribution by the presence of food resources, predators, diseases, and competitors. Unfortunately, some of the most dramatic cases occur when humans introduce (either accidentally or intentionally) exotic predators or diseases into new areas and wipe out native species. We will see examples of these impacts in Chapter 55 when we discuss conservation ecology.





 Abiotic factors affect the distribution of organisms

Patterns of geographic distributions of organisms on a global scale are a broad reflection of the influence of abiotic factors. These patterns mainly mirror regional differences in temperature, rainfall, salinity (saltiness), and light. Throughout this discussion, it is important to remember that the environment varies in both space and time. Although two regions of Earth may experience different conditions at any given time, daily and annual fluctuations of abiotic factors sometimes blur or accentuate the distinctions between those regions.

Temperature

Environmental temperature is an important factor determining the distribution of organisms because of its effect on biological processes and the inability of most organisms to regulate body temperature precisely. Cells may rupture if the water they contain freezes (at temperatures below 0&#176;C), and the proteins of most organisms denature at temperatures above 45&#176;C. In addition, few organisms can maintain a sufficiently active metabolism at very low or very high temperatures. Within a suitable range, however, most biochemical reactions and physiological processes occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. Extraordinary adaptations enable some organisms, including thermophilic prokaryotes (see Chapter 27), to live outside the temperature range habitable by other life.

The internal temperature of an organism is affected by heat exchange with its environment (see Chapter 44), and most organisms cannot maintain tissue temperatures more than a few degrees above or below the ambient temperature. As endotherms, mammals and birds are the major exceptions, but even endotherms function best within certain environmental temperature ranges, which vary with the species.

Water

Water is essential to life, but its availability varies dramatically among habitats. Freshwater and marine organisms live submerged in an aquatic environment, but they face problems of water balance if their intracellular osmolarity does not match that of the surrounding water. Organisms in terrestrial environments encounter a nearly constant threat of desiccation, and their evolution has been shaped by the requirements for obtaining and conserving adequate supplies of water.

Sunlight

Sunlight provides the energy that drives nearly all ecosystems, although only plants and other photosynthetic organisms use this energy source directly. Light intensity is not the most important factor limiting plant growth in many terrestrial environments, but shading by a forest canopy makes competition for light in the understory intense. In aquatic environments, the intensity and quality of light limit the distribution of photosynthetic organisms. Every meter of water depth selectively absorbs about 45%  of the red light and about 2%  of the blue light passing through it. As a result, most photosynthesis in aquatic environments occurs relatively near the surface. And the photosynthetic organisms themselves absorb some of the light that penetrates, further reducing light levels in the waters below.

Light is also important to the development and behavior of the many organisms that are sensitive to photoperiod, the relative lengths of daytime and nighttime. Photoperiod is a more reliable indicator than temperature for cuing seasonal events, such as flowering by plants or migration by animals.

Wind

Wind amplifies the effects of environmental temperature on organisms by increasing heat loss due to evaporation and convection (the wind-chill factor). It also contributes to water loss in organisms by increasing the rate of evaporation in animals and transpiration in plants. In addition, wind can have a substantial effect on the morphology of plants by inhibiting the growth of limbs on the windward side of trees; limbs on the leeward side grow normally, resulting in a "flagged" appearance.

Rocks and Soil

The physical structure, pH, and mineral composition of rocks and soil limit the distribution of plants and of the animals that feed upon them, thus contributing to the patchiness we see in terrestrial ecosystems. In streams and rivers, the composition of the substrate can affect water chemistry, which in turn influences the resident algae, plants, and animals. In marine environments, the structure of the substrates in the intertidal zone and on seafloors determines the types of organisms that can attach to or burrow in those habitats.

Now that we have surveyed the various factors that affect the distribution of organisms, let's focus on the major role that climate plays in structuring the biosphere.





 Temperature and water are the major climatic factors determining the distribution of organisms

Four abiotic factors--temperature, water, light, and wind--are the major components of climate, the prevailing weather conditions at a locality. Temperature and water are especially important as factors determining the geographic range of organisms.

Climate and Biomes

We can see the great impact of climate on the distribution of organisms by constructing a climograph, a plot of the temperature and rainfall in a particular region. For example, FIGURE 50.10 shows a climograph denoting annual mean temperature and precipitation for some of the biomes of North America. Biomes are major types of ecosystems, those that occupy broad geographic regions. Examples of biomes are coniferous forests, deserts, and grasslands. Notice in FIGURE 50.10 that the range of rainfall occurring in northern coniferous forests is similar to that of temperate forests, but the temperature ranges are different. Grasslands are generally drier than either kind of forest, and deserts are drier still.

Fig 50-10. A climograph for some major kinds of ecosystems (biomes) in North America. The areas plotted here encompass the range of annual mean temperature and precipitation occurring in the biomes.

Annual means for temperature and rainfall are reasonably well correlated with the biomes we find in different regions. However, we must always be careful to distinguish correlation from causation, a cause-and-effect relationship. Although our climograph provides circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall are important to the distribution of biomes, it does not prove that these variables govern their geographic location. Only a detailed analysis of the water and temperature tolerances of individual species could establish the controlling effects of these variables.

We can also see in our climograph that factors other than mean temperature and precipitation must play a role in determining which biomes are found where, because there are regions where biomes overlap. For example, certain areas in North America with a particular temperature and precipitation combination support a temperate forest, but other areas with the same values for these variables support a coniferous forest; still others support a grassland. How do we explain this variation? First, remember that the climograph is based on annual averages. Often it is not only the mean or average climate that is important but also the pattern of climatic variation. For example, some areas may get regular precipitation throughout the year, whereas others with the same annual amount of precipitation have distinct wet and dry seasons. A similar phenomenon may occur with respect to temperature. Other factors, such as the bedrock in an area, may greatly affect mineral nutrient availability and soil structure, which in turn affect the kind of vegetation that will develop.

With these complex considerations in mind, let's take a closer look at how climate affects the geographic distribution of organisms.

Global Climate Patterns

Earth's global climate patterns are largely determined by the input of solar energy and the planet's movement in space. The sun's warming effect on the atmosphere, land, and water establishes the temperature variations, cycles of air movement, and evaporation of water that are responsible for dramatic latitudinal variations in climate. Because solar radiation is most intense when the sun is directly overhead, the shape of the Earth causes latitudinal variation in the intensity of sunlight (FIGURE 50.11). However, the planet is also tilted on its axis by 23.5&#176; relative to its plane of orbit around the sun, and this tilt causes seasonal variation in the intensity of solar radiation (FIGURE 50.12). The tropics (those regions that lie between 23.5&#176; north latitude and 23.5&#176; south latitude) experience the greatest annual input and the least seasonal variation in solar radiation of any region on Earth. The seasonality of light and temperature increases steadily toward the poles; polar regions have long, cold winters with periods of continual darkness and short summers with periods of continual light.

Fig 50-11. Solar radiation and latitude. Because sunlight strikes the equator perpendicularly, more heat and light are delivered there per unit of surface area than at higher northern and southern latitudes, where sunlight has a longer path through the atmosphere and strikes the curved surface of Earth at an oblique angle.

Fig 50-12. What causes the seasons? The permanent tilt of the Earth on its axis causes seasonal variation in temperature and light intensity as the planet revolves around the sun.

Intense solar radiation near the equator initiates a global circulation of air, creating precipitation and winds (FIGURE 50.13). High temperatures in the tropics evaporate water from Earth's surface and cause warm, wet air masses to rise and flow toward the poles. The rising air masses release much of their water content, creating abundant precipitation in tropical regions. Thus, high temperatures, intense sunshine, and ample rainfall are all characteristic of a tropical climate, fostering the growth of lush vegetation in some tropical forests and the development of coral reefs. The high-altitude air masses, now dry, descend toward Earth at latitudes around 30&#176; north and south, absorbing moisture from the land and creating an arid climate conducive to the development of the deserts that are common at these latitudes. Some of the descending air then flows toward the poles at low altitude, depositing abundant precipitation (though less than in the tropics) where the air masses again rise and release moisture in the vicinity of 60&#176; latitude. Broad expanses of coniferous forest dominate the landscape at these fairly wet but generally cool latitudes. Some of the cold, dry rising air then flows to the poles, where it descends and flows back toward the equator, absorbing moisture and creating the comparatively rainless and bitterly cold climates of the Arctic and Antarctica.

Local and Seasonal Effects on Climate

Proximity to bodies of water and topographic features such as mountain ranges create a climatic patchiness on a regional scale, and smaller features of the landscape contribute to local climatic variation. These regional and local variations in climate create a number of ecosystems that are less widely spread than the major biomes.

Ocean currents influence climate along the coasts of continents by heating or cooling overlying air masses, which may then pass across the land. Evaporation from the ocean is also greater than it is over land, and coastal regions are generally moister than inland areas at the same latitude. The cool, misty climate produced by the cold California current that flows southward along the western United States supports a rain forest ecosystem dominated by large coniferous trees in the Pacific Northwest and large redwood groves farther south. Similarly, the warm Gulf Stream flowing north out of the Gulf of Mexico and across the North Atlantic tempers the climate on the west coast of the British Isles, making it warmer during winter than the coast of New England, which is actually farther south but is cooled by a current flowing south from the coast of Greenland.

As every vacationer knows, oceans (and large inland bodies of water) generally moderate the climate of nearby terrestrial environments. During a warm summer day, when the land is hotter than a large lake or the ocean, air over the land heats and rises, drawing a cool breeze from the water across the land. At night, by contrast, air over the warmer ocean or lake rises, establishing a circulation that draws cooler air from the land out over the water, replacing it with warmer air from offshore. Proximity to water does not always moderate climate, however. Several regions (including the coast of central and southern California) have a Mediterranean-like climate; in summer, cool, dry ocean breezes are warmed when they contact the land, absorbing moisture and creating hot, rainless summers just a few miles inland.

Mountains also have a significant effect on solar radiation, local temperature, and rainfall. South-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere receive more sunlight than nearby north-facing slopes and are therefore warmer and drier. In many of the mountains of western North America, spruce and other conifers occupy the north-facing slopes, whereas shrubby, drought-resistant vegetation inhabits many south-facing slopes. In addition, at any particular latitude, air temperature declines approximately 6&#176;C with every 1,000-m increase in elevation, paralleling the decline of temperature with increasing latitude. In the north temperate zone, for example, a 1,000-m increase in elevation produces a temperature change equivalent to that over an 880-km increase in latitude. This is one reason mountain communities are similar to those at lower elevation farther from the equator.

When warm, moist air approaches a mountain, it rises and cools, releasing moisture on the windward side of the range. On the leeward side of the mountain, cooler, dry air descends, absorbing moisture and producing a rain shadow (FIGURE 50.14). Deserts commonly occur on the leeward side of mountain ranges, a phenomenon evident in the Great Basin and Mojave Desert of western North America, the Gobi Desert of Asia, and in the small deserts that characterize the southwest corners of some Caribbean islands.

Fig 50-14. How mountains affect rainfall. This drawing represents major landforms across the state of Washington. As moist air moves in off the Pacific Ocean and encounters the westernmost mountains (the Coast Range), it flows upward, cools at higher altitudes, and drops a large amount of water. Some of the world's tallest trees, the Douglas firs, thrive here. Farther inland, precipitation increases again as the air moves up and over higher mountains (the Cascade Range). On the eastern side of the Cascades, there is little precipitation. As a result of this rain shadow, much of central Washington is very arid, almost qualifying as desert.

Seasonality generates local environmental variation in addition to the global changes in day length, solar radiation, and temperature described earlier. Because of the changing angle of the sun over the course of the year, the belts of wet and dry air on either side of the equator undergo slight seasonal shifts in latitude that produce marked wet and dry seasons around 20&#176; latitude, where tropical deciduous forests grow. In addition, seasonal changes in wind patterns produce variations in ocean currents, sometimes causing the upwelling of nutrientrich, cold water from deep ocean layers, thus nourishing organisms that live near the surface.

Ponds and lakes are also sensitive to seasonal temperature changes (FIGURE 50.15). During the summer and winter, many lakes in temperate regions are thermally stratified--that is, layered vertically according to temperature. Such lakes undergo a biannual mixing of their waters as a result of changing water temperature profiles. This turnover, as it is called, brings oxygenated water from the surface of lakes to the bottom and nutrient-rich water from the bottom to the surface in both spring and autumn (see FIGURE 50.15). These cyclic changes in the abiotic properties of lakes are essential for the survival and growth of organisms at all levels within this ecosystem.

Fig 50-15. Lake stratification and seasonal turnover. Lakes in temperate zones tend to stratify by temperature and density in winter and summer. The biannual mixing of lake waters occurs because water is most dense at 4&#176;C, and water at that temperature sinks below water that is either warmer or colder.

Microclimate

Climate also varies on a very fine scale, called microclimate. For example, ecologists often refer to the microclimate on a forest floor or under a rock. Many features in the environment influence microclimates by casting shade, affecting evaporation from soil, and changing the patterns of wind. Forest trees frequently moderate the microclimate below. Cleared areas generally experience greater temperature extremes than the forest interior because of greater solar radiation and wind currents that are established by the rapid heating and cooling of open land; evaporation is generally greater in clearings as well. Low-lying ground is usually wetter than high ground and tends to be occupied by different species of trees within the same forest. If you have ever lifted a log or large stone in the woods, you are well aware that there are organisms (such as salamanders, worms, and insects) that live in the shelter of this microenvironment, buffered from the extremes of temperature and moisture. Every environment on Earth is similarly characterized by a mosaic of small-scale differences in the abiotic factors that influence the local distributions of organisms.

Long-Term Climate Change

If temperature and moisture are the master limiting factors for the geographic ranges of plants and animals, the climatic warming that is under way during the 21st century will have profound effects on the biosphere. (The causes and consequences of global warming are discussed in detail in Chapter 54.) One way to get a glimpse of the kinds of changes that may occur is to look back at the changes that have occurred in temperate regions since the end of the last ice age.

The last continental glaciers began retreating in North America and Eurasia about 16,000 years ago. The northward expansion of tree distributions lagged behind the retreat of the ice. A detailed record of these migrations is captured in fossil pollen deposited in lakes and ponds. (It may seem odd to think of trees "migrating," but recall from Chapter 38 that wind and animals can disperse seeds, sometimes over great distances.) In North America, oaks and maples moved rapidly in a northeastward direction from the Mississippi Valley, while hickories advanced more slowly. Hemlocks and white pines moved northwestward from refuges along the Atlantic coast. The important conclusion from this research is that various tree species advanced their range at different rates. If you were sitting in New Hampshire and lived a very long time, you would have seen sugar maple trees arrive 9,000 years ago, hemlock 7,500 years ago, and beech trees 6,500 years ago.

If we can determine the climatic limits of current geographic distributions for organisms, we can make predictions about how distributions will change with climatic warming. A major question when applying this approach to plants is whether seed dispersal is rapid enough to sustain the migration of each species as climate changes. For example, fossils suggest that eastern hemlock was delayed nearly 2,500 years in its movement north at the end of the Ice Age partly because of relatively slow seed dispersal.

Let's look at a specific case of how the fossil record of past tree migrations can inform predictions about the biological impact of the current global warming trend. FIGURE 50.16 shows the current and potential geographic range of the American beech (Fagus grandifolia) under two climate-change models. These models predict that the potential northern limit of the beech's range will move 700-900 km north in the next century, and the southern range limit will shrink to the north as well. If left to natural processes, the beech must move 7-9 km per year to the north to keep pace with the warming climate. By contrast, since the end of the Ice Age, the beech migrated into its present range at a rate of only 0.2 km per year. If these predictions are even approximately correct, migrating species such as beech trees will require human assistance to move into new ranges where they can survive as the climate warms. If this does not occur, beech and many other species may become extinct.

 Aquatic biomes occupy the largest part of the biosphere

Aquatic biomes account for the largest part of the biosphere in terms of area. Ecologists distinguish between freshwater biomes and marine biomes on the basis of physical and chemical differences. For example, marine biomes generally have salt concentrations that average 3% , whereas freshwater biomes are usually characterized by a salt concentration of less than 1% .

Covering about 75%  of Earth's surface, oceans have always had an enormous impact on the biosphere. The evaporation of seawater provides most of the planet's rainfall, and ocean temperatures have a major effect on world climate and wind patterns. In addition, marine algae and photosynthetic bacteria supply a substantial portion of the world's oxygen and consume huge amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Freshwater biomes are closely linked to the soils and biotic components of the terrestrial biomes through which they pass or in which they are situated. The particular characteristics of a freshwater biome are also influenced by the patterns and speed of water flow and the climate to which the biome is exposed.

Vertical Stratification of Aquatic Biomes

Many aquatic biomes exhibit pronounced vertical stratification of physical and chemical variables. Light is absorbed by both the water itself and the microorganisms in it, so that its intensity decreases rapidly with depth. Ecologists distinguish between the upper photic zone, where there is sufficient light for photosynthesis, and the lower aphotic zone, where little light penetrates. Water temperature also tends to be stratified, especially during summer and winter (see FIGURE 50.15). Heat energy from sunlight warms the surface waters to whatever depth the sunlight penetrates, but the deeper waters remain quite cold. In the ocean and in many temperate-zone lakes, a narrow stratum of rapid temperature change called a thermocline separates a more uniformly warm upper layer from more uniformly cold deeper waters. At the bottom of all aquatic biomes, the substrate is called the benthic zone. Made up of sand and organic and inorganic sediments ("ooze"), the benthic zone is occupied by communities of organisms collectively called benthos. A major source of food for the benthos is dead organic matter called detritus. In lakes and oceans, detritus "rains" down from the productive surface waters of the photic zone.

Freshwater Biomes

There are two general categories of freshwater biomes: standing bodies of water (such as lakes and ponds) and moving bodies of water (rivers and streams). Standing bodies of water range from small ponds that are a few square meters to large lakes that are thousands of square kilometers in area. In most lakes, communities of organisms are distributed according to the depth of the water and its distance from shore (FIGURE 50.18). Rooted and floating aquatic plants flourish in the littoral zone, the shallow, well-lit waters close to shore. In a lake, the well-lit, open surface waters farther from shore, called the limnetic zone, are occupied by a variety of phytoplankton consisting of algae and cyanobacteria. These organisms photosynthesize and reproduce at a high rate during spring and summer. Zooplankton, mostly rotifers and small crustaceans, graze on the phytoplankton. The zooplankton are consumed by many small fish, which in turn become food for larger fish, semiaquatic snakes and turtles, and fish-eating birds.

Fig 50-18. Zonation in a lake.

Most of the small organisms of a lake's limnetic zone are short-lived, and their remains continually sink into a deep aphotic region, called the profundal zone, and down to the benthic zone. Microbes in the profundal and benthic zones use oxygen for cellular respiration as they decompose this detritus.

Lakes are often classified according to their production of organic matter. Oligotrophic lakes are deep and nutrient-poor, and the phytoplankton in the limnetic zone are relatively sparse and not very productive (FIGURE 50.19a). Eutrophic lakes, in contrast, are usually shallower, and the nutrient content of their water is high. As a result, the phytoplankton are very productive, and the waters are often quite murky (FIGURE 50.19b). Between the oligotrophic and eutrophic extremes are lakes with a moderate amount of nutrients and phytoplankton productivity; these lakes are said to be mesotrophic.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 50-19. Freshwater biomes. (a) Oligotrophic lakes, such as Lake Baikal (shown here), in Siberia, are nutrient-poor with a small surface area relative to depth. The bottom sediments are low in decomposable organic matter, limiting bacterial populations in the benthos. The shortage of nutrients in the water limits photosynthesis by plankton in the limnetic zone; as a result, the water is clear and oxygen-rich and usually supports diverse populations of fish and invertebrates. (b) Eutrophic lakes, such as this one called Peck's Pond, in the Pocono Mountains of eastern Pennsylvania, are nutrient-rich and generally have a larger surface area relative to depth. The availability of nutrients supports a high rate of photosynthesis, leading to murkier water than that of an oligotrophic lake. High organic content in the benthos leads to high decomposition rates and potentially low oxygen supplies in the profundal and benthic zones. (c) Rivers and streams support substantially different biological communities than those in ponds and lakes. The photograph shows the mouth of a stream, flowing into the much larger Snake River, in Idaho.

Over long periods of time, oligotrophic lakes may become mesotrophic and eventually eutrophic as runoff from the surrounding land brings in additional sediments and nutrients. Unfortunately, human activities often speed this natural process dramatically. Runoff from fertilized lawns and agricultural fields and the dumping of municipal wastes enrich the lakes with excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus; the normally low concentrations of these nutrients limit the growth of algae, including phytoplankton. The result of such pollution is often a population explosion of algae, the production of much detritus, and the eventual depletion of oxygen supplies. Such "cultural eutrophication" makes the water unusable and degrades the lake's aesthetic value (see Chapter 54).

Streams and rivers are bodies of water moving continuously in one direction (FIGURE 50.19c). At the headwaters of a stream (perhaps a spring or snowmelt), the water is often cold and clear, and it carries little sediment and relatively few mineral nutrients. The channel is usually narrow, with a swift current passing over a rocky substrate. Farther downstream, where numerous tributaries may have joined to form a river, the water may be more turbid, carrying substantially more sediment (from the erosion of soil) and nutrients. The channel near the mouth of a river is relatively wide, and the substrate is generally silty from the deposition of sediments over long periods of time.

The nutrient content of flowing water biomes is largely determined by the terrain and vegetation through which the water flows. Fallen leaves from dense, overhanging vegetation can add substantial amounts of organic matter, and the weathering of rocks can increase the concentration of inorganic nutrients. The often turbulent flow of a stream constantly oxygenates the water, whereas the sometimes murkier, warmer waters of a large river may contain relatively little oxygen. Stream- and river-dwelling animals exhibit evolutionary adaptations that enable them to resist being swept away. The smaller ones are typically flat in shape and can attach to rocks temporarily. Many arthropods live on the underside or downstream side of rocks, thereby exploiting a microhabitat that is relatively free of turbulent flow.

Many streams and rivers have been polluted by human activities. For centuries, humans have used streams and rivers as depositories of waste, thinking that these materials would be diluted and carried downstream. While some pollutants are carried far from their source, many settle to the bottom, where they can be taken up by aquatic organisms. Even the pollutants that are carried away contribute to estuary, ocean, and lake pollution. Humans have also changed flow patterns, using stream channelization to speed water flow and dams to restrain it. In many cases, dams have completely changed the downstream ecosystems, altering the intensity and volume of water flow and affecting fish and invertebrate populations (FIGURE 50.20).

This map shows only the largest of the 250 dams that have altered freshwater ecosystems throughout the Pacific Northwest. The great concrete obstacles make it difficult for salmon to swim upriver to their breeding streams, though many dams now have "fish ladders" that provide detours.

Wetlands

In the simplest sense, a wetland is an area covered with water that supports aquatic plants. In fact, wetlands range from periodically flooded regions to soil that is permanently saturated during the growing season. These conditions favor the growth of specially adapted plants called hydrophytes ("water plants"), which can grow in water or in soil that is periodically anaerobic due to the presence of water. Hydrophytes include floating pond lilies and emergent cattails, many sedges, tamarack, and black spruce. Both the hydrology and the vegetation of an area are important determinants of its classification as a wetland--a classification that can be critical when federal, state, and local governments are making preservation decisions based on rigorous, and often conflicting, definitions.

There are different types of wetlands, ranging from marshes to swamps to bogs. All these varieties, however, generally develop in one of three topographic situations. Basin wetlands develop in shallow basins, ranging from upland depressions to filled-in lakes and ponds (FIGURE 50.21a). Riverine wetlands develop along shallow and periodically flooded banks of rivers and streams. Fringe wetlands occur along the coasts of large lakes and seas, where water flows back and forth because of rising lake levels or tidal action. Thus, fringe wetlands include both freshwater and marine biomes. Marine coastal wetlands are closely linked to estuaries, which we examine shortly.

Fig 50-21. Wetlands and estuaries. (a) Wetlands. This marsh in Pennsylvania is an example of a basin wetland. Marshes are usually covered with water year-round. Predominant plants are emergent, with stems and leaves extending above the water surface; they include the pond lilies, reeds, and cattails visible in this photograph. Other kinds of wetlands include swamps (dominated by woody plants), bogs (dominated by sphagnum mosses), and seasonal pools. (b) An estuary. This view of an estuary that is part of Chesapeake Bay, in Maryland, shows the intimate association of river mouths and the marine environment into which they carry water. Unfortunately, the land surrounding Chesapeake Bay is heavily populated and industrialized, and pollution that enters the bay through four major rivers has made it unsuitable for many plant and animal species. What was once a bountiful natural source of seafood and other resources has been degraded and rendered less productive by human activity.

Ecologically, wetlands are among the richest of biomes. They contain a diverse community of invertebrates, supporting a wide variety of birds. Herbivores from crustaceans to muskrats consume algae, detritus, and plants. In addition to the rich diversity of species that is supported by wetlands, the ecological and economic value of wetlands exceeds that expected from their geographic extent alone; they provide water-storage basins that reduce the intensity of flooding, and they improve water quality by filtering pollutants. In the past, humans have often regarded wetlands as wastelands--as sources of mosquitoes, flies, and bad odors--and have destroyed many wetlands, mostly filling in with earth to provide land for agriculture and development. Both governments and private organizations are now attempting to protect remaining wetlands through acquisition, economic incentives, and regulation. A great deal of research is under way to determine how wetlands can be created or restored.

Estuaries

The area where a freshwater stream or river merges with the ocean is called an estuary; it is often bordered by extensive coastal wetlands called mudflats and salt marshes (FIGURE 50.21b). Salinity varies spatially within estuaries, from nearly that of fresh water to that of the ocean; it also varies over the course of a day with the rise and fall of the tides. Nutrients from the river enrich estuarine waters, making estuaries one of the most biologically productive biomes on Earth.

Salt marsh grasses, algae, and phytoplankton are the major producers in estuaries. This environment also supports a variety of worms, oysters, crabs, and many of the fish species that humans consume. Many marine invertebrates and fishes use estuaries as a breeding ground or migrate through them to freshwater habitats upstream. Estuaries are also crucial feeding areas for many semiaquatic vertebrates, particularly waterfowl.

Although estuaries support a wide variety of commercially valuable species, areas around estuaries are also prime locations for commercial and residential developments. In addition, estuaries are unfortunately at the receiving end for pollutants dumped upstream. Very little undisturbed estuarine habitat remains, and a large percentage has been totally eliminated by landfill and development. Many states have now--rather belatedly--taken steps to preserve their remaining estuaries.

Zonation in Marine Communities

Similar to the communities in freshwater lakes, marine communities are distributed according to depth of the water, degree of light penetration, distance from shore, and open water versus bottom (FIGURE 50.22, p. 1110). Marine communities illustrate graphically the limitations on distributions that result from these abiotic factors. There is a photic zone where phytoplankton, zooplankton, and many fish species occur, and an aphotic zone below. Because water absorbs light so well and the ocean is so deep, most of the ocean volume is virtually devoid of light, except for tiny amounts produced by a few luminescent fishes and invertebrates. The zone where land meets water is called the intertidal zone; beyond the intertidal zone is the neritic zone, the shallow regions over the continental shelves; and past the continental shelf is the oceanic zone, reaching very great depths. Finally, open water of any depth is the pelagic zone, at the bottom of which is the seafloor, or benthic zone.

Fig 50-22. Zonation in the marine environment. The marine environment can be classified on the basis of three physical criteria: light penetration (photic and aphotic zones), distance from shore and water depth (intertidal, neritic, and oceanic zones), and whether it is open water or bottom (pelagic and benthic zones). The abyssal zone is the benthic region in deep oceans. Ecologists often combine two designations, such as the oceanic pelagic zone, to identify the location of a biome.

Intertidal Zones

An intertidal zone is alternately submerged and exposed by the twice-daily cycle of tides. Intertidal communities are therefore subject to huge daily variations in the availability of seawater (and the nutrients it carries) and in temperature. Perhaps most significant of all, intertidal organisms are subject to the mechanical forces of wave action, which can dislodge them from the habitat.

The rocky intertidal zone is vertically stratified and provides excellent examples of distributional limitations over short distances (FIGURE 50.23a). Most of the organisms have structural adaptations that enable them to attach to the hard substrate in this physically tumultuous environment. On sandy substrates (beaches) or mudflats, the intertidal zone is not as clearly stratified. Wave action and tides constantly move the particles of mud and sand, and few large algae or plants occupy these habitats. Many animals, such as suspension-feeding worms and clams and predatory crustaceans, bury themselves in sand or mud, feeding when the tides bring sources of food. Other surface-dwelling organisms, such as crabs and shorebirds, are scavengers or predators on these organisms.

Fig 50-23. Examples of marine biomes. (a) Intertidal zones. This photograph of rocky intertidal zones on the Oregon coast was taken at low tide to illustrate the vertical zonation of algae and animals. The density of organisms in each of the three major zones is roughly proportional to the percentage of time the zone is submerged. Organisms in the uppermost zone--grazing mollusks, suspension-feeding barnacles, and a few algae--are submerged only during the highest tides and have numerous adaptations that prevent dehydration and overheating. The middle zone, generally submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, is inhabited by a diverse array of algae, sponges, sea anemones, mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms, and small fishes. The bottom intertidal zone is exposed only during the lowest tides. A dense cover of seaweeds in this zone often harbors a diversity of invertebrates and fishes. (b) Coral reefs. This coral reef in Fiji illustrates some of the immense variety of microorganisms, invertebrates, and fishes that live among the coral and algae, making coral reefs one of the most diverse and productive biomes on Earth. (c) Benthos: a deep-sea vent community. The species composition of benthos varies dramatically with water depth. Pictured here is a vent community, first discovered at a depth of 2,500 m in the late 1970s. These communities are found at spreading centers on the seafloor, where hot magma superheats the water. About a dozen species of prokaryotes identified near the vents are chemoautotrophic producers that obtain energy by oxidizing H2S formed by a reaction of the hot water with dissolved sulfate (SO42-). Among the animals in these communities are giant tube-dwelling worms (pictured here), some more than 1 m long. They are apparently nourished by chemo-synthetic prokaryotes that live as symbionts within the worms. Many other invertebrates, including arthropods and echinoderms, are also abundant around the vents.

Partly because of our strong attraction to the seashore, humans have had a long-term impact on intertidal ecosystems. The recreational use of ocean shores has caused a severe decline in the numbers of many beach-nesting birds and sea turtles. Incoming tides carry in polluted water and old fishing lines and plastic debris that can harm wildlife. The most dramatic intertidal pollutant is probably oil, which harms not only birds and marine mammals but also intertidal algae and invertebrates. The ultimate outcome of oil pollution in intertidal zones is reduced species diversity, with increases in the populations of a few oil-resistant species.

Coral Reefs

In warm tropical waters in the neritic zone, coral reefs constitute a conspicuous and distinctive biome. Currents and waves constantly renew nutrient supplies to the reefs, and sunlight penetrates to the ocean floor, allowing photosynthesis.

Coral reefs are dominated by the structure of the coral itself, formed by a diverse group of cnidarians that secrete hard external skeletons made of calcium carbonate (see Chapter 33). These skeletons vary in shape, forming a substrate on which other corals, sponges, and algae grow (FIGURE 50.23b). Red algae encrusted with calcium carbonate also add large amounts of limestone to most reefs, as do bryozoans. The coral animals themselves suspension-feed on microscopic organisms and particles of organic debris. They also obtain organic molecules from the photosynthesis of symbiotic dinoflagellate algae that live in their tissues. Coral animals can survive without the dinoflagellates, but their rate of calcium carbonate deposition is much slower without them; thus, reef formation by corals depends on this symbiotic association.

Some coral reefs cover enormous expanses of shallow ocean, but this delicate biome is easily degraded by pollution and development, as well as by souvenir hunters who gather the coral skeletons. High water temperatures (greater than 30&#176;C) cause corals to "bleach"--to expel their symbiotic dinoflagellates and die. In 1998, coral reefs around the world suffered moderate to severe bleaching, and there is great concern that global warming could destroy many coral reefs. Corals are also subject to damage from native and introduced predators, such as the crown-of-thorns sea star, which has undergone a population explosion in many regions and destroyed a number of coral reefs in parts of the western Pacific Ocean. Reef communities are very old and grow very slowly; they may not be able to withstand continued human encroachment and dramatic climate changes.

The Oceanic Pelagic Biome

Most of the ocean's water lies far from shore in the oceanic pelagic biome, constantly mixed by ocean currents. Nutrient concentrations are generally lower in the open ocean than in coastal areas because the remains of plankton and other organisms sink below the photic region into the dark, lower benthic zone. In some tropical areas, surface waters are lower in nutrients than the surface waters of temperate oceans because a year-round thermal stratification prevents an exchange of nutrients between the surface and the deep. Temperate oceans generally are more productive, because, like temperate lakes, they experience a nutrient turnover in the spring and, to a limited extent, in the fall. The springtime recirculation of nutrients from the depths stimulates a surge of photosynthetic plankton growth.

Photosynthetic plankton grow and reproduce rapidly in the photic region of the oceanic biome. Modern sampling methods, which take bacterial photosynthesis into account, show that the plankton's rate of organic food production is higher than formerly thought. Nonetheless, photosynthetic plankton account for less than half the photosynthetic activity on Earth. Zooplankton, including protozoans, worms, copepods, shrimplike krill, jellies, and the small larvae of invertebrates and fishes, graze on the photosynthetic plankton. Most plankton exhibit morphological structures, such as bubble-trapping spines, lipid droplets, gelatinous capsules, and air bladders, that help them stay within the photic zone.

The oceanic pelagic biome also includes free-swimming animals, called nekton, that can move against the currents to locate food. Examples of nekton are large squids, fishes, sea turtles, and marine mammals. These animals feed either on plankton or on each other. Although many of these animals feed in the photic region of the pelagic zone, others live at great depths, where fish may have enlarged eyes, enabling them to see in the very dim light, and luminescent organs that attract mates and prey. Many pelagic birds, such as petrels, terns, albatrosses, and boobies, catch fish in the surface waters.

Benthos

The ocean bottom below the neritic and pelagic zones is the benthic zone, as in other aquatic biomes. Nutrients reach the seafloor from the waters above by "raining down" in the form of detritus. Although the benthic zone in shallow, near-coastal waters may receive substantial sunlight, light and temperature decline dramatically with depth.

Neritic benthic communities are extremely productive, consisting of bacteria, fungi, seaweeds and filamentous algae, numerous invertebrates, and fishes. Species composition of these communities varies with distance from the shore, water depth, and composition of the bottom.

Organisms in the very deep benthic communities, or abyssal zone, are adapted to continuous cold (about 3&#176;C), extremely high water pressure, near or total absence of light, and low nutrient concentrations. However, oxygen is usually present in abyssal waters, and a fairly diverse community of invertebrates and fishes occupies this region. Marine scientists have also discovered a unique assemblage of organisms associated with deep-sea hydrothermal vents of volcanic origin in midocean ridges (FIGURE 50.23c). In this dark, hot, oxygen-deficient environment, the food producers are not photosynthesizing organisms but chemoautotrophic prokaryotes (see Chapter 27). The organic molecules they synthesize support a food chain that includes giant polychaete worms, arthropods, echinoderms, and fishes.





 The geographic distribution of terrestrial biomes is based mainly on regional variations in climate

All the abiotic factors we covered earlier in the chapter, but especially climate, are important in determining why a particular terrestrial biome is found in a certain area. Because there are latitudinal patterns of climate over Earth's surface (see FIGURES 50.11-50.13), there are also latitudinal patterns of biome distribution. For example, coniferous forests extend in a broad band across North America, Europe, and Asia (FIGURE 50.24).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 50-24. The distribution of major terrestrial biomes. Although terrestrial biomes are mapped here with sharp boundaries, biomes actually grade into one another, sometimes over relatively large areas. The tropics are the low-latitude regions bordered by the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.

Terrestrial biomes are often named for major physical or climatic features and for their predominant vegetation. For example, temperate grasslands are dominated by various grass species and are generally found in middle latitudes, where the climate is more moderate than in the tropics or polar regions. Each biome is also characterized by microorganisms, fungi, and animals adapted to that particular environment. Temperate grasslands, for example, are more likely than forests to be populated by large grazing mammals.

Vertical stratification is an important feature of terrestrial biomes, and the shapes and sizes of plants largely define the layering. For example, in many forests, the layers consist of the upper canopy, then the low-tree stratum, the shrub understory, the ground layer of herbaceous plants, the forest floor (litter layer), and finally the root layer. Other (nonforest) biomes have similar, though usually less pronounced vertical strata. For instance, grasslands have a canopy formed by an herbaceous layer of grass species, a litter layer, and a root layer. The root layer in arctic tundra is shallower than in most other biomes because a permanently frozen stratum called permafrost underlies it.

Vertical stratification of a biome's vegetation provides many different habitats for animals, which often occupy well-defined feeding groups, from the insectivorous and carnivorous birds and bats that feed above canopies to the small mammals, numerous worms, and arthropods that forage the litter and root layers for food.

Terrestrial biomes usually grade into each other, without sharp boundaries. The area of intergradation may be wide or narrow and is called an ecotone.

The actual species composition of any one kind of biome varies from one location to another. For instance, in the northern coniferous forest (taiga) of North America, red spruce is common in the east but does not occur in most other areas, where black spruce and white spruce are abundant. Although the vegetation of African deserts superficially resembles that of North American deserts, the plants are in different families. Such "ecological equivalents" can arise because of convergent evolution (see Chapter 25).

Biomes are dynamic, and natural disturbance rather than stability tends to be the rule. As a result of disturbance, biomes usually exhibit extensive patchiness, with several communities represented in any particular area. Hurricanes create openings in tropical and temperate forests. In northern coniferous forests, old trees die and fall over, or snowfall may break branches and small trees, producing openings or gaps that allow deciduous species, such as aspen and birch, to grow. In many biomes, even the dominant plants depend on periodic disturbance. For example, fire is an integral component of grasslands, savannas, chaparral, and many coniferous forests. Before agricultural and urban development, much of the southeastern United States was dominated by a single conifer species, the longleaf pine. Without periodic burning, deciduous trees tended to replace the pines. Forest managers now use fire as a tool to help maintain many coniferous forests.

In many biomes today, extensive human activities have radically altered the natural patterns of periodic physical disturbance. Most of the eastern United States, for example, is classified as temperate deciduous forest, but human activity has eliminated all but a tiny percentage of the original forest. Fires, which used to be part of life on the Great Plains, are now controlled for the sake of agricultural land use. Humans have altered much of Earth's surface, replacing original biomes with urban and agricultural ones.

Fig 50-25. Examples of terrestrial biomes. (a) Tropical forest. The photograph shows a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. Tropical rain forests have pronounced vertical stratification. Trees in the canopy make up the topmost stratum. The canopy is often closed, so that little light reaches the ground below. When an opening does occur, perhaps because of a fallen tree, other trees and large woody vines grow rapidly, competing for light and space as they fill the gap. Many of the trees are covered with epiphytes (plants that grow on other plants rather than in soil), such as orchids and bromeliads. Rainfall, which varies from region to region in the tropics, is the prime determinant of the vegetation growing in an area. In lowland areas that have a prolonged dry season or scarce rainfall at any time, tropical dry forests predominate. The plants found there are a mixture of thorny shrubs and trees and succulents. In regions with distinct wet and dry seasons, tropical deciduous trees are common. (b) Savanna. This Kenyan savanna is a showcase of large herbivores and their predators. Actually, the dominant herbivores here and in other savannas are insects, especially ants and termites. Grasses and scattered trees are the dominant plants. Fire is an important abiotic component, and the dominant plant species are fire adapted. The luxuriant growth of grasses and forbs (small broadleaf plants) during the rainy season provides a rich food source for animals. However, large grazing mammals must migrate to greener pastures and scattered watering holes during regular periods of seasonal drought. (c) Desert. Sparse rainfall (less than 30 cm per year) largely determines that an area will be a desert. Some deserts have soil surface temperatures above 60&#176;C during the day. Other deserts, such as those west of the Rocky Mountains and in central Asia, are relatively cold. The Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona (shown here) is characterized by giant saguaro cacti and deeply rooted shrubs. Evolutionary adaptations of desert plants and animals include a remarkable array of mechanisms that store water. The "pleated" structure of saguaro cacti enables the plants to expand when they absorb water during wet periods. Some desert mice never drink, deriving all their water from the metabolic breakdown of the seeds they eat. Many desert plants also rely on CAM photosynthesis, a metabolic adaptation that conserves water in this arid environment (see Chapter 10). Protective adaptations that deter feeding by mammals and insects, such as spines on cacti and poisons in the leaves of shrubs, are also common in desert plants. (d) Chaparral. Dense, spiny, evergreen shrubs dominate chaparral biomes, midlatitude coastal areas with mild, rainy winters and long, hot, dry summers. Plants of the chaparral, such as those in this California scrubland, are adapted to and dependent on periodic fires. The dry, woody shrubs are frequently ignited by lightning and by careless human activities, creating summer and autumn brushfires in the densely populated canyons of southern California and elsewhere. Some of the shrubs produce seeds that will germinate only after a hot fire. Food reserves stored in their fire-resistant roots enable them to resprout quickly and use nutrients released by fires. (e) Temperate grassland. The veldts of South Africa, the puszta of Hungary, the pampas of Argentina and Uruguay, the steppes of Russia, and the plains and prairies of central North America are all temperate grasslands. The key to the persistence of grasslands is seasonal drought, occasional fires, and grazing by large mammals, all of which prevent establishment of woody shrubs and trees. Temperate grasslands, such as the tallgrass prairie in Kansas (shown here), once covered much of central North America. Because grassland soil is both deep and rich in nutrients, these habitats provide fertile land for agriculture. Most grassland in the United States has been converted to farmland, and very little natural prairie exists today. (f) Temperate deciduous forest. Dense stands of deciduous trees are the trademark of temperate deciduous forests, such as this one in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina. Temperate deciduous forests occur throughout midlatitudes where there is sufficient moisture to support the growth of large trees. More open than rain forests and not as tall, a mature temperate deciduous forest has distinct vertical layers, including one or two strata of trees, an understory of shrubs, and an herbaceous stratum. Deciduous forest trees drop their leaves before winter, when temperatures are too low for effective photosynthesis and water lost through transpiration is not easily replaced from frozen soil. Many temperate deciduous forest mammals also enter a dormant winter state called hibernation, and some bird species migrate to warmer climates. Virtually all the original deciduous forests in North America were destroyed by logging and land clearing for agriculture and urban development. In contrast to drier biomes, these forests tend to recover after disturbance, and today we see deciduous trees dominating undeveloped areas over much of their former range. (g) Coniferous forest. Cone-bearing trees, such as pine, spruce, fir, and hemlock, dominate coniferous forests. Coastal coniferous forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, such as the one shown here in Olympic National Park in western Washington, are actually temperate rain forests. Warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean supports these unique communities, which like most coniferous forests are dominated by one or a few tree species. Extending in a broad band across northern North America and Eurasia to the southern border of the arctic tundra, the northern coniferous forest, or taiga, is the largest terrestrial biome on Earth (see FIGURE 50.24). Taiga receives heavy snowfall during winter. The conical shape of many conifers prevents too much snow from accumulating on and breaking their branches. Coniferous forests are being logged at an alarming rate, and the old-growth stands of these trees may soon disappear. (h) Tundra. Permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil), bitterly cold temperatures, and high winds are responsible for the absence of trees and other tall plants in this arctic tundra in central Alaska (photographed in autumn). Although the arctic tundra receives very little annual rainfall (see FIGURE 50.10), water cannot penetrate the underlying permafrost and accumulates in pools on the shallow topsoil during the short summer. Tundra covers expansive areas of the Arctic, amounting to 20%  of Earth's land surface. High winds and cold temperatures create similar plant communities, called alpine tundra, on very high mountaintops at all latitudes, including the tropics.





 Different factors may determine the distribution of a species on different scales

FIGURE 50.26 (p. 1118) illustrates the problem of describing a species' geographic range on different scales. At one extreme, the range of a species is defined by the worldwide extent of occurrence, a line drawn on a map around the outermost points at which the species has been observed. This is the definition of geographic range used in bird field guides and other natural history guidebooks. At the other extreme, we could measure a much smaller area within the larger geographic range and map the location of each individual. If a particular habitat is not occupied by the species, this region would not be included in its geographic range. Ecologists would like to know the actual areas occupied by each species throughout its range, but such detailed data are not available for most organisms. The important point of FIGURE 50.26 is that we can measure geographic ranges on several spatial scales and that even for a single species, there may be several answers to the question: What limits geographic distribution? Abiotic influences, such as climate, are paramount on the global scale. However, at the local level, more subtle biotic interactions, such as symbiosis, may be the major explanation for why a species occurs in one locale and not another.

Fig 50-26. A hierarchy of scales for analyzing the geographic distribution of the moss Tetraphis. The question: What limits geographic distribution? There may be different answers, depending on the scale of our analysis.





 Most species have small geographic ranges

Most species in all taxonomic groups have small geographic ranges; only a small minority of species are widespread. FIGURE 50.27 illustrates this for North American birds and British vascular plants. Ecologists do not know the reason for this pattern, even though it occurs in plants and animals, in aquatic and terrestrial groups, in invertebrates and vertebrates. This pattern of small ranges is related to the observation that most species are relatively rare in nature, and only common organisms tend to have widespread geographic ranges. But this observation simply begs the question: Why are some organisms rare and others common? To explain these patterns of life in the biosphere is one of the research challenges ecologists face. In Chapters 52 and 53, we'll examine how ecologists are trying to answer such questions about abundance and distribution in the biosphere. And throughout this ecology unit, we'll see the impact that we humans, by far the most abundant and widely distributed of all large animals, are having on the entire biosphere.

The study of animal behavior is undoubtedly one of the oldest branches of biology. Tens of thousands of years ago, behavioral knowledge was essential to human survival. By learning the habits of the animals around them, early humans increased their chances of securing a meal and decreased their chances of becoming a meal. Thus, our ancestors' awareness of animal behavior ultimately enhanced their Darwinian fitness. More generally, our own behavior, as well as that of other animals, has its ultimate basis in evolution.

Consider the male magnolia warbler in the photograph on this page. To our ears, his song is a musical "weete, weete, weetchew," with the last note slurring upward. However, as one experienced birder is fond of telling novices, "It's not music to a bird's ears. Birds sing for practical reasons--to attract mates, to let other males or females know where they are, to hold a territory where they can raise and feed their young. For birds, singing is about survival and passing genes to the next generation."

Bird song provides an excellent introduction to the subject of behavior. For one thing, bird song is amenable to modern experimental methods. As a result, biologists are beginning to understand a great deal about development, functions, and consequences of bird song. Bird song is also attractive to researchers because of several striking parallels between bird song and human speech. It has also become a model system for animal behavior research because it demonstrates a very important generalization: Behavior is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The study of bird song has provided guideposts for the study of other complex behaviors that are less understood.

Studying an animal's behavior is essential to understanding the animal's evolution and ecological interactions. This chapter emphasizes the nature of animal behavior, how biologists study it, and the function of behavior in the relationship between an animal and its environment.

What does an animal's brain do with the information it obtains about the outside world? If a chimpanzee is placed in an area with a banana hung high out of reach and several boxes on the floor, the chimp can "size up" the situation and stack the boxes, enabling it to reach the food. Such novel problem-solving behavior is highly developed in some mammals, especially primates and dolphins, and notable examples have also been observed in some bird species, especially crows, ravens, and jays. Ravens, for example, exhibit marked individual variation in their attempts to solve some of the problems imposed on them by experimenters (FIGURE 51.13).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-13. Problem solving. Behavioral biologist Bernd Heinrich placed ravens in an experimental situation in which they had to solve the problem of obtaining food hanging from a string. The raven shown here solved the problem by using one foot to pull the string in increments and the other foot to secure the string so the food didn't just drop again. Of interest was the tremendous individual variation in behavior that Heinrich observed. Some ravens never learned to get at the food, while others solved the problem in different ways.

Watching an animal solve a problem makes us aware that its nervous system has a substantial ability to process information. An expanding research effort on animal cognition seeks to understand information processing at all levels, from the nervous system activities that underlie sophisticated behavior, such as problem solving, to the internal representations animals have about physical objects in their surroundings.

 What is behavior?

Most of what we call behavior consists of an animal's muscular activity that is externally visible. In some cases, it is the whole body that moves, as when a predator chases its prey. In other cases, the behavior is a movement of a body part, even though the animal stays in place, as when we signal a direction by extending our arm and pointing a finger. There are also examples of behavior in which muscular activity is less obvious, as when a bird sings by using muscles to force air from its lungs and shape the sounds in its throat. And there are even some nonmuscular activities that count as behavior, as when an animal secretes a sex attractant. Finally, we might include learning as a behavioral process, even when any observable behavior it produces occurs only later. For example, a young bird may memorize a song that it hears an adult of its species singing. But the first observable muscular activity based on this memory may not occur until months later, when the bird begins to sing the song for itself. Thus, in addition to studying observable behaviors, mainly in the form of muscle-powered activities, behavioral biologists also study the mechanisms underlying those behaviors, which may not involve muscles at all. Put another way, we can think of behavior as what an animal does and how it does it, a definition broad enough to include nonmotor components of behavior such as learning and memory.





 Behavior has both proximate and ultimate causes

When we observe a certain behavior, we are apt to ask both proximate and ultimate questions. In the study of animal behavior, proximate questions are mechanistic, concerned with the environmental stimuli, if any, that trigger a behavior, as well as the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying a behavioral act. Ultimate questions address the evolutionary significance of a behavior. To emphasize the distinction (and also the connection) between proximate and ultimate causation, consider the observation that the magnolia warbler, like many animals, breeds in spring and early summer. In terms of proximate causation, a reasonable hypothesis is that breeding is triggered by the effect of increased day length on an animal's photoreceptors. Many animals can be stimulated to begin breeding by experimentally lengthening their daily exposure to light. This stimulus results in neural and hormonal changes that induce behavior associated with reproduction, such as singing and nest building in birds.

In contrast to proximate questions, ultimate questions take such forms as, Why did natural selection favor this behavior and not a different one? Hypotheses addressing "why" questions propose that the behavior maximizes fitness in some particular way. A reasonable hypothesis for why many animals reproduce in spring and early summer is that this is when breeding is most productive or adaptive. For warblers and many other birds, an abundant supply of insects in the spring provides ample food for rapidly growing offspring. Individuals that attempt to breed at other times would be at a selective disadvantage. Increased day length itself has little adaptive significance, but since it is the most reliable indicator of time of year, there has been selection for a proximate mechanism that depends on increased day length. In brief, proximate mechanisms produce behaviors that ultimately evolved because they reflect Darwinian fitness in some particular way. Behavioral biologists also use the comparative methods of phylogenetic biology (see Chapter 25) to formulate hypotheses about the evolution of behavior. Phylogenetic trees based on molecular, morphological, or behavioral data and illustrating the most likely evolutionary history of a closely related group of species enable researchers to estimate when a particular behavior arose in a lineage, whether it arose once or repeatedly, and which kinds of behavior occurred in ancestors.





 Behavior results from both genes and environmental factors

A myth that is still perpetuated by the popular media is that behavior is due either to genes (nature) or to environmental influences (nurture). In biology, however, the nature-versus-nurture issue is not about either/or; it is about how both the genes and the environment influence the development of phenotypes, including behavioral phenotypes. If we consider the development of any behavioral trait, we find a series of environmental and genetic influences. As we discussed in Chapter 14, phenotype depends on both genes and the environment; behavioral traits have genetic and environmental components, as do all of an animal's anatomical and physiological features.

Thus, we can move from the question of whether behavior is genetic or environmental to ask how different factors influence a particular behavior. One approach to the question is in terms of the norm of reaction (see Chapter 14); we measure, for a particular genotype, what behavioral phenotypes develop in a range of environments. In some cases, much the same behavior develops in all environments; in other cases, the behavior is variable, depending on the environmental experience. It takes thorough research on each case to describe the genetic and environmental influences, as the case study in FIGURE 51.1 illustrates.

Fig 51-1. Genetic and environmental components of behavior: a case study.

In a few cases, researchers have been able to link behaviors to specific genes. For instance, Marla Sokolowski, of Toronto University, studied a genetic polymorphism in a gene called dg2 in fruit flies (Drosophila). The gene influences the level of a protein that functions in signaling within cells. One allele of dg2 causes a relatively low level of the protein. This results in a behavioral phenotype called "sitter," in which the fly moves less than average. A different allele causes a higher level of the protein and a "rover" behavioral phenotype, in which the fly moves about more than average. In this example, a simple difference in one gene changes the behavioral phenotype. However, a complete account of the development of movement patterns in flies would require a look at many more genes in addition to dg2. The dg2 gene interacts with other genes, and environmental conditions are also influential. Most behavioral traits are polygenic, with environmental variables producing broad norms of reaction.

So what do the media reports of newly discovered genes for complex human behavioral traits, such as depression, violence, or alcoholism, really mean? According to Robert Plomin, director of the Center for Developmental and Health Genetics at Pennsylvania State University, research into the heritability of behavior is the best demonstration of the importance of environment. As Plomin puts it, genes and nongenetic environmental factors "build on each other."

The environmental factors that affect behavior are all conditions in which the genes underlying behavior are expressed. This includes the chemical environment within cells, as well as all the hormonal and other chemical and physical conditions experienced by a developing animal within an egg or womb. It also includes the multiple interactions among components of an animal's nervous system and effectors, as well as the varied chemical, visual, auditory, or tactile interactions with other organisms.





 Innate behavior is developmentally fixed

If behavior has both genetic and environmental underpinnings, what do we mean when we say a particular behavior is innate? For example, newly hatched, still-blind birds of many species beg for food by raising their heads, opening their mouths, and cheeping loudly when a parent lands on the side of the nest. This behavior is often attributed to genetic programming without any environmental influence. However, it is imprecise to say that any behavior is due solely to genes. All genes, including those whose expression underlies innate behavior, require an environment (a physical body) to be expressed. The key point about innate behavior is that the range of environmental differences among individuals does not appear to alter the behavior. Although usage of the term innate varies, in behavioral biology it refers to behavior that is developmentally fixed; all individuals exhibit virtually the same behavior despite the inevitable environmental differences within and outside their bodies during development and throughout life.

How did innate behavior evolve? Performing certain behaviors automatically, without having any specific experience, may have maximized fitness to the point that genes for variant behavior were lost. For example, there are some things that a young animal has to get right on the first try if it is to stay alive. Kittiwakes are gulls that nest on cliff ledges. Uniquely among gull species, kittiwakes show an innate aversion to cliff edges; they turn away from the edge. Kittiwake chicks in earlier generations that did not show the edge-aversion response failed to become ancestors to modern kittiwakes.





 Classical ethology presaged an evolutionary approach to behavioral biology

Modern behavioral biology has its roots in a research field known as ethology, which originated in the 1930s with naturalists who tried to understand how a variety of animals behave in their natural habitats (FIGURE 51.2). Foremost among these naturalists were Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz, and Niko Tinbergen, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1973 for their discoveries. How animals can carry out many behaviors without ever having seen them performed was one of the major subjects of early ethological research. Ethologists focused on proximate mechanisms, but with an eye toward the genetic links to behavior and the adaptive nature of behavior, an orientation that helped connect behavioral biology with evolution and ecology.

Early ethologists developed the concept of a fixed action pattern (FAP), a sequence of behavioral acts that is essentially unchangeable and usually carried to completion once initiated. A FAP is triggered by an external sensory stimulus known as a sign stimulus. In many cases, the sign stimulus is some feature of another species. For example, some moths instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground in response to the ultrasonic signals sent out by predatory bats (see the introduction to Chapter 49). The ultrasonic signals are the cue that triggers avoidance behavior in the moths.

A classic case of sign stimuli and FAPs is seen in the male three-spined stickleback fish, which attacks other males that invade his territory. The stimulus for the attack behavior is the red belly of the intruder. The stickleback will not attack an invading fish lacking a red underside, but will readily attack nonfishlike models as long as some red is present (FIGURE 51.3). Tinbergen, who first reported these findings, was inspired to look into the matter by his casual observation that his fish responded aggressively when a red truck passed their tank. As it turns out, red coloration of body parts tends to trigger either aggressive or sexual behavior in many species that have color vision.

Fig 51-3. Classic demonstration of innate behavior. Aggression in a male three-spined stickleback fish is triggered by a simple visual cue. The realistic model at the top without a red underside produces no response. All the others produce strong responses because they have the required red underside.

Classic experiments on FAPs and sign stimuli have shown that many animals tend to use a relatively limited subset of the sensory information available to them and to behave stereotypically in many situations. In contrast, humans often tend to respond to an entire situation, and we generally base our actions on more diverse information. If a stickleback processed information like a human, it would realize that the models in FIGURE 51.3 are not real fish, despite their red bellies. Actually, relatively simple, stereotypical behaviors seem to occur in all animals, including humans. Human infants grasp strongly with their hands in response to a tactile stimulus. An infant's smile could also be considered a FAP; it is readily induced by simple stimuli, such as a sound or a figure consisting of two dark spots on a white circle, a kind of rudimentary representation of a face.

A sign stimulus is a key feature in an animal's environment, leading the animal to respond quickly and appropriately. However, because the animal responds to the sign rather than to the whole environmental context, the animal can often be tricked into inappropriate behavior, as in the stickleback's response to the models in FIGURE 51.3. In some cases, such misdirected responses can be detrimental. For example, mayflies swarm and mate above water, and females then deposit their eggs on the water surface. The breeding mayflies detect a water surface by the polarization pattern of the light reflected from it. Unfortunately, roads can produce a similar polarization pattern in reflected light, and mayflies now often lay their eggs on roads, where the eggs perish (FIGURE 51.4). Many mayfly species are endangered, and their behavioral mechanism for detecting water may drive them to extinction in environments where roads are becoming more abundant than standing water. Given the potential of sign stimuli to mislead animals into maladaptive behavior, we might ask why animals use them at all. Some ethologists have suggested that FAPs triggered by simple cues prevent an animal from wasting time processing or integrating a wide variety of inputs.

Fig 51-4. Mayflies laying eggs on human-made surfaces. Mayflies normally lay their eggs on water, but the pattern of polarized light that they use to find water is also produced by reflections from black plastic sheets and roads. (a) Female mayfly ovipositing (egg-laying) on black plastic sheet used in agriculture (b) Male mayfly attracted to a dry asphalt road

Although some simple behavior patterns can be understood in terms of sign stimuli and fixed action patterns, the concept is too simplistic to account for much of animal behavior. Though historically important in the development of behavioral biology, sign stimuli and fixed action patterns are not major focuses of behavioral research today.





 Behavioral ecology emphasizes evolutionary hypotheses

Evolution is the core theme of biology, and the study of behavior in an ecological context emphasizes evolutionary (ultimate) explanations. Behavioral ecology is the research field that views behavior as an evolutionary adaptation to the natural ecological conditions of animals. Natural selection will favor behavioral patterns that enhance survival and reproductive success. Thus, an animal showing optimal behavior maximizes its reproductive fitness. However, most animal behavior is less than optimal; for instance, environmental change or constraints on an animal's sensory powers may result in suboptimal behavior. Therefore, although we can expect animal behavior to be well adapted, it may not be optimally adapted.

In the remainder of this section, we will explore some examples of research in behavioral ecology.

Songbird Repertoires

Many songbirds have a repertoire of song types. Some of these songs sound identical to us but can be easily distinguished when analyzed with an instrument called a sound spectrograph (FIGURE 51.5). Why has natural selection favored this multisong behavior over the expert vocalization of a single tune?



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-5. The repertoire of a songbird. These sonograms, or "voiceprints," show a graph of a sound's frequency (perceived as pitch) versus time. Four distinct song types of one male brown-headed cowbird are illustrated. Individual cowbirds generally have three to six song types, but other species have dozens or even hundreds of types.

Following the approach of behavioral ecology, you could formulate several testable hypotheses, all starting with "A repertoire increases fitness because&#160;...&#160;" You might postulate that a repertoire increases fitness because it makes an older, more experienced male more attractive to females. For this hypothesis to be true, it must be the case that (1) males learn more song types as they get older, making repertoire size a reliable indicator of age, and (2) females prefer to mate with males having large repertoires. Thus, your hypothesis makes two clearly testable predictions.

To test the first prediction, you can determine whether there is a correlation between a male's age and the size of his song repertoire. If there is not, your hypothesis will be invalidated, which would be informative although perhaps disappointing. As it turns out, some songbird species show this correlation, while others do not. Next, you can determine whether females are more sexually stimulated by a large song repertoire than by a small one. This can be done by playing tape-recorded male songs to females that have been made especially receptive by the temporary administration of a female hormone. Such females indicate their song preferences by assuming a copulatory posture, even though there is no male around. FIGURE 51.6 shows another way to assess female responses. All this work may lead to an evolutionary explanation: Large bird-song repertoires result in females mating more often or earlier in the season with experienced males, who will give their offspring a better chance to survive.

Fig 51-6. Female warblers prefer males with large song repertoires. Male sedge warblers with large repertoires attract females to pair with them earlier in the breeding season, as well as more often, than males with small repertoires. Males with large repertoires, as well as the females that prefer large repertoires, benefit from pairing early because breeding early tends to be more successful than breeding late in the season.

Now suppose you did not use evolutionary principles to guide your research on song repertoires. Without an approach that generates testable hypotheses and predictions, you would probably record observations of numerous aspects of singing behavior. Although these efforts may produce interesting data, they would not explain the behavior. Alternatively, you might hypothesize that repertoires have nothing to do with fitness, but that male birds simply find variety more pleasurable than singing the same boring song over and over again. The method for testing such a hypothesis would not be clear, emphasizing again how much more productive it is to use evolutionary principles as a guide to behavioral research.

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Foraging Behavior

Because adequate nutrition is so essential to an animal's survival and reproductive success, we should expect natural selection to refine behaviors that enhance the efficiency of feeding. Food-obtaining behavior includes not only eating, but also any mechanisms an animal uses to recognize, search for, and capture food items. The term foraging encompasses this full set of behaviors. Optimal foraging theory views foraging behavior as a compromise between feeding costs and feeding benefits. How do foraging behaviors balance the benefits of nutrition against the costs of obtaining food? Some behavioral ecologists are applying cost-benefit analysis to study the proximate and ultimate causes of diverse foraging strategies.

Reto Zach, of the University of British Columbia, conducted a classic cost-benefit analysis of feeding behavior in crows of the Pacific Northwest. Crows are opportunistic feeders that avail themselves of a variety of food items. On Mandarte Island, off British Columbia, crows search the rocky tide pools for gastropod mollusks called whelks. The bird grasps its prey in its beak, then flies upward and drops the whelk onto the rocks to break the shell. If successful, the crow can dine on the mollusk's soft parts. If the shell doesn't break, the crow flies up and drops the shell again and again until the shell breaks. Of course, the higher the bird flies before dropping a whelk, the fewer the number of drops required to break the shell. But there is an energy cost correlated with the height of the crow's ascent. Zach predicted that crows would, on average, fly to a height that would provide the most food relative to the amount of total energy required to break the whelk shells. To determine the optimal height, Zach erected a 15 m pole and then dropped shells of relatively uniform size onto rocks from different heights along the pole. He then tabulated the data and calculated the average total effort required to break shells by dropping them from different heights:

Height of Drops (m)Average Number of Drops Required to Break ShellTotal Flight Height (Number of Drops &#160;X&#160; Height per Drop)255110313395630753515460Note that a height of about 5 m is optimal for breaking shells with the least amount of work. Although dropping the shells from 7 or 15 m resulted in breakage with fewer drops, that advantage was small compared with the effort it would take to fly that high. When Zach measured the average flight height for crows in their whelk-eating behavior, it was 5.23 m, very close to the prediction based on an optimal trade-off between energy gained (food) versus energy expended.

The feeding behavior of the bluegill sunfish provides further support for optimal foraging theory. These animals feed on small crustaceans called Daphnia, generally selecting larger individuals, which supply the most energy. However, smaller prey will be selected if larger prey are too far away (FIGURE 51.7a, p. 1128). The optimal foraging approach predicts that the proportion of small to large prey eaten will also vary with the overall density of prey. At very low prey densities, bluegill sunfish should exhibit little size selectivity, because all the prey encountered are needed to meet energy requirements. At higher prey densities, it is more efficient to concentrate on larger crustaceans. In actual experiments, bluegill sunfish did become more selective at higher prey densities, though not to the extent that would theoretically maximize efficiency (FIGURE 51.7b). Young bluegill sunfish forage fairly efficiently, but not as close to the optimum as older individuals, who are apparently able to make more complex distinctions. It may be that younger fish judge size and distance less accurately because their vision is not yet completely developed; learning may also be involved.

Behavioral ecologists recognize that energy costs and benefits are not the only factors affecting foraging behavior. Animals require not only calories, but also essential nutrients, and this, too, affects an animal's choices of food items. Moreover, foraging behavior tends to minimize the risk of the predator becoming the prey while foraging. As the following example shows, there is more to analyzing foraging behavior than weighing energy costs versus energy benefits.

The smallmouth bass readily consumes both minnows and crayfish. The fact that it does not show an overall preference suggests that the trade-offs balance, with minnows being the optimal prey in some situations and crayfish in others. Minnows contain more usable energy per unit weight (the crayfish has a lot of hard-to-digest exoskeleton), but they may require a greater energy expenditure to pursue. However, even though crayfish may be easier to catch, their large claws and aggressive resistance make them harder to subdue. Trade-offs also include the relative abundance and size of each type of prey. The brain of the smallmouth bass is somehow able to integrate all the relevant variables and formulate responses resulting in a highly efficient foraging behavior that involves switching between minnows and crayfish as conditions change. The proximate mechanisms responsible for this process are not known, but we might predict that they include specific cues that trigger innate as well as mainly experience-based behavior, to which we turn next.





 Learning is experience-based modification of behavior

Analyzing the genetic and environmental underpinnings of behavior can help scientists understand the extent to which behavior can vary among individuals of a species. In this section, we examine various forms of learning, which is the modification of behavior resulting from specific experiences. As we have said, even though an animal need not witness a developmentally fixed (innate) behavior to perform it, experience is still involved. Most innate behaviors improve with performance as animals learn to carry them out more efficiently. Conversely, it might seem that some things, such as the different human languages, are completely learned. It is true that the ability to speak a specific language, such as English or Spanish, has little or no genetic basis. However, the ability to learn a language is a function of a complex brain that develops in a particular environmental context under the guidance of a human genome.

The alarm calls of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) provide an example of how animals improve their performance of a behavior by means of learning. Dorothy Cheney and Richard Seyfarth, of the University of Pennsylvania, studied vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. The vervets there give distinct alarm calls when they see leopards, eagles, or snakes. When a vervet sees a leopard, it gives a loud barking sound; when it sees an eagle, it gives a short double-syllabled cough; and the snake alarm call is a "chutter." Leopards, eagles, and snakes all eat vervet monkeys, which are about the size of domestic cats. Upon hearing a particular alarm call, the other members of the vervet group behave in an appropriate way: They run up a tree on hearing the alarm call for a leopard (vervets are nimbler than leopards in the trees); look up on hearing the alarm call for an eagle; and look down on hearing the alarm call for a snake (FIGURE 51.8).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-8. Vervet monkeys learn correct use of alarm calls. Vervet monkeys give different alarm calls on seeing different sources of danger. For example, on seeing a python, vervets give a distinct "snake" alarm call (inset), and the members of the group stand upright and look down. Vervets probably learn when to use appropriate calls from the behavior of other members of their group.

Infant vervet monkeys give alarm calls, but in a relatively undiscriminating way. For example, they give the "eagle" alarm call on seeing any bird, including harmless birds such as bee-eaters. With age, the monkeys improve their accuracy. In fact, adult vervet monkeys give the eagle alarm only on seeing an eagle belonging to either of the two species that eat vervets. The mechanism by which infants learn how to give the right call probably includes experiencing the behavior of other members of the group. For instance, if the infant gives the call on the right occasion--an eagle alarm when there is an eagle overhead, for example--another member of the group will also give the eagle call almost immediately. But if the infant gives the call when there is only a bee-eater flying by, the adults in the group are silent. The social confirmation of the infant's call probably helps it to learn when to give each call. Thus, vervet monkeys have an initial, unlearned tendency to give calls on seeing potentially threatening objects in the environment. Learning then fine-tunes the call such that adults only give calls in response to genuine dangers.

Learning Versus Maturation

Learning often affects innate (developmentally fixed) behavior, but changes in innate behaviors are not always due to learning. For instance, behavior may change because of ongoing developmental changes in neuromuscular systems, a process called maturation. We commonly speak of birds "learning" to fly, and you may have seen fledgling birds awkwardly fluttering about as if they were practicing. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in restrictive devices so that they could never flap their wings until an age when their normal kin were already flying. Such birds flew immediately and normally when released. Thus, the improvement must have resulted from neuromuscular maturation, not from learning.

In many cases, the distinction between learning and maturation is less obvious. When an adult herring gull brings food to its chick, the adult bends its head down and moves its beak, which has a red spot. The chick pecks the beak, stimulating the adult to regurgitate the food. Experiments have shown that the red spot swung horizontally at the end of a beak is the signal that elicits the chick's pecking. However, newly hatched chicks are indiscriminate and will peck at a wide variety of objects, whereas chicks a week or two old show their strongest response to accurate models of their parents' beaks. Would you predict that this change in the chick's behavior results from maturation or learning? Experiments involving herring gulls and laughing gulls show that maturation is not involved. A laughing gull chick that has been reared by a herring gull will respond more strongly to its foster parent's beak type than to the beak of its own species. The reverse is true for a herring gull chick cross-fostered by laughing gulls. This is an example of how learning can modify a behavior that is basically developmentally fixed.

Habituation

Habituation is a very simple type of learning that involves a loss of responsiveness to stimuli that convey little or no information. Examples are widespread. A hydra contracts when disturbed by a slight touch; it stops responding, however, if disturbed repeatedly by such a stimulus. Many mammals and birds recognize alarm calls of members of their species, but they eventually stop responding if these calls are not followed by an actual attack (the "cry-wolf" effect). In terms of ultimate causation, habituation may increase fitness by allowing an animal's nervous system to focus on stimuli that signal food, mates, or real danger instead of wasting time or energy on a vast number of other stimuli that are irrelevant to the animal's survival and reproduction.





 Imprinting is learning limited to a sensitive period

Some of the most interesting cases where learning interacts closely with innate behavior involve the phenomenon known as imprinting, learning that is limited to a specific time period in an animal's life and that is generally irreversible. You may have seen young ducks or geese following their mother. Mother-offspring bonding in species with parental care is a critical part of the reproductive cycle. If bonding fails to happen, the parent will not initiate care of the infant. The result is certain death for the offspring and loss of reproductive fitness for the parent. But how do the young know whom--or what--to follow? In his most famous study, Konrad Lorenz divided a clutch of graylag goose eggs, leaving some with the mother and putting the rest in an incubator. The young reared by the mother showed normal behavior, following her about as goslings and eventually growing up to interact and mate with other geese. When the artificially incubated eggs hatched, the geese spent their first few hours with the researcher instead of with their mother. From that day on, they steadfastly followed Lorenz and showed no recognition of their own mother or other adults of their own species (FIGURE 51.9). As adults, the birds continued to prefer the company of Lorenz and other humans over that of their own species, and they sometimes even initiated courtship behavior with humans.

Fig 51-9. Imprinting. Konrad Lorenz was "mother" to these imprinted geese.

Apparently, graylag geese have no innate sense of "mother" or "I am a goose, you are a goose." Instead, they simply respond to and identify with the first object they encounter that has certain key characteristics. What is innate in these birds is the ability or tendency to respond; the outside world provides the imprinting stimulus, something to which the response will be directed. The most important imprinting stimulus in Lorenz's graylag geese was movement of an object away from the young, although the effect was greater if the object emitted some sound. The sound did not have to be that of a goose, however; Lorenz found that a box with a ticking clock in it was readily and permanently accepted as "mother."

In contrast to other types of learning, imprinting is distinguished by a sensitive period, a limited phase in an animal's development when learning of particular behaviors can take place. Lorenz found, for example, that geese totally isolated from any moving objects during the first two days after hatching, which is the sensitive period for imprinting on parents, failed to imprint on anything afterward. Imprinting has commonly been thought of as involving very young animals and rather short sensitive periods. But it is now clear that a similar learning process occurs in older animals and that the sensitive period may be of various durations. For example, just as a young bird requires imprinting to "know" its parents, the adults must also imprint to recognize their young. For a day or two after their young hatch, adult herring gulls will accept and even defend a strange chick introduced into their nesting territory. After imprinting, which is probably based largely on individually variable cues, such as the call notes of chicks, the adults will kill and eat any strange chick.

By imprinting on their parents, young birds first learn who will care for them and subsequently learn species identity and the kind of bird they should mate with later in life. Not only does this sexual imprinting occur later, but the sensitive period lasts longer. For example, in one study involving two closely related species of finches, young males of one species were reared first with members of their own species, then with members of the other species during their several-week-long sensitive period for sexual identity. Later, when exposed to females of their own species, they mated quite reluctantly. They readily mated with females of the other species, however, even when they had not seen any members of that species for as long as eight years. Identification with the second species had been permanently imprinted. Although a sensitive period and irreversibility characterize imprinting, these phenomena are not always rigidly fixed. For example, the cross-fostered finches did eventually mate with females of their own species.





 Bird song provides a model system for understanding the development of behavior

A considerable amount of research on how animals learn has focused on bird songs. Some relatively simple bird calls, such as the crowing of a rooster, seem to develop and improve without any type of learning. Thus, researchers interested in learning have focused on the songbirds, such as the sparrows and canaries, especially on the development of elaborate calls by the males. Such research has revealed that the learning techniques for mastering calls vary, depending on the songbird species.

Some songbirds have a sensitive period for developing their songs. In white-crowned sparrows, for example, the sensitive period occurs during the first 50 days of life. Although the young bird does not sing during this phase, it memorizes the song of its own species by listening to other white-crowned sparrows sing. Behavioral biologists call this memorized song a template. In laboratory experiments, sparrows can form this template by listening to tape recordings during the 50-day sensitive period. But if a bird is isolated throughout this sensitive period, unable to hear either real sparrows or recordings, it fails to develop the adult song typical of its species.

The sensitive period when a white-crowned sparrow forms a song template is followed by a second learning phase, when the juvenile bird sings some tentative notes that researchers call a subsong. With practice, the sparrow's subsong gradually improves until it sounds like the fully developed adult song of the species. During this practice phase, the juvenile bird hears its own singing and compares that vocal output with the template that was memorized during the sensitive learning period. In fact, sparrows that are experimentally deafened at the end of the sensitive phase fail to improve on their subsong, which they continue to sing into adulthood. During normal song development, once a sparrow's song matches the memorized template, it "crystallizes" as the final song, and the bird sings only the adult white-crowned sparrow song for the rest of its life (FIGURE 51.10a).

Fig 51-10. Two kinds of bird-song development.

Additional experiments revealed even more complexity in how birds learn their songs. When isolated white-crowned sparrows more than 50 days old were exposed to live singing adults of another species, they learned the song of the other species. Because a young bird can interact socially with a live singing adult, the live model provides a much stronger and more diverse set of stimuli than a taped song. These strong stimuli can overcome the developmentally fixed tendency to acquire only a white-crowned sparrow song. Again we see that an innate tendency can be modified by experience and is not necessarily inflexible. Furthermore, the sensitive period proved to be longer when the stimulus was a live bird than when it was a taped song.

We humans also have a sensitive period for learning vocalizations. It is well known that foreign languages are learned most easily up until the teen years. Of course, this sensitive period is not rigidly fixed. Adults can learn new languages, but adults usually require much more time and effort to become fluent than a child does. Also, adults are much less flexible than children at learning to produce new sounds.

Until recently, researchers assumed that all birds had to listen to themselves to develop a specific song. But eastern phoebes experimentally deafened early in life, well before they began to sing, developed normal songs of their species. Thus, there are important exceptions to the song-learning scenario seen in white-crowned sparrows. In fact, in certain songbirds, including canaries, a more open-ended development of song occurs (FIGURE 51.10b). Canaries have no sensitive period for song learning. A young canary begins with a subsong, but the full song it develops is not crystallized, as it is in white-crowned sparrows. Each year, an adult male canary learns a new song. Between breeding seasons, the song becomes flexible again. During this "plastic song" stage, the male creates a new, more elaborate song by adding syllables. The male sings the new song during the next breeding season, after which a plastic song stage leads to still another vocal version. And so on, year after year.

Biologist Fernando Nottebohm identified the region of the forebrain responsible for song learning in canaries. He found that this region in male canaries shows dramatic individual variation in size according to the season and the complexity of an individual male's song. Brains are largest during the breeding season and in males with the most elaborate songs. The shrinking of this brain region at the end of the breeding season may be a mechanism for erasing unneeded songs. Subsequent regeneration of neurons in the brain during the plastic song phase provides a way for new song learning to take place. From an adaptive perspective, the ability of male canaries to learn new songs more than once in their lifetime must be critically important to their fitness, as this adaptation requires a considerable investment of energy. Nottebohm's findings illustrate the important results that can be gleaned from studies melding neurobiology and behavioral ecology.

By analyzing the development of bird song, we can see why a simple division between innate and learned components of behavior has little value. There are both innate and learned influences in bird song development, but the interplay of these factors belies an innate/learned dichotomy.





 Many animals can learn to associate one stimulus with another

Many traditional studies in behavioral science were concerned with the proximate causes of associative learning, the ability of many animals to learn to associate one stimulus with another. Well known from the laboratory studies of Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov in the early 1900s, a type of associative learning called classical conditioning involves learning to associate an arbitrary stimulus with a reward or punishment. Pavlov sprayed powdered meat into dogs' mouths, causing them to salivate (primarily a physiological rather than a behavioral response). Just before the spraying, however, he exposed the dogs to a sound, such as a ringing bell or a clicking metronome. Eventually, the dogs salivated readily in response to the sound alone, which they had learned to associate with the normal stimulus. Similar types of conditioning experiments have been carried out with other animals.

Another type of associative learning is operant conditioning, also called trial-and-error learning. Here, an animal learns to associate one of its own behaviors with a reward or punishment and then tends to repeat or avoid that behavior. For example, predators quickly learn to associate certain kinds of potential prey with painful experiences and modify their behavior accordingly (FIGURE 51.11).

Fig 51-11. Operant conditioning. A young coyote has probably learned from receiving a face full of painful quills to be wary of porcupines.

The best-known laboratory studies involving operant conditioning date from the 1930s work of American psychologist B. F. Skinner. A rat or other animal placed in a "Skinner box" finds and manipulates a lever in the box, usually by accident, and is rewarded by the release of food. The animal quickly learns to associate manipulation of the lever with a food reward. Such learning is the basis for most of the animal training done by humans, in which the trainer typically encourages a behavior by rewarding the animal. Eventually, the animal performs the behavior on command, without always receiving a reward.





 Practice and exercise may explain the ultimate bases of play

Many mammals and some birds engage in behavior that can best be described as play. Such behavior has no apparent external goal but involves movements closely associated with goal-directed behaviors. For example, playful stalking and attacking of conspecifics (other members of the same species) occurs in many predator species, such as those of the cat and dog families (FIGURE 51.12). Although this behavior does not usually involve painful bites, the animals grab and mouth one another, using movements similar to those used to capture and kill prey. A study of bottlenose dolphins in Australia revealed that young dolphins spend long periods away from their mothers in groups of juveniles engaged in a full range of social and sexual play. African lions and dolphins are social animals, and a social lifestyle is one of the hallmarks of mammalian species that routinely engage in play.

Fig 51-12. Play behavior. The roughhousing behavior of these lion cubs evolved in spite of the energy it consumes and the risks it poses. Practicing survival behavior (such as capturing prey), experimenting with social roles, and building a healthy body through exercise are three possible benefits of play.

Another common feature of play is that it is potentially dangerous or costly. Baboons sometimes kill and eat juvenile vervet monkeys, and they are most successful in doing so when the monkeys are playing in groups away from adults. In a study of caged ibex, a type of wild goat, play resulted in at least 5 out of 14 kids sustaining injuries that produced limps. "Horsing around" often produces similar injuries in human kids.

Play obviously consumes energy, and the risks to life and limb result in significant additional costs. What could be the ultimate adaptive basis for such seemingly pointless behavior? The "practice hypothesis" suggests that play is a type of learning that allows animals to perfect behaviors needed in functional circumstances. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that play is most common in young animals. However, movements used in play show little improvement after their first few practices. An equally likely ultimate explanation for play is the "exercise hypothesis," which suggests that play is adaptive because it keeps the muscular and cardiovascular systems in top condition. The exercise hypothesis also predicts that play should be especially common in young animals, because they typically do not have to exert themselves in useful activities while under the protection and care of their parents. However, recent studies of beluga whales and several species of dolphins indicate that play, such as creating complex air bubbles, is also common in adults, at least in captivity.





 The study of cognition connects nervous system function with behavior

The term cognition is variously defined. In a narrow sense, it is synonymous with consciousness, or awareness. In a broad sense--the way we use the term in this book--cognition is the ability of an animal's nervous system to perceive, store, process, and use information gathered by sensory receptors. The study of animal cognition, called cognitive ethology, examines the connection between an animal's nervous system and its behavior. Cognitive ethology includes, but is not limited to, the study of animal consciousness, or awareness.

One area of research in cognitive ethology investigates how an animal's brain represents physical stimuli from the environment. For instance, what kind of calculations, if any, does the brain of a dog make about where a Frisbee will land? What is the nature of the dog's internal representation of the spatial relationships between the spinning Frisbee and other objects in the immediate environment? Questions such as these, concerned with internal representations of an animal's physical surroundings, are separate and distinct from questions about consciousness.





 Animals use various cognitive mechanisms during movement through space

Directed movement enables animals to avoid predators or poisons, migrate to a more favorable environment, obtain food, and find mates and nest sites. The mechanisms animals use for "finding their way" vary with the spatial scale of the trip and the kind of animal. We will survey three kinds of movement that use mechanisms of increasing cognitive complexity: kinesis and taxis, use of landmarks, and cognitive maps.

Kinesis and Taxis

The simplest mechanisms of movement are kineses and taxes. A kinesis is a simple change in activity or turning rate in response to a stimulus. Sow bugs, or wood lice, become more active in dry areas and less active in humid areas, a simple behavior that tends to keep these animals in moist environments. The animals do not move toward or away from specific conditions, but since they slow down in a favorable environment, they tend to stay there. In contrast, a taxis is a more or less automatic, oriented movement toward or away from some stimulus. For example, housefly larvae are negatively phototactic after feeding, automatically moving away from light; this simple response presumably ensures that the flies remain in an area where they are harder for predators to detect. Trout exhibit positive rheotaxis (from the Greek rheos, current); they automatically swim or orient themselves in an upstream direction, which keeps them from being swept away.

Use of Landmarks Within a Familiar Area

In FIGURE 51.2, we looked at a classic experiment on how digger wasps find their nest entrances. Tinbergen moved a circle of pinecones that had previously surrounded a nest entrance and observed that the wasp landed in the center of the pinecones, even though the nest entrance wasn't there. The wasp was using the pinecones as a landmark. The use of landmarks is a more complex cognitive mechanism than a taxis or kinesis. The wasp flies toward a stimulus (the center of the pinecones), as in a taxis, but the pinecone circle is an arbitrary landmark the animal must learn. One nest entrance may have pinecones around it, while another may be next to a pile of stones. Each wasp has to learn the unique landmarks of each individual nest site.

Many animals learn the particular set of landmarks in their area and use those landmarks to find their way within the area. Honeybees, for example, keep track of the nectar supplies from their local flowers and concentrate their foraging on the flowers that are currently most nectar-rich. The bees use landmarks, among other mechanisms, to revisit the most productive flowers. In 2000, a team of biologists reported that they had tracked the foraging movements of honeybees by fitting the insects with tiny transponders (FIGURE 51.14a). Four-day-old honeybees made only short, nonforaging trips out of the hive (FIGURE 51.14b). Slightly older bees, six days old, made longer exploratory trips, but did not yet forage. Only older, fully mature bees foraged, and they moved in a "bee line," back and forth between the hive and nectar-rich flower fields. The earlier exploratory excursions were apparently required to learn a complex set of landmarks throughout the local area.

Cognitive Maps

An animal can move around its environment in a flexible and efficient manner using landmark orientation alone. Honeybees, for instance, might learn ten or so landmarks and locate their hive and flowers in relation to those landmarks. A more powerful mechanism is a cognitive map. A cognitive map is an internal representation, or code, of the spatial relationships among objects in an animal's surroundings. It is actually very difficult to distinguish experimentally between an animal that is simply using landmarks and one that is using an internal map. The best evidence for cognitive maps comes from research on birds called jays. A jay stores food in caches, from which the bird can retrieve the food later. An individual jay may store food in thousands of caches. It not only relocates each cache, but also keeps track of food quality, bypassing caches in which the food was relatively perishable and would have decayed. Research by Alan Kamil, of the Universty of Nebraska, suggests that jays use cognitive maps to memorize the locations of their food caches.

Migration Behavior

The most extensive studies of how animal cognition functions in movement have involved animals that exhibit migration, regular movement over relatively long distances. Migrating animals generally make one round trip between two regions each year, although there is considerable variation among species. The most notable examples are the migrations of birds, whales, a few butterfly species, and certain oceangoing fish. How is it, for example, that birds called golden plovers find their way over 13,000 km from their arctic breeding grounds to southeastern South America? Even more remarkable, some populations of these birds return to the Hawaiian and Marquesas Islands, small pieces of land in a vast expanse of ocean (FIGURE 51.15).

Fig 51-15. Migration routes of the golden plover. These birds navigate vast expanses of ocean to the relatively small Hawaiian and Marquesas Islands (yellow). The ground-nesting plovers migrate from warm winter feeding areas to seasonally rich, essentially predator-free Arctic breeding grounds during the short Arctic summer.

Migrating animals use one of three mechanisms (or some combination of the three) to find their way. In piloting, an animal moves from one familiar landmark to another until it reaches its destination. Piloting is used mostly for short-distance movements. In orientation, an animal detects compass directions and travels in a particular straight-line path for a certain distance or until it reaches its destination. The most complex process is navigation, in which an animal determines its present location relative to other locations in addition to detecting compass direction (orientation). If you were dropped off at an unfamiliar spot and told that your home was directly to the north, you could use a compass and straight-line travel to get home; that is, you could use orientation. But a compass alone would not be adequate if you were not told which way to go; to choose the right direction, you would need to determine where you were in relation to home. You would need a complex mental picture of your surroundings, a so-called map sense. FIGURE 51.16 reinforces this distinction between orientation and navigation.

Fig 51-16. Orientation versus navigation in juvenile and adult starlings. Researchers captured about 11,000 starlings in the Netherlands during the birds' migration from their breeding grounds in northeastern Europe to their wintering grounds in Great Britain, Ireland, and northern France. After being transported to Switzerland (red arrow) and released, juvenile starlings, which had never made the journey before, continued to fly west and southwest (blue arrows), which brought them to Spain. Adults, all of whom had made the trip at least once before, flew northwest (green arrow), an atypical direction but one that took them to their usual wintering grounds. Members of both age-groups were able to detect direction, but only the adults exhibited true navigation because they had developed a "map sense" and could determine where their original goal was relative to the site to which they were transported.

What sorts of cues do animals use for orientation and navigation? Some species of birds and other animals commonly use a combination of compass references: Earth's magnetic field, the sun (for daytime travel), and the stars (for nighttime travel). Calibrated against one another, these indicators provide excellent, albeit complex, cues to direction.

Cognitive ethologists are interested in how animals utilize cues in moving from place to place. Orienting by the sun or stellar constellations requires an internal timing device to compensate for the continuous daily movement of celestial objects. Consider what would happen if you started walking one day, orienting yourself by keeping the sun on your left. In the morning, you would be heading south; but by evening, you would be heading back north, having made a circle and gotten nowhere. The stars also shift their apparent position as Earth rotates. One night-migrating bird, the indigo bunting, avoids the need for a timing mechanism by doing what ancient human navigators did: fixing on the North Star, which moves little. Many migrants, however, use an internal clock. For example, if an experimental sun is held in a constant position, starlings change their orientation steadily at a rate of about 15&#176; per hour. This normally compensates for the change in the sun's position as Earth rotates on its axis. The calibration problem is very complex because the apparent location of the sun shifts at a variable rate, being fastest at midday. Furthermore, the apparent position of celestial objects changes as the animal moves over its migration route. Recently, Kenneth and Mary Able, of the State University of New York at Albany, discovered that for one long-distance migrant--the Savannah sparrow--the magnetic and celestial compasses are reset during brief stopovers along the migration route.





 The study of consciousness poses a unique challenge for scientists

A simple but profound question is whether nonhuman animals are consciously aware of themselves and of the world around them. An equally profound question is whether the study of consciousness (awareness) is within the purview of science.

Many people who have spent a lot of time with pets or wild animals argue that these animals are not behaving like sophisticated robots. But is a dog aware of itself when it is chasing a Frisbee? Do animals "feel" pleasure or sadness as we do? To date, we have no way of answering such questions directly, because conscious awareness is known only to the individual that experiences it, and unlike phenomena that can be studied objectively, it is not associated with any observable behavioral or physiological change.

Donald Griffin, of Princeton University, is a foremost proponent of the view that conscious thinking is an inherent and essential part of the behavior of many nonhuman animals. Griffin argues that if other animals behave in ways we associate with conscious processing in ourselves, perhaps it makes sense to assume that they have the same underlying awareness. In her famous field studies, Jane Goodall has described cognitive decision making in chimpanzees. Griffin suggests that such abilities may extend to many nonprimate branches of the phylogenetic tree as well. He argues, for example, that conscious processes are at the heart of such behaviors as the injury-feigning "strategy" of some species of ground-nesting birds (FIGURE 51.17).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-17. Injury-feigning display. This killdeer uses deception to defend her nest against predators or human disturbance. When danger threatens, she leaves the nest, which is usually concealed, and begins an elaborate display as though she has a broken wing. This behavior has the effect of leading the potential predator away from the nest. As the predator gets close to her, she simply flies away. She returns to the nest only after the danger has passed. Killdeers show extraordinary individual variation in the form and use of this display. In addition, individual killdeers use multiple variations of the display, depending on the type of threat to the nest and whether or not they have experienced the threat before. Some cognitive ethologists point to versatile behavior such as this to support the hypothesis that nonhuman animals are conscious, thinking beings.

Because of the difficulty of scientifically testing questions about consciousness, some researchers assume the most conservative position--that most animals are not aware. There are, of course, intermediate positions within the argument, and no behavioral biologist would argue that all animals behave in ways that indicate consciousness. Moreover, other animals may lack the ability to consciously integrate information (to "think") to the same extent as humans do, but is this a matter of degree--a continuum of abilities--or are humans fundamentally different in some behavioral respect? Ultimately, the answers we find about animal consciousness may profoundly affect how we interact with other animals--and how we view ourselves as well.





 Sociobiology places social behavior in an evolutionary context

Social behavior, broadly defined, is any kind of interaction between two or more animals, usually of the same species. Although most sexually reproducing species must be social for part of their life cycle in order to reproduce, some species spend most of their lives in close association with conspecifics. Social interactions have long been a research focus for scientists who study behavior. The complexity of behavior increases dramatically when interactions among individuals are considered. Aggression, courtship, cooperation, and even deception are part of the range of social behavior.

Social behavior raises particularly interesting questions about evolutionary adaptation. In morphology and physiology, it is often obvious how some feature of an organism is beneficial. Wings, for instance, are adaptations for flight. But with social behavior, the answers are sometimes less intuitive. As we will see, males and females in some species may have long, complicated courtship periods, which raises the question of why mating could not be done more simply. And some animals behave altruistically (unselfishly), in ways that appear to reduce the number of offspring they produce. Thus, social behavior can appear inefficient or even counterproductive to reproductive success. Nevertheless, extensive research is beginning to reveal how these behaviors are adaptive and how they could have evolved by natural selection.

The discipline of sociobiology applies evolutionary theory to the study and interpretation of social behavior. Much of the evolutionary theory underlying the modern study of social behavior was conceived by the late British biologist William Hamilton, who considered how natural selection acts on the social behavior of individuals. The evolutionary emphasis of Hamilton's work underlies sociobiology and the more general field of behavioral ecology as it is practiced today. The development of sociobiology into a coherent method of analysis and interpretation was further catalyzed in 1975 with the publication of E. O. Wilson's watershed book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis.





 Competitive social behaviors often represent contests for resources

Because members of a population have a common niche, there is a strong potential for conflict, especially among members of species that normally maintain densities near what the environment can sustain. Sometimes social behavior seems to involve cooperation, as when a group carries out behavior more efficiently than is possible for a single individual (FIGURE51.18). Keep in mind, however, that even when behavior requires some cooperation and seems to be mutually beneficial to interacting individuals, as in mating behavior, each participant usually acts in a way that will maximize its benefits, even if this is at a cost to the other participant. In this section, we examine competitive social interactions, where this "selfish" aspect of behavior is most obvious. Subsequent sections focus on social behaviors involving cooperation.

This line of white pelicans is moving toward a school of fish. This cooperative behavior makes it more difficult for fish to escape by swimming around the birds.

Agonistic Behavior

In agonistic behavior, a contest involving both threatening and submissive behavior determines which competitor gains access to some resource, such as food or a mate. Sometimes the encounter involves tests of strength. More commonly, the contestants engage in threat displays that make them look large or fierce, often with exaggerated posturing and vocalizations. Eventually, one individual stops threatening and presents a submissive or appeasement display, in effect surrendering. Much of this behavior includes ritual, the use of symbolic activity, with no serious harm done to either combatant (FIGURE 51.19). Dogs and wolves show aggression by baring their teeth; erecting their ears, tail, and fur; standing upright; and looking directly at their opponent--all of which make the animal appear large and threatening. The eventual loser, on the other hand, sleeks its fur, tucks its tail, and looks away.

Fig 51-19. Ritual wrestling by rattlesnakes. The rattlesnakes attempt to pin each other to the ground, but they never use their deadly fangs in such combat.

The degree to which combat is ritualized depends on the scarcity of the resource and the likelihood that the resource will be available again. For example, male ground squirrels often inflict severe injury upon, or even kill, each other when battling for access to sexually receptive females. In this case, the females for which the ground squirrels are competing are in estrus and receptive to male courtship for only a few hours each year; thus, a male's entire reproductive fitness may depend on his ability to compete against other males that one day.

In animals that live in fairly permanent social groups, there are often conflicts in which there is no clear winner and loser; although one of the animals may win a particular face-off, that individual would still benefit from having friendly relations with the "loser." In this case, there is usually some kind of reconciliation behavior between the conflicting individuals following the conflict itself. For example, a chimpanzee that has threatened another member of its group may invite reconciliation by a hand gesture, leading to a bout of friendly grooming (FIGURE 51.20). Social primates seem to spend substantial time in reconciliation and pacification-type behavior.

Fig 51-20. Reconciliation in chimpanzees. This photo shows two male chimpanzees 10 minutes after a conflict between them. The male at left had threatened the male at right, who had eventually run up a tree. Now the male at left initiates reconciliation by a hand gesture and by making eye contact. Soon after, the two males descended to the ground and groomed each other.

Dominance Hierarchies

Many animals live in social groups maintained by agonistic behavior. Chickens are an example. If several hens who are unfamiliar with one another are put together, they respond by skirmishing and pecking each other. Eventually, the group establishes a clear "pecking order"--a more or less linear dominance hierarchy. Within a group, the alpha (top-ranked) hen controls the behavior of all the others, often by mere threats rather than actual pecking. The beta (second-ranked) hen similarly subdues all others except the alpha, and so on down the line to the omega, or lowest-ranking, animal. The advantage to the top-ranked bird is obvious; it is assured access to resources, such as food. And for lower-ranked animals, the system ensures that they do not waste energy or risk harm in futile combat.

Territoriality

A territory is an area that an individual defends, usually excluding other members of its own species. Territories are typically used for feeding, mating, and rearing young. A territory is usually fixed in location, its size varying with the species, the territory's function, and the amount of resources available. Song sparrow pairs, for example, may have territories of about 3,000 m2, in which they carry out all activities during the several months of their breeding season. Gannets and most other seabirds, in contrast, mate and nest in territories of only a few square meters or less and feed away from their territories (FIGURE 51.21). Bull sea lions defend small territories used only for mating, whereas red squirrels have rather large territories apparently based on feeding patterns. In many species that defend their territories only during the breeding season, individuals may form social groups at other times. Chickadees, for instance, form monogamous breeding pairs that defend small territories in the summer. In the winter, they form larger flocks, enabling the birds to forage more efficiently and benefit from the increased protection from predators that results from membership in a large group.

Fig 51-21. Territories. Gannets nest virtually only a peck apart and defend their territories by calling and pecking at each other. This is a population of Australian gannets in New Zealand.

Note that there is a distinction between a territory and a home range, which is simply the area in which an animal roams about and which is often not defended. In some species, such as breeding song sparrows, territory and home range are the same; but for other species, such as gannets, a territory is considerably smaller than the home range. The distinction is not always clear. Gray squirrels, for example, typically have home ranges that overlap extensively, but one individual may defend part of the range from competitors.

Territories are established and defended through agonistic behavior, and an individual that has gained a territory is often difficult to dislodge. Why do owners usually win? One explanation in behavioral ecology is that a territory is worth more to an owner than to an intruder because the owner is already familiar with it. Thus, because it has more to gain from a territory, an owner is more likely to escalate a battle than is an intruder. In addition, established territory holders are likely to be older and more experienced at engaging in agonistic interactions.

Natural selection does not always favor territoriality, and not all species are territorial. However, for those animals that are, the territory can provide exclusive access to food supplies, breeding areas, and places to raise young. Moreover, familiarity with a specific area may help individuals avoid predators. In a territorial species, such benefits outweigh the energy costs of defending the territory and thereby increase fitness.

Ownership of a territory is usually continually proclaimed; this is a primary function of most familiar bird songs, as well as the noisy bellowing of sea lions and the chatter of red squirrels. Other animals may use scent marks or frequent patrols to warn potential invaders (FIGURE 51.22). Gray wolves, which live in packs in huge territories (hundreds of square kilometers), use multiple strategies to advertise territorial boundaries, including scent marking and howling. Multiple signals help dispel any ambiguities as to the boundaries of a territory, thereby minimizing the risk that one group will accidentally stray into the territory of a rival pack. This is especially important for wolves because actual face-to-face meetings between groups are often violent.

The odor will serve as a chemical "No Trespassing" sign to other males. (b) Another male cheetah snifts a marked rock. With their keen olfactory sense, cheetahs can distinguish their own marks from those left by others. These signals help prevent face-to-face meetings that could escalate into violence.

Defense of territory is usually directed only at conspecifics; a white-crowned sparrow may live within a song sparrow's territory because a different species usually occupies a different niche, or role in the environment, and is less likely to be a direct competitor. Another adaptive reason for concentrating defense on conspecifics is that they are likely to mate with a territory holder's mate.

Although dominance hierarchies and territoriality evolved as a result of their advantages to individuals, such systems have important consequences at the population level because they tend to stabilize density. If resources were allocated evenly among all members of a population, the "fair share" that each individual received might not be enough to sustain anyone, leading to occasional population crashes. With dominance and territoriality, at least some individuals receive an adequate amount of a resource. In fact, if a resource such as food becomes scarce, territories often expand somewhat. In addition, there are usually individuals low in the hierarchy or lacking territories that are ready to move up or step in if one of the successful individuals dies. The result may be relatively stable populations from year to year.





 Natural selection favors mating behavior that maximizes the quantity or quality of mating partners

Reproductive behavior includes seeking mates, choosing among potential mates, competing for mates, and, in some species, caring for offspring. Behavioral ecology and its offshoot, sociobiology, seek to explain mating behaviors as outcomes of natural selection reinforcing those variations that enhance reproductive success.

Courtship

Courtship consists of behavior patterns that lead up to copulation (or to gamete release in species with external fertilization; see Chapter 46). In many species, courtship consists of a series of displays and movements by either the male, the female, or both. The elaborate courtship behavior of stickleback fish provides a classic example (FIGURE 51.23). Stickleback courtship lasts only a few minutes, but some animal species court for days or even months. Of what possible benefit to the individual is such elaborate courtship behavior? Put another way, how can natural selection explain the evolution of courtship behavior? Part of the answer is that courtship enables animals to identify potential mates of the same species. This would explain why courtship patterns are often especially elaborate and distinct when two closely related species occupy the same area. Also, courtship can help establish that a potential mate is physiologically ready to reproduce. In sticklebacks, for example, courtship succeeds only if the female displays a swollen belly, which is full of eggs, and the male demonstrates that he has built a nest (see FIGURE 51.23). But if courtship were only a matter of identifying a potential partner that is physiologically competent to reproduce, then such behavior could be much simpler than it is in many species. Much of courtship behavior apparently evolved because of sexual selection, an evolutionary process that we introduced in Chapter 23.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-23. Courtship behavior in the three-spined stickleback. Males are strongly territorial, defending an area in which they have built a nest. If a gravid (egg-carrying) female approaches, her swollen belly inhibits the male's aggressive behavior and elicits zigzag swimming in the male. This entices the female to swim closer, which in turn stimulates the male to swim to the nest and stick his snout inside. This action stimulates the female to wriggle into the tunnel. The male then nuzzles her tail, which stimulates her to spawn, after which she swims out the other end of the nest. The male then enters and deposits sperm on the eggs, after which he immediately and quite aggressively drives the female out of the area, apparently because she lacks the swollen belly that would inhibit his aggression.

The hypothesis that a courtship behavior is an evolutionary product of sexual selection predicts a basic difference between the mating behaviors of males and females. The difference follows from the potential partners' relative amounts of parental investment in offspring. Parental investment refers to the time and resources an individual must spend to produce and nurture offspring. Eggs are generally much larger than sperm and are thus more energetically expensive to produce. Eutherian (placental) mammals produce relatively small eggs (though still much bigger than sperm), but the mother invests considerable time and resources in carrying and nourishing the offspring before their birth. In most species, a male's lower investment per offspring, compared to a female's, means that he can maximize his reproductive output by fertilizing the eggs of many females. Thus, a male's reproductive success is often proportional to his number of partners. This explains why competition among males for mates is common in the animal kingdom. In contrast, the reproductive success of females is less often dependent on the number of partners than it is on the vigor of the limited number of offspring she can produce. This explains why the females of many animal species are so selective in their choices of mates. Healthy mates provide the best opportunity for producing healthy offspring.

This distinction based on parental investment--male competition/female choice--can account for many of the differences between males and females in their morphology and courtship behavior. In some cases, male competition has probably contributed to the evolution of agonistic behaviors and even weapons such as deer antlers, which the males use to compete for mates. But female choice seems to have an even more powerful effect in shaping the secondary sexual characteristics and courtship behaviors of males. For example, the showy displays of peacocks and other male birds during mating season have little to do with direct male-male competition and much to do with advertising robust health to choosy females (see FIGURE 23.16).

As another example of how female choice affects the evolution of males, consider the courtship behavior of stalk-eyed flies (FIGURE 51.24). The eyes of these insects are at the tips of stalks, which are longer in males than in females. During courtship, a male presents himself to a female, front end on. Researchers have documented that females are more likely to mate with those males that have relatively long eyestalks; thus, female choice has been a strong selection factor in the evolution of long eyestalks in males. But why would the females favor this seemingly arbitrary trait? Behavioral ecologists have correlated certain genetic disorders in the male flies with an inability to develop long eyestalks. Such studies support the hypothesis that females are basing their mate choices on characteristics that are indicators of male quality.

Fig 51-24. Male stalk-eyed fly. These Malaysian insects have eyes at the end of elongated stalks. Females usually select mates with relatively long eyestalks. The stalks are shorter in males with certain genetic disorders.

Of course, the distinction between male competition and female choice becomes blurry if you consider that males compete by vying for female choice and not just by engaging in male-male confrontations. And in some species, it is the females who compete directly for mates and the males who are the more selective sex in choosing mates. This is common in species where males provide most of the care for offspring, which raises their parental investment. In the case of sticklebacks, both partners are heavily invested in offspring--the female in her costly production of eggs and the male in his investment in the building and protection of the nest. If you take another look at FIGURE 51.23, you will see that the female choice focuses on courtship signals that advertise a male's ability to provide parental care.

Thus, the specifics of courtship behavior are tied to the natural history of the particular species. But the fascinating variety of dance steps, songs, and display organs are all connected by a comprehensive theory of courtship as an evolutionary product of sexual selection. According to this theory, specific courtship behaviors, like other social behaviors, evolve because they are practiced by the most reproductively successful individuals, which increases the representation of the genes for these behaviors in populations.

Mating Systems

The mating relationship between males and females varies a great deal from species to species. In many species, mating is promiscuous, with no strong pair-bonds or lasting relationships. In species where the mates remain together for a longer period, the relationship may be monogamous (one male mating with one female) or polygamous (an individual of one sex mating with several of the other). Polygamous relationships most often involve a single male and many females, called polygyny, which can be explained in terms of a difference in parental investment. However, in some species, a single female mates with several males, a relationship called polyandry.

The needs of the young are an important ultimate factor in the evolution of mating systems. Most newly hatched birds cannot care for themselves and require a large, continuous food supply that one parent may not be able to provide. In such cases, a male may ultimately leave more viable offspring by helping a single mate than by going off to seek more mates. This may explain why most birds are monogamous. In birds with young that feed and care for themselves almost immediately after hatching, there is less need for parents to stay together. Males of these species can maximize their reproductive success by seeking other mates, and polygyny is relatively common in such birds. In the case of mammals, the lactating female is often the only food source for the young; males usually play no role. And in species where the males protect the females and young, they typically take care of many at once in a harem.

Another factor that influences mating systems and parental care is certainty of paternity. Young born or eggs laid by a female definitely contain the female's genes. But even within a normally monogamous relationship, these young may have been fathered by a male other than the female's usual mate. The certainty of paternity is relatively low in most species with internal fertilization because the acts of mating and birth (or mating and egg laying) are separated over time. This could explain why exclusively male parental care occurs in very few species of birds and mammals. However, certainty of paternity is much higher when egg laying and mating occur together, as in external fertilization. This may explain why parental care in aquatic invertebrates, fishes, and amphibians, when it occurs at all, is at least as likely to be by males as by females (FIGURE 51.25). Male parental care occurs in only 2 out of 28 (7% ) fish and amphibian families with internal fertilization, but in 61 out of 89 (69% ) families with external fertilization. In fish, even when parental care is given exclusively by males, the mating system is often polygynous, with several females laying eggs in a nest tended by one male.

Fig 51-25. Paternal care by a sea spider. In many species of marine arthropods called pycnogonids, or sea spiders, a male uses one pair of appendages to carry a ball of eggs that he has fertilized after their release from a mate. The male may mate with a few females, adding the bundle of eggs to those already under his care. The pycnogonid species in this photograph is unusual in that males continue to carry and protect their offspring for some time after hatching.

It is important to point out that when behavioral ecologists use such terms as certainty of paternity, they do not mean that animals are aware of those factors when they behave a certain way. Parental behavior correlated with certainty of paternity exists because it has been reinforced over generations by natural selection.





 Social interactions depend on diverse modes of communication

Defining Animal Signals and Communication

Much of what we have discussed under the topics of competitive social interactions and mating behaviors involves animals transmitting information by special behaviors called displays, or signals. In behavioral ecology, a signal is a behavior that causes a change in behavior in another animal. The transmission of, reception of, and response to signals make up what we call communication. Note that physically forcing another individual to behave in a certain way does not qualify as signaling. For example, if you were to push a sprinter out of the starting blocks at a track meet, the sprinter's behavior would change, but your action would not count as a signal. A signal would be shouting "Ready, set, go!" It is characteristic of signals that they are very efficient in energy costs. It takes less energy to shout "Go!" than it does to push someone down the track.

Singing by male birds is an example of signaling. It transmits the information, "This is my territory. Keep out!" and has the effect that other males are less likely to encroach on the male's territory. This is almost certainly an important message of singing; if we play the tape-recorded songs of another male in a male bird's territory, he becomes highly agitated, approaching and sometimes even attacking the speaker. Another bird has not only ignored his warning but has claimed the territory for himself. This simple experiment is so infallible that some bird-watchers routinely use it to find and see secretive birds that would otherwise stay hidden. This "prerecorded message" procedure makes another important point. We cannot get into an animal's brain to determine whether it has received a message sent by another individual. How, then, do we know when communication has occurred? We usually say that communication has occurred when an act by a sender produces a detectable change in the behavior of another individual, the receiver. Bird song is communication because it produces a response.

Animals communicate using visual, auditory, chemical (olfactory), tactile, and electrical signals. Which mode is used to transmit information is closely related to an animal's basic lifestyle. Most terrestrial mammals are nocturnal, which makes visual displays relatively ineffective. But olfactory and auditory signals work as well in the dark as in the light, and most mammalian species emphasize these signals. Birds, by contrast, are mostly diurnal and use mostly visual and auditory signals. They almost never use olfactory signals, probably because they can fly faster than chemical signals can travel. (It is hard to imagine a system in which it would be adaptive for a messenger to arrive before its message.) Unlike most mammals, humans are diurnal and in common with birds use mainly visual and auditory communication. Therefore, we can detect the songs and bright colors that birds use to communicate with each other. This may explain why bird-watching is so popular. If humans had the well-developed olfactory abilities of most mammals and could detect their rich world of chemical cues, mammal-sniffing might be as popular as bird-watching.

Pheromones

Animals that communicate by odors emit chemical signals called pheromones. These are especially common among mammals and insects and often relate to reproductive behavior. Female silkworm moths, for example, emit a pheromone that can attract males from several kilometers away. Once the moths are together, pheromones also trigger specific courtship behaviors. Another example is the familiar trailing behavior of ants, in which scouts release scents that guide other ants to the food (FIGURE 51.26).

Fig 51-26. Fire ants following a pheromone trail. When a worker fire ant of the species Solenopsis invicta finds food on a scouting venture, she deposits a scent trail on her trip back to the ant colony. Other workers can then follow this pheromone trail to the food source.

One of the most complex communication systems--certainly among invertebrates--is that of social, or hive, bees. Pheromones produced by a hive's queen and her daughters, the workers, maintain the social order of honeybee colonies. Recent studies indicate that varied blends of two fatty acids, rather than single chemicals, underlie the social behavior and reproduction of honeybees. The context of a chemical signal can be as important as the chemical itself. When male honeybees (drones) are outside the hive (where they can mate with a queen), they are attracted to her pheromone; however, when drones are inside the hive, they are unaffected by the queen's pheromone.

The Dance of the Honeybee

For maximum foraging efficiency, worker bees must convey to one another the location of good food sources, which may change frequently as various flowers bloom or new patches are discovered. How do bees communicate? The study of honeybee communication has a long and rich tradition of experimental research that continues to reveal new elements of the bees' language. The problem was first studied in the 1940s by Karl von Frisch, who carefully watched individual European honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica) as they returned to special observation hives. A returning bee would quickly become the center of attention by other bees, called followers (FIGURE 51.27a, p. 1144). The returning bee would go through a repetitive behavior that von Frisch called a dance. If the food source was close to the hive (less than 50 m away), the returning bee moved in tight circles while waggling its abdomen from side to side (FIGURE 51.27b). This dance was usually accompanied by the bee's regurgitating some of the acquired nectar. This behavior, which von Frisch called the "round dance," had the effect of exciting the follower bees and motivating them to leave the hive and search for food that was nearby.

Fig 51-27. Communication in bees: one hypothesis. (a) Worker bees cluster around one of their sisters, recently returned from a foraging trip. (b) The round dance indicates that food is near but may provide no information on directionality or specific distance. (c) The waggle dance is performed when food is distant. This dance pattern resembles a figure eight, with a straight run between two semicircular movements. According to von Frisch's hypothesis, the waggle dance indicates both distance and direction. Distance is indicated by the duration of each waggle run or dance and the number of abdominal waggles performed per waggle run. Direction is indicated by the angle (in relation to the vertical surface of the hive) of the straight run that forms part of the dance itself. 
			  
		 For instance, if the straight run is directly upward, this signals that food is in the same direction as the sun. 
			  
		 If the straight run is directly downward, the food is in the direction opposite the sun. 
			  
		 If the angle is 30&#176; to the right of vertical, the food is 30&#176; to the right of the horizontal direction of the sun. And so forth. Odor cues (pheromones) and sound may also convey information about the location and type of food.

However, bees often forage at great distances from the hive, sometimes in excess of 5 km. In such cases, the round dance is insufficient, lacking both directionality and distance cues necessary for the followers to locate the food source efficiently. A worker returning from a longer distance does a "waggle dance" (FIGURE 51.27c): a half-circle swing in one direction, followed by a straight run and then a half-circle swing in the other direction. This dance seems to indicate both direction and distance. The angle of the straight run in relation to the vertical surface of the open hive is the same as the horizontal angle of the food in relation to the sun. For example, if the bee runs at a 30&#176; angle to the right of vertical, the other workers will fly 30&#176; to the right of the horizontal direction of the sun. Distance to the food is indicated by a variety of elements of the waggle dance. For example, a longer straight run during the dance, and hence an increasing number of abdominal waggles per run, indicates a greater distance to the food source. During waggle dances, the bee also regurgitates nectar; thus, when bees leave to forage, they already "know" the type of food to seek, its distance, and its direction. There is also evidence that the sounds and odors emanating from the dancing bee provide information about the food source.





 The concept of inclusive fitness can account for most altruistic behavior

Many social behaviors are selfish, meaning that they benefit the individual at the expense of others, especially competitors. A bird that establishes a territory deprives other individuals of one, and if there is not enough habitat, these other individuals may be unable to breed. Even in species in which individuals do not engage in agonistic behavior, most adaptations that benefit one individual will indirectly harm others. For example, superior foraging ability by one individual may leave less food for others. It is easy to understand the pervasive nature of selfishness if natural selection shapes behavior. Behavior that maximizes an individual's reproductive success will be favored by selection, regardless of how much damage such behavior does to another individual, a local population, or even an entire species.

How, then, can we explain observed examples of what appears to be altruism, or unselfish behavior? On occasion, animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness and increase the fitness of the recipient of the behavior; this is our functional definition of altruism. Consider the Belding ground squirrel, which lives in some mountainous regions of the western United States and is vulnerable to predators such as coyotes and hawks (FIGURE 51.28). If a predator approaches, one of the squirrels often gives a high-pitched alarm call. This alerts unaware individuals, who then retreat to their burrows. Careful observations have confirmed that the conspicuous alarm behavior increases the risk of being killed, because it identifies the caller's location.

Fig 51-28. Altruistic behavior in the Belding ground squirrel. By sounding an alarm call, this Belding ground squirrel warns others of danger, such as an approaching predator. Nearly all alarm calls are given by females.

Another example of altruistic behavior occurs in bee societies, in which the workers are sterile. The workers themselves will never reproduce, but they labor on behalf of a single fertile queen. Furthermore, the workers sting intruders, a behavior that helps defend the hive but results in the death of the worker.

Still another example of altruism is seen in mole rats, highly social rodents that live in underground chambers and tunnels in southern and northeastern Africa (FIGURE 51.29). The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is almost hairless and nearly blind and lives in colonies of 75 to 250 or more individuals. The common mole rat (Cryptomys hottentotus) has hair and generally lives in smaller colonies. In both species, each colony has only one reproducing female, called the queen, who mates with one to three males, called kings. The rest of the colony consists of nonreproductive females and males who forage for underground roots and tubers and care for the queen, the kings, and new offspring still dependent on the queen. The nonreproductive individuals may sacrifice their own lives in trying to protect the queen or kings from snakes or other predators that invade the colony.

(a) Naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber) live in underground colonies made up of a single queen, several kings, and often hundreds of nonreproductive individuals. In this photograph, several nonreproductive individuals, who perform all the maintenance activities of the colony, huddle around the queen and her young. Members of each colony are a closely related family unit. (b) The common mole rat (Cryptomys hottentotus), widespread in southern Africa, is also colonial with only a queen and several kings reproducing. Compared to naked mole rats, however, common mole rat colonies are smaller and more genetically diverse.

Inclusive Fitness

How can a naked mole rat, a worker bee, or a Belding ground squirrel enhance its fitness by aiding other members of the population, which are apt to be its closest competitors? How can altruistic behavior be maintained by evolution if it does not enhance--and in fact may even reduce--the reproductive success of the self-sacrificing individuals? Natural selection favors anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits that increase reproductive success, which in turn propagates the genes responsible for those traits. When parents sacrifice their own personal well-being to produce and aid offspring, this actually increases the fitness of the parents, because it maximizes their genetic representation in the population. But what about helping other close relatives? Like parents and offspring, siblings have half of their genes in common. Therefore, selection might also favor helping one's parents produce more siblings or even helping siblings directly. Evolutionary biologist William Hamilton was the first to realize that selection could result in an animal's increasing its genetic representation in the next generation by "altruistically" helping close relatives other than its own offspring. This realization led to the concept of inclusive fitness, which describes the total effect an individual has on proliferating its genes by producing its own offspring and by providing aid that enables other close relatives to increase the production of their offspring.

Hamilton's Rule and Kin Selection

Hamilton proposed a quantitative measure for predicting when natural selection would favor altruistic acts among related individuals. The three key variables in an act of altruism are the benefit to the recipient (B), the cost to the altruist (C), and the coefficient of relatedness (r). The benefit and cost measure the change in the average number of offspring produced by the recipient and altruist, respectively, resulting from the altruistic act. Thus, B, the benefit, is the average number of extra offspring that the beneficiary of an altruistic act produces; and C, the cost, is how many fewer offspring the altruist produces. Suppose, for example, that members of a human population average two children each. Now consider two brothers who are close in age, reproductively mature, equally fertile, but not yet fathers. One of these young men is close to drowning in heavy surf, and his brother risks his own life to swim out and pull his sibling to safety. The benefit to the almost-drowned brother, the recipient of this altruistic act, is two offspring. Had he drowned, his reproductive output would have been zero. But now, if we use the average, the rescued brother can father two children. The cost to the heroic brother depends on the risk to his own life he took to save his sibling. Let's say that in this kind of surf, an average swimmer has a 5%  chance of drowning. Thus, the cost of the altruistic act is 5%  the number of offspring we would expect if the altruist had not taken the risky plunge. The cost is 0.05 &#160;X&#160; 2, or 0.1.

We now know that B = 2.0 and C = 0.1 for this hypothetical act of altruism, but what about r, the coefficient of relatedness? The coefficient of relatedness equals the probability that a particular gene present in one individual will also be inherited from a common parent or ancestor in a second individual. Between two siblings, such as our imaginary brothers at the beach, any gene in one brother has a 50%  chance of also being present in the other brother. Thus, for siblings, r is 0.5. One way to see this is to review the segregation of homologous chromosomes that occurs when parents produce gametes by meiosis (FIGURE 51.30; also see Chapter 13).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 51-30. The coefficient of relatedness between siblings is 0.5. The red band marks a particular gene on a chromosome of a homologous chromosome pair in one parent. As it is the only gene we will follow, the corresponding chromosomes in the other parent are ignored in calculating r, the coefficient of relatedness. Sibling 1 has inherited the gene we are tracing from parent A. There is a probability of 1/2 that sibling 2 will also inherit this gene from parent A. The coefficient of relatedness between the two siblings is 1/2, or 0.5.

We can now use values of B, C, and r to evaluate whether natural selection would favor the altruistic act in our imaginary scenario. Natural selection favors altruism if  This inequality is called Hamilton's rule. For natural selection to favor an altruistic act, the benefit to the recipient devalued (multiplied) by the coefficient of relatedness must exceed the cost to the altruist. For our surfing brothers, rB = 0.5 &#160;X&#160; 2 = 1 and C = 0.1. This satisfies Hamilton's rule; thus, natural selection would favor this altruistic act of one brother saving another. Any particular gene in the altruist will, on average, be passed on to more offspring if that brother risks the rescue than if he does not. (And among those genes may be some that actually contribute to the altruistic behavior, so these genes, too, are propagated.) The natural selection that favors this kind of altruistic behavior by enhancing reproductive success of relatives is specifically called kin selection.

Kin selection weakens with hereditary distance. While siblings have an r of 0.5, r = 0.25 (1/4) between an aunt and her niece, and r = 0.125 (1/8) between first cousins. Notice that as the degree of relatedness decreases, the rB term in the Hamilton inequality also decreases. Would natural selection favor our strong-swimming surfer rescuing his cousin? For this altruistic act, rB = 0.125 &#160;X&#160; 2 = 0.25, which, luckily for this drowning cousin, is still much smaller than C = 0.1, the cost to the altruist. Of course, the degree of risk the altruist takes comes into play, too. If the potential rescuer is a poor swimmer, he may have a 50%  chance of drowning instead of the 5%  chance for a strong swimmer. In this case, the cost to the altruist would be 0.5 &#160;X&#160; 2 = 1. That's greater than the rB of 0.25 we calculated for the drowning cousin, who better hope a lifeguard is near.

The British geneticist J. B. S. Haldane anticipated the concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection by jokingly saying that he would lay down his life for two brothers or eight cousins. In today's terms, we would say that he would do this because either two brothers or eight cousins would result in as much representation of Haldane's genes as would two of his own offspring.

If kin selection explains altruism, then the examples of unselfish behavior we observe among diverse animal species should involve close relatives. This expectation is met, but often in complex ways. Like most mammals, female Belding ground squirrels (see FIGURE 51.28) settle close to their site of birth, while males settle at distant sites. Thus, only females are likely to live near close relatives, and nearly all alarm calls are given by females (FIGURE 51.31). However, if all of a female's close relatives are dead, she rarely gives alarm calls. In the case of worker bees, the individuals are sterile, and anything they do to help the entire hive benefits the only permanent member who is reproductively active--the queen, who is their mother.

Fig 51-31. Kin selection and altruism in the Belding ground squirrel. This graph helps explain the male-female difference in altruistic behavior of ground squirrels. After they are weaned, males disperse much farther from their birthplaces than do females. Therefore, females are more likely to live near close relations, and alarm calls that warn these relatives increase the inclusive fitness of the altruist.

In the case of naked mole rats, DNA analyses have shown that all the individuals in a colony are closely related. Genetically, the queen appears to be a sibling, daughter, or mother of the kings, and the nonreproductive rats are the queen's direct descendants or her siblings (see FIGURE 51.29a). Hence, when a nonreproductive individual enhances a queen's or king's chances of reproducing, it increases the chances that some genes identical to its own will be passed to the next generation. The scenario for the common mole rat seems to be different (see FIGURE 51.29b). Some individuals may move from one colony to another, making its colonial groups more genetically diverse and decreasing the opportunities for kin selection.

Some researchers posit that only by living in cooperative groups can mole rats obtain enough food to survive where resources are in short supply. For both the common mole rat and the naked mole rat, cooperative behavior enhances tunneling and underground foraging for roots and tubers, factors that may enable these two species to inhabit arid regions. Three other species of mole rats, which are not colonial, are found only where water and other resources are relatively plentiful. Thus, resource limitation may underlie the evolution of colonial life among these mammals and perhaps the evolution of the kind of altruistic behavior seen in the naked mole rat.

Some animals occasionally behave altruistically toward others who are not relatives. A baboon may help an unrelated companion in a fight, or a wolf may offer food to another wolf even though they share no kinship. Such behavior can be adaptive if the aided individual returns the favor in the future. This sort of exchange of aid is called reciprocal altruism and is commonly invoked to explain altruism in humans. Reciprocal altruism is rare in other animals; it is limited largely to species with social groups stable enough that individuals have many chances to exchange aid. It is likely that all behavior that seems altruistic actually has at least the potential to increase fitness in some way.





 Sociobiology connects evolutionary theory to human culture

Recall that the main premise of sociobiology is that certain behavioral characteristics exist because they are expressions of genes that have been perpetuated by natural selection. In the last chapter of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, E. O. Wilson speculated about the evolutionary basis of certain kinds of social behavior, including culture, in humans. The debate about the connection between biological evolution and human culture remains heated today.

The spectrum of possible human social behaviors may be circumscribed by our genetic potential, but this is very different from saying that genes are rigid determinants of behavior. This is at the core of the debate about sociobiology. Opponents fear that a sociobiological interpretation of human behavior can be used to justify the status quo in human society, thus rationalizing current social injustices. Sociobiologists argue that this is a gross oversimplification and misunderstanding of what the data tell us about human biology. Sociobiology does not reduce us to robots stamped out of rigid genetic molds. Individuals vary extensively in anatomical features, and we should expect inherent variations in behavior as well. Furthermore, though we are locked into our genotypes, our nervous systems are not "hardwired." Environment intervenes in the pathway from genotype to phenotype for physical traits and even more so for behavioral traits. And because of our capacity for learning and versatility, human behavior is probably more plastic than that of any other animal. Over our recent evolutionary history, we have built up a diversity of structured societies with governments, laws, cultural values, and religions that define what is acceptable behavior and what is not, even when unacceptable behavior might enhance an individual's Darwinian fitness. Perhaps it is our social and cultural institutions that make us truly unique and that provide the only feature in which there is no continuum between humans and other animals (FIGURE 51.32).

Fig 51-32. Both genes and culture build human nature. Teaching of the younger generation by the older is one of the basic ways in which all cultures are transmitted. Sociobiologists see mentoring as an innate tendency with adaptive value that has evolved in the human species.

In this chapter, we have examined the role of behavior in the relationship between animals and their environment. We have focused on the proximate mechanisms underlying behavior and on how particular behavior patterns contribute to an animal's survival and reproductive success. In studying an animal's behavior, we are watching it perform on an ecological stage, a setting where evolution by natural selection determines which individuals contribute the greatest number of genes to a population's gene pool. In the next chapter, we take a closer look at populations as ecological and evolutionary units.

HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH

   The human population has been growing almost exponentially for three centuries but cannot do so indefinitely

   Estimating Earth's carrying capacity for humans is a complex problem

The size and activities of the human population are now among Earth's most significant problems. With a population of over 6 billion individuals, our species requires vast amounts of materials and space, including places to live, land to grow our food, and places to dump our waste. Endlessly expanding our presence on Earth, we have devastated the environment for many other species and now threaten to make it unfit for ourselves.

To understand human population growth, we must consider the general principles of population ecology. It is obvious that no population can continue to grow indefinitely. Species other than humans sometimes exhibit population explosions, but their populations inevitably decline. In contrast to these radical booms and busts, many populations are relatively stable over time, with only minor changes in population size.

In our earlier study of biological populations (see Chapter 23), we emphasized the relationship between population genetics--the structure and dynamics of gene pools--and evolution. Evolution remains our central theme as we now view populations in the context of ecology. Population ecology, the subject of this chapter, is concerned with measuring changes in population size and composition, and with identifying the ecological causes of these fluctuations. Later in this chapter, we will return to our discussion of the human population. Let's first examine some of the structural and dynamic aspects of populations as they apply to any species, such as the monarch butterfly population in the photo on this page.





CHARACTERISTICS OF POPULATIONS

 

 Two important characteristics of any population are density and the spacing of individuals



 

 Demography is the study of factors that affect the growth and decline of populations



A population is a group of individuals of a single species that simultaneously occupy the same general area. They rely on the same resources, are influenced by similar environmental factors, and have a high likelihood of breeding with and interacting with one another. The characteristics of a population are shaped by interactions between individuals and their environments, and natural selection can modify these characteristics.





LIFE HISTORIES

 

 Life histories are highly diverse, but they exhibit patterns in their variability



 

 Limited resources mandate trade-offs between investments in reproduction and survival



Natural selection will favor traits in organisms that improve their chances of survival and reproductive success. Organisms that survive a long time but do not reproduce are not at all "fit" in the Darwinian sense. In every species, there are trade-offs between survival and traits such as frequency of reproduction, investment in parental care, and the number of offspring produced (seed crops for seed plants and litter size or clutch size for animals). The traits that affect an organism's schedule of reproduction and survival (from birth through reproduction to death) make up its life history. Of course, a particular life history, like most characteristics of an organism, is the result of natural selection operating over evolutionary time. Life history traits help determine how populations grow.





POPULATION GROWTH

 

 The exponential model of population growth describes an idealized population in an unlimited environment



 

 The logistic model of population growth incorporates the concept of carrying capacity



To begin to understand the potential for population increase, consider a single bacterium that can reproduce by fission every 20 minutes under ideal laboratory conditions. At the end of this time, there would be two bacteria, four after 40 minutes, and so on. If this continued for only a day and a half--a mere 36 hours--there would be enough bacteria to form a layer a foot deep over the entire Earth. At the other life history extreme, elephants may produce only six young in a 100-year life span. Still, Darwin calculated that it would take only 750 years for a single pair of elephants to produce a population of 19 million. Obviously, indefinite population increase does not occur for any species, either in the laboratory or in nature. A population that begins at a low level in a favorable environment may increase rapidly for a while, but eventually the numbers must, as a result of limited resources and other factors, stop growing.

As we discussed in Chapter 50, finding the answers to ecological questions depends on a combination of observation and experimentation. The two major forces affecting population growth--birth rates and death rates--can be measured in many populations and used to predict how the populations will change in size over time. Small organisms can be studied in the laboratory to determine how various factors affect their population growth rates, and natural populations can be experimentally manipulated to answer the same questions. Mathematical models can be used for testing hypotheses about the effects of different factors on population growth once we understand how birth and death rates change over time. We can begin to understand population growth by looking at a few simple models of how a population can grow.





POPULATION-LIMITING FACTORS

 

 Negative feedback prevents unlimited population growth



 

 Population dynamics reflect a complex interaction of biotic and abiotic influences



 

 Some populations have regular boom-and-bust cycles



There are two general questions that we can ask about population growth. First, why do all populations eventually stop increasing? Exponential population growth is rare in nature and always of short duration. What environmental factors stop a population from growing? If we have an introduced weed that is spreading rapidly, what should we do to stop its population growth? Second, why is the population density of a particular species greater in some habitats than in others? Every bird-watcher can tell you what the favorable and unfavorable habitats are for any particular bird species. What determines a favorable habitat, and how do we turn an unfavorable habitat into a good one?

These questions have many practical applications. A conservation biologist might want to turn a declining species population into an increasing one. And in agriculture, the objective may be to get a pest population to decrease. Moreover, agricultural pests may have severe effects in some areas and negligible effects in others. Why? Endangered species, meanwhile, such as humpback whales, require good habitats for survival. What environmental factors create a favorable feeding habitat for humpbacks? All these practical issues involve population-limiting factors. Regulation is one of this book's ten themes (see Chapter 1). In this section, we apply that theme to populations.

The first step in understanding why a population stops growing is to find out how the rates of birth, death, immigration, and emigration change as population density rises. If immigration and emigration offset each other, then a population grows when the birth rate exceeds the death rate and declines when the death rate exceeds the birth rate. FIGURE 52.13 shows a simple graphical model of how a population may stop increasing and reach equilibrium. A death rate that rises as population density rises is said to be density dependent, as is a birth rate that falls with rising density. Density-dependent rates are an example of negative feedback, a type of regulation you learned about in Chapter 1. In contrast, a birth rate or death rate that does not change with population density is said to be density independent. With density-independent rates, there is no feedback to slow down population growth.

Fig 52-13. Graphic model showing how equilibrium may be determined for population density. Population density reaches equilibrium only when the per capita birth rate equals the per capita death rate, and this is possible only if the birth or death rate (or both) changes with density (is a density-dependent rate). In this simple model, immigration and emigration are assumed to be either zero or equal.





HUMAN POPULATION GROWTH

 

 The human population has been growing almost exponentially for three centuries but cannot do so indefinitely



 

 Estimating Earth's carrying capacity for humans is a complex problem



Humans are not exempt from natural processes. No population, including the human population, can grow indefinitely. In this last section of the chapter, we'll apply what we've learned about population dynamics to the specific case of the human population.

The explosive growth of the human population, coupled with massive consumption of the planet's resources by developed nations, is the primary cause of severe environmental degradation and the loss of biological species. Many of the environmental problems that we now confront cannot be solved without thoughtful regulation of our numbers. Population regulation in humans is a controversial issue, and we need to understand clearly the biological basis of our current problems before we can search for solutions.





 Two important characteristics of any population are density and the spacing of individuals

At any given moment, every population has geographic boundaries and a population size (the number of individuals it includes). Ecologists begin studying a population by defining boundaries appropriate to the organisms under study and to the questions being posed. A population's boundaries may be natural ones, such as a specific island in Lake Superior where terns nest, or they may be arbitrarily defined by an investigator, such as the oak trees within a specific county in Minnesota. Regardless of such differences, two important characteristics of any population are its density and its dispersion. Population density is the number of individuals per unit area or volume--the number of oak trees per square kilometer in the Minnesota county, for example. Dispersion is the pattern of spacing among individuals within the geographic boundaries of the population.

Measuring Density

In rare cases, it is possible to determine population size and density by actually counting all individuals within the boundaries of the population. We could count the number of sea stars in a tide pool, for example. Herds of large mammals, such as buffalo or elephants, can sometimes be counted accurately from airplanes (FIGURE 52.1). In most cases, however, it is impractical or impossible to count all individuals in a population. Instead, ecologists use a variety of sampling techniques to estimate densities and total population sizes. For example, they might estimate the number of alligators in the Florida Everglades by counting individuals in a few randomly chosen plots. Or they might count the numbers of oak trees in several randomly placed circular plots of 10-m diameter. Such estimates are more accurate when there are many sample plots and when the habitat is homogeneous.

Fig 52-1. Aerial census for African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Serengeti of East Africa. Biologists can count large mammals and birds in open habitats from the air, either directly or from photographs like this one. By repeating these counts over many years, researchers can track population trends.

One sampling technique researchers often use to estimate fish and wildlife populations is the mark-recapture method. Traps are placed within the boundaries of the study area, and captured animals are marked with tags, collars, bands, or spots of dye and then immediately released. After a few days or a few weeks--enough time for the marked animals to mix randomly with unmarked members of the population--traps are set again. The proportion of marked (recaptured) animals in the second trapping is assumed equivalent to the proportion of marked animals in the total population: 

Thus, if there have been no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration, the following proportionality provides an estimate of the population size N: 

For example, suppose that 50 snowshoe hares are captured in box traps, marked with ear tags, and released. Two weeks later, 100 hares are captured and checked for ear tags. If 10 hares in this second catch are already marked and thus are recaptures, we would estimate that 10%  of the total hare population is marked. Since 50 hares were originally marked, the entire population would be about 500 hares. This method assumes that each marked individual has the same probability of being trapped as each unmarked individual. This is not always a safe assumption, however. An animal that has been caught once may become wary of the traps later on or may learn to return to traps to eat the food used as bait.

In some cases, instead of counting individual organisms, population ecologists estimate density from some index of population size. This usually involves counting signs left by organisms, such as the number of nests, burrows, tracks, or fecal droppings.

Patterns of Dispersion

Within a population's geographic range, local densities may vary substantially because the environment is patchy (not all areas provide equally suitable habitat) and because individuals exhibit patterns of spacing in relation to other members of the population.

The most common pattern of dispersion is clumped, with the individuals aggregated in patches. Plants may be clumped in certain sites where soil conditions and other environmental factors favor germination and growth. The eastern red cedar is often found clumped on limestone outcrops, where soil is less acidic than in nearby areas. Mushrooms may be clumped on a rotting log. Some animals move in herds (see FIGURE 52.1). Animals often spend much of their time in a particular micro-environment that satisfies their requirements. For example, many forest insects and salamanders are clumped under logs, where the humidity remains high. Herbivorous animals of a particular species are likely to be most abundant where their food plants are concentrated. Clumping of animals may also be associated with mating behavior. For example, mayflies often swarm in great numbers, a behavior that increases mating chances for these insects, which spend only a day or two as reproductive adults. There may also be "safety in numbers"; fish swimming in large schools, for example, are often less likely to be eaten by predators than fish swimming alone or in small groups (FIGURE 52.2a).

Fig 52-2. Patterns of dispersion within a population's geographic range.

In contrast to a clumped distribution of individuals within a population, a uniform, or evenly spaced, pattern of dispersion may result from direct interactions between individuals in the population. For example, a tendency toward regular spacing of plants may be due to shading and competition for water and minerals; some plants also secrete chemicals that inhibit the germination and growth of nearby individuals that could compete for resources. Animals often exhibit uniform dispersion as a result of territorial behavior and aggressive social interactions (FIGURE 52.2b). Uniform patterns are not as common in populations as clumped patterns.

Random spacing (unpredictable dispersion) occurs in the absence of strong attractions or repulsions among individuals of a population; the position of each individual is independent of other individuals. For example, trees in a forest are sometimes randomly distributed (FIGURE 52.2c). Random patterns are not as common in nature as one might expect; most populations show at least a tendency toward a clumped distribution.





 Demography is the study of factors that affect the growth and decline of populations

Changes in population size reflect the relative rates of processes that add individuals to the population and eliminate individuals from it. Additions occur through births (which we will define here to include all forms of reproduction) and immigration, the influx of new individuals from other areas. Opposing these additions are mortality (death) and emigration, the movement of individuals out of a population. Our focus in this chapter is primarily on factors that influence birth rates and death rates, but you should remember that immigration and emigration may also play a role in population dynamics.

The study of the vital statistics that affect population size is called demography. Birth rates vary among individuals (specifically, among females) within a population, depending, in particular, on age; and death rates depend on both age and sex. Let's see how these demographic variables affect population dynamics.

Life Tables and Survivorship Curves

About a century ago, when life insurance first became available, insurance companies developed an interest in the mathematics of survival. They needed to estimate how long, on average, an individual of a given age could be expected to live. Some of the greatest demographers of the past century worked for life insurance companies. They invented demographic representations called life tables. A life table is an age-specific summary of the survival pattern of a population. Population ecologists adapted this approach for nonhuman populations and developed quantitative demography as a branch of biology.

The best way to construct a life table is to follow the fate of a cohort, a group of individuals of the same age, from birth until all are dead. The table is constructed from the number of individuals that die in each age-group during the defined time period. Cohort life tables are difficult to collect on wild animals and plants and are available only for a limited number of species.

TABLE 52.1 is a life table for a cohort of Belding ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) at Tioga Pass, in California. Much can be learned about a population from a life table. The third column in the table shows the proportion of individuals in a cohort that are still alive at a given age. Notice that the death rates are generally highest among the youngest ground squirrels and among the oldest individuals and that males suffer higher rates of loss than females.

W. Sherman and M. L. Morton, "Demography of Belding's Ground Squirrel,"Ecology 65(1984): 1617-1628.A graphic way of representing the data in a life table is to draw a survivorship curve, a plot of the proportion or numbers in a cohort still alive at each age (FIGURE 52.3). Survivorship curves can be classified into three general types. A Type I curve is relatively flat at the start, reflecting low death rates during early and middle life, then drops steeply as death rates increase among older age-groups. Humans and many other large mammals that produce relatively few offspring but provide them with good care often exhibit this kind of curve. In contrast, a Type III curve drops sharply at the left of the graph, reflecting very high death rates for the young, but then flattens out as death rates decline for those few individuals that have survived to a certain critical age. This type of curve is usually associated with organisms that produce very large numbers of offspring but provide little or no care, such as many fishes and marine invertebrates. An oyster, for example, may release millions of eggs, but most offspring die as larvae from predation or other causes. Those few that manage to survive long enough to attach to a suitable substrate and begin growing a hard shell, however, will probably survive for a relatively long time. Type II curves are intermediate, with a constant death rate over the life span. This kind of survivorship occurs in some annual plants, various invertebrates such as Hydra, some lizard species, and some rodents, such as the gray squirrel.

Fig 52-3. Idealized survivorship curves. As an example of a Type I curve, humans in developed countries experience high survival rates until old age. At the opposite extreme are Type III curves for organisms such as oysters, which experience very high mortality as larvae but decreased mortality later in life. Type II survivorship curves are intermediate between the other two types and result when a constant proportion of individuals die at each age. Notice that the y axis is logarithmic and that the x axis is on a relative scale, so that species with widely varying life spans can be compared on the same graph.

Many species, of course, fall somewhere between these basic types of survivorship or show more complex patterns. In birds, for example, mortality is often high among the youngest individuals (as in a Type III curve) but fairly constant among adults (as in a Type II curve). Some invertebrates, such as crabs, may show a "stair-stepped" curve, with brief periods of increased mortality during molts (caused by physiological problems or greater vulnerability to predation), followed by periods of lower mortality (when the exoskeleton is hard).

In populations without immigration or emigration, survivorship is one of the two key factors determining changes in population size. Next we consider reproductive output, the other key factor determining population trends.

Reproductive Rates

Demographers who study sexually reproducing species generally ignore males and concentrate on females in the population because only females give birth to offspring. Demographers view populations in terms of females giving rise to new females; males are important only as distributors of genes. How can we describe the reproductive program of a population? The simplest way is to follow the basic approach of the life table and ask how reproductive output varies with age.

A reproductive table, or fertility schedule, is an age- specific summary of the reproductive rates in a population. The best way to construct a fertility schedule is to measure the reproductive output of a cohort from birth until death. For sexual species, the reproductive table tallies the number of female offspring produced by each age-group. TABLE 52.2 illustrates a reproductive table for Belding ground squirrels. Reproductive output for sexual species like birds and mammals is a product of the fraction of females of a given age that are breeding and the number of female offspring of those breeding females. By multiplying these together, we can obtain the average output of daughters for each individual in a given age class (the last column in TABLE 52.1). For these ground squirrels, which begin to reproduce at age 1 year, reproductive output rises to a peak at 4 years of age and then falls off in older females.

W. Sherman and M. L. Morton, "Demography of Belding's Ground Squirrel,"Ecology 65(1984): 1617-1628.Reproductive tables vary greatly, depending on the species. Squirrels have a litter of two to six young once a year, whereas oak trees drop thousands of acorns each year for tens or hundreds of years. Salmon lay thousands of eggs when they spawn, and mussels and other invertebrates may release hundreds of thousands of eggs in a spawning cycle. Why does one type of life cycle rather than another evolve in a particular population? This is one of the many questions at the interface of population ecology and evolutionary biology.





 Life histories are highly diverse, but they exhibit patterns in their variability

Because of varying environmental contexts for natural selection, life histories are very diverse. Pacific salmon, for example, hatch in the headwaters of a stream, then migrate to open ocean, where they require one to four years to mature. They eventually return to freshwater streams to spawn, producing thousands of small eggs in a single reproductive opportunity, and then they die. Ecologists call this big-bang reproduction. FIGURE 52.4 illustrates big-bang reproduction in agaves. The agave, or century plant, grows in arid climates with sparse and unpredictable rainfall. Agaves grow vegetatively for several years, then send up a large flowering stalk, produce seeds, and die. (We introduced the big-bang reproduction of century plants on the opening page of Chapter 38.) The shallow roots of agaves catch water after rain showers but are dry during droughts. This unpredictable water supply may prevent seed production or seedling establishment for several years at a time. By growing and storing nutrients until an unusually wet year and then putting all its resources into reproduction, the agave's big-bang strategy is a life history adaptation to erratic climate. In another example of big-bang reproduction, annual desert wildflowers generally germinate, grow, produce many small seeds, and then die, all in the span of a month after spring rains. Big-bang (one-time) reproduction is also called semelparity (from the Latin semel, once, and parito, to beget).

Fig 52-4. An example of big-bang reproduction. Agaves, or century plants, grow without reproducing for several years and then produce a gigantic flowering stalk and many seeds. After this onetime reproductive effort, the plant dies.

In contrast to big-bang reproduction, some lizards produce only a few large eggs during their second year of life, then repeat the reproductive act annually for several years. And some species of oaks do not reproduce until the tree is 20 years old, but then produce vast numbers of large seeds each year for a century or more. Ecologists call this repeated reproduction or iteroparity (from the Latin itero, to repeat).

What factors contribute to the evolution of semelparity versus iteroparity? That is, how much will an individual gain in reproductive success through one strategy versus the other? The key demographic effect of big-bang reproduction is higher reproductive rates. Plants like agaves that reproduce only once typically produce two to five times as many seeds as closely related species that reproduce repeatedly. The critical factor in the evolutionary dilemma of big-bang versus repeated reproduction is the survival rate of the offspring. If their chance of survival is poor or inconsistent, repeated reproduction will be favored.





 Limited resources mandate trade-offs between investments in reproduction and survival

Darwinian fitness is measured not by how many offspring are produced but by how many survive to produce their own offspring: Heritable characteristics of life history that result in the most reproductively successful descendants will become more common within the population. If we were to construct a hypothetical life history that would yield the greatest lifetime reproductive output, we might imagine a population of individuals that begin reproducing at an early age, produce many offspring each time they reproduce, and reproduce many times in a lifetime. However, natural selection cannot maximize all these variables simultaneously, because organisms have finite resources, and limited resources mean trade-offs. Ecologists who study the evolution of life histories focus on how these trade-offs operate in specific populations. For example, the production of many offspring with little chance of survival may result in fewer descendants than the production of a few well-cared-for offspring that can compete vigorously for limited resources in an already dense population.

The life histories we observe in organisms represent an evolutionary resolution of several conflicting demands. Time, energy, and nutrients that are used for one thing cannot be used for something else. In the broadest sense, there is a trade-off between reproduction and survival, and this has been demonstrated by several studies. For example, in red deer on the Scottish island of Rhum, females that reproduce in one summer suffer higher mortality over the following winter than do females that did not reproduce (FIGURE 52.5). This cost of reproduction was found even in red deer in the prime of life, but was particularly severe in the older females. And in many insect species, females that lay fewer eggs live longer, suggesting a similar trade-off between investing in current reproduction and survival. There can also be trade-offs between current and future reproduction. When perennial plants produce more seeds in one year, they grow less and have reduced seed production the next year. Moreover, experimental transfers of eggs or nestlings in bird populations have measured the trade-off between reproductive effort and survival. When nestlings of European kestrels were transferred among nests to produce broods of three or four (reduced), five or six (normal), and seven or eight (enlarged), adult kestrels that raised the enlarged broods survived poorly over the following winter (FIGURE 52.6).

Fig 52-6. Probability of survival over the following year for European kestrels after raising a modified brood. A total of 200 birds were studied from 1985 to 1990 in the Netherlands. Adults with experimentally enlarged broods die more often over the following winter. (Both males and females provide parental care for the nestlings.)

As in our red deer and kestrel examples, many life history issues involve balancing the profit of immediate investment in offspring against the cost to future prospects of survival and reproduction. These issues can be summarized by three basic "decisions": when to begin reproducing, how often to breed, and how many offspring to produce during each reproductive episode. The various "choices" are integrated into the life history patterns we see in nature. It is important to clarify our use of the word choice. Organisms do not choose consciously when to breed and how many offspring to have. (Humans are an important exception we will consider later in the chapter.) Life history traits are evolutionary outcomes reflected in the development, physiology, and behavior of an organism. Age at maturity and the number of offspring produced during a given reproductive episode are usually maintained within narrow ranges by stabilizing selection (see Chapter 23). Natural selection molds reproductive patterns in populations; such patterns are not consciously chosen by the organism.

As with all life history adaptations, the number and size of offspring depend on the selective pressures under which the organism evolved. Plants and animals whose young are subject to high mortality rates often produce large numbers of relatively small offspring (FIGURE 52.7a). Thus, plants that colonize disturbed environments usually produce many small seeds, most of which will not reach a suitable environment. Small size might actually benefit such seeds if it enables them to be carried long distances. Birds and mammals that suffer high predation rates also produce large numbers of offspring; examples include quail, rabbits, and mice. In other organisms, extra investment on the part of the parent greatly increases the offspring's chances of survival. Oak, walnut, and coconut trees all have large seeds with a large store of energy and nutrients that the seedlings can use to become established (FIGURE 52.7b). In animals, parental investment in offspring does not always end with incubation or gestation. Primates generally have only one or two offspring at a time. Parental care and an extended period of learning in the first several years of life are very important to offspring fitness in these mammals.

Fig 52-7. Variation in seed crop size in plants. (a) Most weedy plants, such as this dandelion, grow quickly and produce a large number of seeds. Although most of the seeds will not produce mature plants, their large number and ability to disperse to new habitats ensure that at least some will grow and eventually produce seeds themselves. (b) Some plants, such as this coconut palm, produce a moderate number of very large seeds. The large endosperm provides nutrients for the embryo (a plant's version of parental care), an adaptation that helps ensure the success of a relatively large fraction of offspring. Animal species exhibit similar trade-offs between number of offspring and the amount of nutrients provided to each offspring.

Now that we have analyzed some patterns that underlie diverse life histories, let's examine the effects of these life history traits on the growth of populations.





 The exponential model of population growth describes an idealized population in an unlimited environment

Imagine a hypothetical population consisting of a few individuals living in an ideal, unlimited environment. Under these conditions, there are no restrictions on the abilities of individuals to harvest energy, grow, and reproduce, aside from the inherent physiological limitations that are the result of their life history. The population will increase in size with every birth and with the immigration of individuals from other populations and decrease in size with every death and with the emigration of individuals out of the population. For simplicity, let's ignore the effects of immigration and emigration (a more complex formulation would certainly include these factors). We can define a change in population size during a fixed time interval with the following verbal equation: 

Using mathematical notation, we can express this relationship more concisely. If N represents population size and t represents time, then DN is the change in population size and Dt is the time interval (appropriate to the life span or generation time of the species) over which we are evaluating population growth. (The Greek letter delta, D, indicates change, such as change in time.) We can now rewrite the verbal equation as 

where B is the number of births in the population during the time interval and D is the number of deaths.

We can now convert the simple model just presented into one in which births and deaths are expressed as the average number of births and deaths per individual during the specified time interval. Let b represent the per capita birth rate, the number of offspring produced per unit time by an average member of the population. If, for example, a population of 1,000 individuals experiences 34 births per year, then the annual per capita birth rate is 34/1000, or 0.034. If we know the per capita birth rate and death rate, we can calculate the expected number of births and deaths in a population of any size. For example, if we know that the annual per capita birth rate is 0.034 and the population size is 500, we can use the formula B = bN to calculate the number of births expected in that population per year: 

Similarly, the per capita death rate, symbolized as d, allows us to calculate the expected number of deaths per unit time in a population of any size. If d = 0.016 per year, we would expect 16 deaths per year in a population of 1,000 individuals. (Using the formula D = dN, how many deaths would you expect per year if d = 0.010 annually in populations of 500, 700, and 1,700?) For natural populations or those in the laboratory, the per capita birth rates and death rates can be calculated from estimates of population size and data given in life tables and reproductive tables (see, for example, TABLE 52.1andTABLE 52.2).

We can revise the population growth equation again, this time using per capita birth rates and death rates rather than the numbers of births and deaths: 

One final simplification is in order. Population ecologists are concerned with overall changes in population size, using r to identify the difference in the per capita birth rates and death rates: 

This value, the per capita growth rate, tells whether a population is actually growing (positive value of r) or declining (negative value of r). Zero population growth (ZPG) occurs when the per capita birth rates and death rates are equal (r = 0). Note that births and deaths still occur in the population, but they balance each other exactly. (Later in this chapter, we will discuss the relevance of ZPG for the human population and the factors preventing the human population from leveling off.)

Using the per capita growth rate, we rewrite the equation for change in population size as 

Finally, most ecologists use the notation of differential calculus to express population growth in terms of instantaneous growth rates: 

If you have not yet studied calculus, don't be intimidated by the form of the last equation; it is essentially the same as the previous one, except that the time intervals Dt are very short and are expressed in the equation as dt. (Do not confuse this use of d to symbolize very small change with our earlier use of d to represent per capita death rate.)

We started this section by describing a population living under ideal conditions, where organisms are constrained only by their life history. In such a situation, the population grows rapidly, because all members have access to abundant food and are free to reproduce at their physiological capacity. Population increase under these ideal conditions is called exponential population growth, or geometric population growth. Under these conditions the per capita growth rate may assume the maximum growth rate for the species, called the intrinsic rate of increase, denoted as rmax. And the equation for exponential population growth is then: 

The size of a population that is growing exponentially increases rapidly, resulting in a J-shaped growth curve when population size is plotted over time (FIGURE 52.8). Although the intrinsic rate of increase is constant as the population grows, the population actually accumulates more new individuals per unit of time when it is large than when it is small; thus, the curves in FIGURE 52.8 get progressively steeper over time. This occurs because population growth depends on N as well as r, and larger populations experience more births (and deaths) than small ones growing at the same per capita rate. It is also clear from FIGURE 52.8 that a population with a higher intrinsic rate of increase (dN/dt = 1.0N) will grow faster than one with a lower rate of increase (dN/dt 5 = 0.5N).

Fig 52-8. Population growth predicted by the exponential model. The exponential growth model predicts unlimited population increase under conditions of unlimited resources. This graph compares growth in populations with two different values of r: 1.0 and 0.5.

The J-shaped curve of exponential growth is characteristic of some populations that are introduced into a new or unfilled environment or whose numbers have been drastically reduced by a catastrophic event and are rebounding. For example, FIGURE 52.9 illustrates exponential population growth in the whooping crane, an endangered species now recovering from the impact of habitat loss due to agriculture.

Fig 52-9. Example of exponential population growth in nature. The whooping crane is an endangered species that has been recovering from near extinction since 1940. Counts of adults are made annually on the wintering grounds at Aransas, Texas. In the year 2000-2001, there were 179 birds in the wintering population in Texas, the population having declined slightly from the preceding year. The overall average rate of increase has been 4%  per year since the 1950s.





 The logistic model of population growth incorporates the concept of carrying capacity

The exponential growth model assumes unlimited resources, which is never the case in the real world. No population--neither bacteria nor elephants nor any other organisms--can grow exponentially indefinitely. As any population grows larger in size, its increased density may influence the ability of individuals to harvest sufficient resources for maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Populations subsist on a finite amount of available resources, and as the population becomes more crowded, each individual has access to an increasingly smaller share. Ultimately, there is a limit to the number of individuals that can occupy a habitat. Ecologists define carrying capacity as the maximum population size that a particular environment can support at a particular time with no degradation of the habitat. Carrying capacity, symbolized as K, is not fixed, but varies over space and time with the abundance of limiting resources. For example, the carrying capacity for bats may be high in a habitat where flying insects are abundant and there are caves for roosting but lower in a habitat where food is abundant but suitable shelters are less common. Energy limitation is one of the most significant determinants of carrying capacity, although other factors, such as shelters, refuges from predators, soil nutrients, water, and suitable nesting and roosting sites, can be limiting.

Crowding and resource limitation can have a profound effect on the population growth rate. If individuals cannot obtain sufficient resources to reproduce, per capita birth rate will decline. If they cannot find and consume enough energy to maintain themselves, per capita death rates may also increase. A decrease in b or an increase in d results in a smaller r and a lower overall rate of population growth.

The Logistic Growth Equation

We can modify our mathematical model of population growth to incorporate changes in growth rate as the population size nears the carrying capacity (as N grows toward K). The logistic population growth model incorporates the effect of population density on the per capita rate of increase, allowing this rate to vary from a maximum at low population size to zero as carrying capacity is reached. When a population's size is below the carrying capacity, population growth is rapid, but as N approaches K, population growth slows down.

Mathematically, we construct the logistic model by starting with the model of exponential population growth and creating an expression that reduces the rate of population increase as N increases (FIGURE 52.10). If the maximum sustainable population size is K, then K-N tells us how many additional individuals the environment can accommodate, and (K-N)/K tells us what fraction of K is still available for population growth. By multiplying the exponential rate of increase rmaxN by (K-N)/K, we reduce the actual growth rate of the population as N increases:

Fig 52-10. Reduction of population growth rate with increasing population size (N). The logistic model of population growth assumes that the population growth rate dN/dt decreases as N increases. When N is close to 0, the population grows rapidly. However, as N approaches K (the carrying capacity of the environment), the population growth rate approaches 0, and population growth slows. If N is greater than K, then the population growth rate is negative, and population size decreases. An equilibrium is reached at the white line when N = K.

TABLE 52.3 shows hypothetical calculations for the rate of population increase and changes in N at various population sizes for a population growing according to the logistic model. Notice that when N is small compared to K, the term (K-N)/K is large, and the actual rate of population increase (dN/dt) is close to the intrinsic (maximum) rate of increase. But when N is large and resources are limiting, then (K-N)/K is small, and so is the rate of population increase. Zero population growth occurs when the numbers of births and deaths are equal--when N equals K.

New individuals are added to the population most rapidly at intermediate population sizes, when there is not only a breeding population of substantial size, but also lots of available space and other resources in the environment. The population growth rate slows dramatically as N approaches K.

Fig 52-11. Population growth predicted by the logistic model. The logistic growth model assumes that there is a maximum population size that the environment can support--the carrying capacity K. The rate of population growth slows as the population approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. The red line shows logistic growth in a population where rmax = 1.0 and K = 1,500 individuals. For comparison, the blue line illustrates a population continuing to grow exponentially with the same rmax.

Notice that we haven't said anything about what makes the population growth rate change as N approaches K. Either the birth rate b must decrease, the death rate d must increase, or both. Later in the chapter, we will go into some detail about some of the factors affecting b and d.

How Well Does the Logistic Model Fit the Growth of Real Populations?

The growth of laboratory populations of some small animals, such as beetles or crustaceans, and of microorganisms, such as paramecia, yeasts, and bacteria, fit S-shaped curves fairly well (FIGURE 52.12a, page 1162). These experimental populations are grown in a constant environment lacking predators and other species that may compete for resources, conditions that rarely occur in nature. Even under these laboratory conditions, not all populations show logistic growth patterns. Laboratory populations of water fleas (Daphnia), for example, show exponential growth and overshoot their carrying capacity before settling down to a relatively stable density (FIGURE 52.12b).

Fig 52-12. How well do these populations fit the logistic population growth model? The dots on these graphs are the actual data points.

Most populations show some deviations from a smooth sigmoid curve. And while many natural populations increase in approximately logistic fashion, the stable carrying capacity is rarely observed. FIGURE 52.12c shows population changes in the song sparrow on a small island in southern British Columbia. The population increases rapidly but suffers periodic catastrophes in winter, so that there is no stable population size.

Some of the basic assumptions built into the logistic model clearly do not apply to all populations. For example, the model incorporates the idea that even at low population levels, each individual added to the population has the same negative effect on population growth rate. Some populations, however, show an Allee effect (named after W. C. Allee, of the University of Chicago, who first described it), in which individuals may have a more difficult time surviving or reproducing if the population size is too small. For example, a single plant standing alone may suffer from excessive wind but would be protected in a clump of individuals. And some seabirds that breed in colonies require large numbers at their breeding grounds to provide the necessary social stimulation for reproduction. Moreover, conservation biologists fear that populations of solitary animals, such as rhinoceroses, may become so small that individuals will not be able to locate mates in the breeding season. In all these cases, a greater number of individuals in the population has a positive effect, up to a point, on population growth, rather than a negative effect as assumed by the logistic model.

The logistic model also makes the assumption that populations adjust instantaneously and approach carrying capacity smoothly. In most natural populations, however, there is a lag time before the negative effects of an increasing population are realized. For example, as some important resource, such as food, becomes limiting for a population, reproduction will be reduced, but the birth rate may not be affected immediately because the organisms may use their energy reserves to continue producing eggs for a short time. This may cause the population to overshoot the carrying capacity. Eventually, deaths will exceed births, and the population may then drop below carrying capacity; even though reproduction begins again as numbers fall, there is a delay until new individuals actually appear. Many populations fluctuate strongly, which makes it difficult to define what is meant by carrying capacity (see FIGURE 52.12c). Others overshoot it at least once before attaining a relatively stable size (see FIGURE 52.12b). We will examine some possible reasons for these fluctuations later in the chapter.

As you will see in the next section, some populations do not necessarily remain at, or even reach, levels where population density is an important factor. In many insects and other small, quickly reproducing organisms that are sensitive to environmental fluctuations, physical variables such as temperature or moisture usually reduce the population well before resources become limiting.

Overall, the logistic model is a useful starting point for thinking about how populations grow and for constructing more complex models. Although it fits few, if any, real populations closely, the logistic model is useful in conservation biology and in pest control to estimate how rapidly a particular population might increase in numbers after it has been reduced to a small size. And like any good starting hypothesis, the logistic model has stimulated much research and many discussions that, whether they support the model or not, lead to a greater understanding of the factors affecting population growth.

The Logistic Population Growth Model and Life Histories

The logistic model predicts different growth rates for low-density populations and high-density populations, relative to the carrying capacity of the environment. At high densities, each individual has few resources available, and the population can grow slowly, if at all. At low densities, the opposite is true: Resources per capita are relatively abundant, and the population can grow rapidly. Different life history features will be favored under these different conditions. At high population density, selection favors adaptations that enable organisms to survive and reproduce with few resources. Thus, competitive ability and maximum efficiency of resource utilization should be favored in populations that are at or near their carrying capacity. At low population density, on the other hand, even in the same species, the "empty" environment should favor adaptations that promote rapid reproduction. Increased fecundity and earlier maturity, for example, would be selected for.

Thus, the life history traits that natural selection favors may vary with population density and environmental conditions. Selection for life history traits that are sensitive to population density can be called K-selection, or density-dependent selection. In contrast, selection for life history traits that maximize reproductive success in uncrowded environments (low densities) can be called r-selection, or density-independent selection. These names follow from the variables of the logistic equation. K-selection tends to maximize population size and operates in populations living at a density near the limit imposed by their resources (the carrying capacity K). By contrast, r-selection tends to maximize r, the rate of increase, and occurs in variable environments in which population densities fluctuate well below carrying capacity or in open habitats where individuals are likely to face little competition.

In laboratory experiments, researchers have shown that different populations of the same species may show a different balance of K-selected and r-selected traits, depending on conditions. For example, cultures of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster raised under crowded conditions with minimal food for 200 generations are more productive at high density than populations raised in uncrowded conditions with maximal food. Larvae from cultures selected for living in crowded conditions feed faster than larvae selected for living in uncrowded cultures. The fruit fly genotypes that are most fit at low density do not have high fitness at high density, as predicted by r- and K- selection theory.





 Negative feedback prevents unlimited population growth

No population stops growing without some type of negative feedback between population density and the vital rates of birth and death. Once we know how birth and death rates change with population density, we need to determine the mechanisms causing these changes. Because populations are affected by a variety of factors that cause negative feedback, it can be a challenge to pinpoint the exact factors at work in a particular population.

Although field studies may eventually shed light on the most important factors producing negative feedback in specific cases, they have not yet provided many generalizations. First, much of the research on populations has been conducted in the temperate zone, and we need many more studies of tropical and polar organisms to complete the picture. Second, birds and mammals have been the subjects of much more research than have other organisms. In particular, insects, which form the dominant group of species on Earth, have not been studied in proportion to their species' richness. Finally, long time periods are required for experimental work on population dynamics, with definitive studies routinely taking 10 to 20 years for completion. With these reservations in mind, let us look at several examples of how birth and death rates change with population density--in some cases where the mechanisms behind these changes are well understood.

Resource limitation in crowded populations can stop population growth by reducing reproduction. For example, crowding can reduce seed production by plants (FIGURE 52.14a). And available food supplies often limit the reproductive output of songbirds; as bird population density increases in a particular habitat, each female lays fewer eggs, a density-dependent response (FIGURE 52.14b). In both of these examples, increasing population density intensifies intraspecific competition for declining nutrients, resulting in a lower birth rate.

Fig 52-14. Decreased fecundity at high population densities.

Factors other than intraspecific competition for food or nutrients can also cause density-dependent behavior of populations. In many vertebrates and some invertebrates, territoriality, the defense of a well-bounded physical space, may set a limit on density, so that the space that constitutes the territory becomes the resource for which individuals compete. For oceanic birds such as gannets, which nest on rocky islands where they are relatively safe from predators, the limited number of suitable nesting sites allows only a certain number of pairs to nest and reproduce. Up to a certain population size, most birds can find a suitable nest site, but few birds beyond that threshold breed successfully. Thus, the limiting resource that determines breeding population size for gannets is safe nesting space. As this space fills, birds that cannot obtain a nesting spot do not reproduce. Surplus, or nonbreeding, individuals are a good indication that territoriality is restricting population growth, as it does in many bird populations.

Population density also influences the health and thus the survival of organisms. Plants grown under crowded conditions tend to be smaller and less robust than those grown at lower densities. Small plants are less likely to survive, and those that do survive produce fewer flowers, fruit, and seeds. Gardeners who recognize this phenomenon thin their seed lings to produce the best possible yield. Animals, too, experience increased mortality at high population densities. In laboratory studies of flour beetles, for example, the percentage of eggs that hatch and survive to adulthood decreases steadily as density increases from moderate to high levels (FIGURE 52.15). The main cause of this density-dependent effect is cannibalism of eggs by adult beetles and large larvae.

Fig 52-15. Decreased survivorship at high population densities. The percentage of flour beetles (Tribolium confusum) surviving from egg stage to adult in a laboratory culture decreases as density increases from moderate to high population densities, reducing the numbers of adults in the next generation.

Predation may also be an important cause of density- dependent mortality for some prey populations if a predator encounters and captures more food as the population density of the prey increases. Many predators, for example, exhibit switching behavior: They begin to concentrate on a particularly common species of prey when it becomes energetically efficient to do so (see the discussion of optimal foraging in Chapter 51). For example, trout may concentrate for a few days on a particular species of insect that is emerging from its aquatic larval stage, then switch as another insect species becomes more abundant. As a prey population builds up, predators may feed preferentially on that species, consuming a higher percentage of individuals; this can cause density- dependent regulation of the prey population.

The accumulation of toxic wastes is another component that can contribute to density-dependent regulation of population size. In laboratory cultures of small microorganisms, for example, metabolic by-products accumulate as the population grows, poisoning the population within this limited, artificial environment. Indeed, ethanol accumulates as a waste product when yeast ferments sugar. The alcohol content of wine is usually less than 13% , the maximum ethanol concentration that most wine-producing yeast cells can tolerate.

The impact of a disease on a population can be density dependent if the transmission rate of the disease depends on a certain level of crowding in the population. For example, tuberculosis strikes a greater percentage of people living in cities than in rural areas.

For some animal species, intrinsic factors, rather than the extrinsic factors just discussed, appear to regulate population size. White-footed mice in a small field enclosure will multiply from a few to a colony of 30 to 40 individuals, but eventually, reproduction will decline until the population ceases to grow. This drop in reproduction is associated with aggressive interactions that increase with population density, and it occurs even when food and shelter are provided in abundance. Although the exact mechanisms by which aggressive behavior affects reproductive rate are not yet understood, we do know that high population densities in mice induce a stress syndrome in which hormonal changes can delay sexual maturation, cause reproductive organs to shrink, and depress the immune system. In this case, high densities cause both an increase in mortality and a decrease in birth rates. Similar effects of crowding occur in wild populations of woodchucks and other rodents.

In these various examples of population regulation by negative feedback, we have seen how increased densities cause population growth rates to decline by affecting reproduction, growth, and survivorship in the individuals that make up the populations. This helps us answer our first question about populations: why all populations eventually stop increasing. Now let's turn to our second question: why certain habitats favor greater population densities.





 Population dynamics reflect a complex interaction of biotic and abiotic influences

There are good and bad habitats for every species. Carrying capacities can vary in space; some parts of a lake provide better fishing than other parts, for example. Carrying capacities can also vary in time; grasshoppers may be serious pests for farmers in some years and nearly absent in other years. Over the long term, most populations exhibit change. Some remain fairly stable in size, but most populations for which we have long-term data show fluctuations in numbers.

Although we can determine an average population size for many species, the average is often of less interest than the year-to-year or place-to-place trend in numbers. For example, FIGURE 52.16 illustrates the fluctuation in the number of northern pintail ducks from 1955 to 1998. Pintails nest in the prairie regions of the United States and Canada, and their present populations have declined considerably below the levels of the 1950s. Wildlife managers need to find out why these changes occur. Researchers have identified the loss of prairie ponds (either by drying up in droughts or by draining for agriculture) as one key abiotic factor contributing to the pintail duck decline shown in FIGURE 52.16. However, when heavy rains kept prairie ponds full in the 1990s, the pintails did not recover. Pintails nest in the stubble left after grain is harvested. More intensive agriculture in recent years has resulted in early cultivation of stubble fields and the destruction of many pintail nests. As more and more land is taken over by agricultural fields, duck nests also become concentrated in the remaining natural vegetation, enabling predators like foxes and skunks to steal eggs from the nests more efficiently.

Fig 52-16. Decline in the breeding population of the northern pintail (Anas actua) from 1955 to 1998. Wildlife managers conduct extensive aerial surveys and ground counts each June throughout the breeding range in Canada and the United States to set hunting regulations for the autumn of each year.

Long-term population studies are also challenging the hypothesis that a combination of factors keeps populations of large mammals, such as deer and moose, relatively stable. FIGURE 52.17 shows changes in the moose population on Isle Royale, in Lake Superior, from 1959 to 2000. Moose numbers have been anything but stable, with two major increases and collapses over the last 40 years. Wolf predation is probably the main cause of the steady decline in numbers from 1973 to 1983. However, the more dramatic collapse in 1995-1996 was caused by severe winter weather and associated food shortage, leading to starvation of more than 75%  of the population. The severity of winter loss in large grazers and browsers inhabiting temperate and polar regions is proportional to the harshness of the winter. Colder temperatures increase energy requirements (and therefore the need for food), while deeper snow makes it harder to find food. The result can be widespread death from starvation.

Fig 52-17. Long-term study of the moose (Alces alces) population of Isle Royale, Michigan. Isle Royale is 544 km2 in area and lies in Lake Superior 40 km from shore. Moose colonized the island around 1900 by moving across the ice. However, the lake has not frozen over in recent years, and thus the moose population is isolated from immigration or emigration.

Some populations fluctuate erratically. The Dungeness crab is a classic example (FIGURE 52.18). Only male crabs over a certain size are commercially harvested, on the assumption that there is a vast excess of males for successful reproduction. Females mature at 2 to 3 years of age and release up to 2 million eggs each fall. One key feature of the crabs' population dy namics is cannibalism. Juvenile crabs are cannibalized by older juveniles and by adult crabs. A second key feature is that successful settlement of larval crabs occurs only in shallow waters and depends on ocean currents and water temperature. If winds and currents move larval crabs too far offshore, they cannot reach the ocean bottom to settle successfully. The com bination of cannibalism and variable and unpredictable oceanic factors explains the marked fluctuations in populations of the Dungeness crab in the Pacific Northwest. Small changes in environmental variables seem to be magnified by density-dependent cannibalism. These results support the hypothesis that the dynamics of many populations result from a complex interaction of biotic and abiotic factors.

Fig 52-18. Extreme population fluctuations. Populations of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), a commercially important species of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, are well known for their erratic fluctuations. This graph of the commercial catch of male crabs over a 40-year period at Fort Bragg, California, illustrates the general pattern. Researchers developed a mathematical model that simulates a mix of biotic factors (for example, intraspecific competition and cannibalism) and abiotic factors (for example, minor changes in water temperatures caused by alterations in ocean currents). The model accurately predicts the fluctuations in the actual catch.





 Some populations have regular boom-and-bust cycles

Some populations of insects, birds, and mammals fluctuate in density with remarkable regularity that cannot be explained by chance alone. Perhaps the most striking population cycles known are the 10-year cycles of snowshoe hares and lynx in the far northern forests of Canada and Alaska. Lynx are specialist predators of snowshoe hares, so it is not surprising that lynx numbers rise and fall with the numbers of hares (FIGURE 52.19). But why do hare numbers rise and fall in 10-year cycles? There are three main hypotheses. First, cycles may be caused by food shortage during winter. Hares eat the terminal twigs of small shrubs such as willow and birch in winter and may suffer from malnutrition due to overgrazing. Second, cycles may be due to predator-prey interactions. Many predators other than lynx, such as coyotes, foxes, and great-horned owls, eat hares, and they might overexploit their prey. Third, cycles could be affected by a combination of food resource limitation and excessive predation.

Fig 52-19. Population cycles in the snowshoe hare and lynx. Population counts are based on the number of pelts sold by trappers to the Hudson Bay Company. The cycles of lynx populations are probably caused by cyclic fluctuations of the hare, a major food source for lynx. What causes the cycling of the prey population is a challenging research problem. Most patterns of population dynamics are likely caused by multiple interacting factors that are difficult to untangle without direct experimentation.

If hare cycles are due to winter food shortage, then they should stop if extra food is added to a field population. Researchers have conducted such experiments for 20 years, over two hare cycles, in the Yukon and report two results. First, hare populations in the areas with extra food increased about threefold in density. The carrying capacity of a habitat for hares can clearly be increased by adding food. Second, the hares with extra food continued to cycle in the same way as the unfed control populations. In particular, cyclic collapses in density occurred in both experimental and control areas, and the decline in numbers could not be stopped by adding food. Thus, food supplies by themselves are not the cause of the hare cycle shown in FIGURE 52.19, so we can discard the first hypothesis.

By putting radio collars on hares, researchers can find individual hares as soon as they die, allowing field ecologists to de termine the immediate cause of death. Almost 90%  of the hares that died were killed by predators; none appeared to die of starvation. These data support either the second or third hypothesis. By excluding predators from one area with electric fences and by both excluding predators and adding food to another area, ecologists could test which of the remaining two hypotheses is the best explanation for the hare cycle. The results supported the hypothesis that the hare cycle is largely driven by excessive predation but with important impacts from the food supplies available, particularly in winter. Perhaps better-fed hares are more likely to escape from predators. Many different predators contribute to these losses; the cycle is not simply a hare-lynx cycle.

Some small herbivorous mammals, such as voles and lemmings, tend to have 3- to 4-year cycles, and some birds, such as the ruffed grouse and ptarmigan, have 9- to 11-year cycles. The causes of these cycles undoubtedly vary among species, and perhaps even among populations of the same species. Can we find common patterns in all these cycles? Several ideas have been suggested to explain cycles, but two are now prominent.

One idea is that stress resulting from a high population density may alter hormonal balance, which in turn could reduce fertility and increase aggressiveness. Stress could also be produced by unsuccessful predator attacks or from having to search longer for high-quality food or from parasites that become more common at high population density. However, there are few measurements of stress levels in natural populations, and little is known about how stress affects behavior. Crowding and stress could be a common component in many species of animals that have population cycles, but we do not yet know if it is a major cause of cycles.

Population cycles also result from a time lag in the response of predators to rising prey numbers. Predators reproduce more slowly than their prey, so they always lag behind prey population growth. Some predators, such as birds of prey, can move over large areas and respond very quickly to patches of prey abundance in the environment, eliminating the usual time lag. In other cases, such as the preying on voles and lemmings by weasels, the predators cannot move about as easily and typically show a time lag in their response to prey numbers. Such a time-lag mechanism is a probable factor in the cyclic declines in voles and lemmings, as it is in snowshoe hares.

For the lynx, great-horned owls, weasels, and other predators that depend heavily on a single prey species, the availability of prey is the major factor influencing their population changes. When prey become scarce, predators often turn on one another as well. Coyotes kill foxes and lynx, and great-horned owls kill smaller birds of prey as well as weasels, accelerating the collapse of the predator populations once prey numbers have collapsed in these cyclic systems.

Long-term experimental studies are the key to unraveling the complex causes of population cycles.





 The human population has been growing almost exponentially for three centuries but cannot do so indefinitely

The exponential growth model in FIGURE 52.8 essentially describes the population explosion of humans since 1650. Ours is a singular case; it is unlikely that any other population of large animals has ever sustained so much growth for so long. The human population increased relatively slowly until about 1650, when approximately 500 million people inhabited Earth (FIGURE 52.20). The population doubled to 1 billion within the next two centuries, doubled again to 2 billion between 1850 and 1930, and doubled still again by 1975 to more than 4 billion. The population now numbers over 6 billion people and increases by about 80 million each year. The world's population increases by 214,000 people per day, equivalent to adding a city the size of Amarillo, Texas, or Madison, Wisconsin, every day. Every week the population increases by the size of San Antonio, Milwaukee, or Indianapolis. It takes only three years for world population growth to add the population equivalent of another United States. If the present growth rate persists, there will be 7.8 billion people on Earth by the year 2025. How might this population increase stop?

Fig 52-20. Human population growth. The human population has grown almost continuously throughout history, but it has skyrocketed since the Industrial Revolution. No other population of large organisms has shown such growth for so long, and the human population must eventually either level off or decline. Whether this reduction in population growth will occur because of decreased birth rates or massive mortality is an open question, one that careful population policies can address.

The Demographic Transition

A regional human population can exist in one of two configurations to maintain population stability: 

or 

The movement from the first toward the second state is called the demographic transition. FIGURE 52.21 illustrates the demographic transition for Sweden and Mexico. In Sweden, the demographic transition took about 150 years, but in Mexico, these changes have been quicker.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 52-21. Demographic transition in Sweden and Mexico, 1750-1997. When births exceed deaths, the population grows (shaded zones). The transition from high birth and high death rates to low birth and low death rates took 150 years in Sweden but has been compressed in Mexico to half that time.

After 1950, mortality rates declined rapidly in most developing countries, but birth rates have declined in a more variable manner. Birth rate decline has been most dramatic in China. In 1970, the birth rate in China predicted an average family size of 5.9 children; by 1999, the expected family size was 1.85 children. In India, birth rates have fallen more slowly and irregularly. In much of Africa, the transition to lower birth rates is just beginning.

How do such variable birth rates affect the growth of the world's population? Clearly, population dynamics are regional. In the developed nations, populations are near equilibrium (growth rate about 0.1%  per year), with reproductive rates near the replacement level (total fertility rate = 2.1 children per female). In many developed countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, total fertility rates are in fact below replacement. These populations will eventually decline if there is no immigration and if the birth rate does not change. About 80%  of the world's people now live in the less developed countries, and most of the current population growth (1.7%  per year) is occurring in these nations.

A unique feature of human population growth is our ability to control it with voluntary contraception and family planning. Reduced family size is the key to the demographic transition. However, there is a great deal of disagreement among world leaders as to how much support should be provided for global family planning efforts. Social change and the rising educational and career aspirations of women in many cultures encourage them to delay marriage and postpone reproduction. Delayed reproduction helps to decrease population growth rates and allows us to plan for zero population growth under conditions of low birth rates and low death rates.

Age Structure

One important demographic factor in present and future growth trends is a country's age structure, the relative number of individuals of each age (FIGURE 52.22, p. 1170). The relatively uniform age distribution in Italy, for instance, contributes to that country's stable population size; individuals of reproductive age or younger are not disproportionately represented in the population. In contrast, Kenya has an age structure that is bottom-heavy, skewed toward young individuals who will grow up and sustain the explosive growth with their own reproduction. Notice in FIGURE 52.22 that the age structure for the United States is relatively even except for a bulge that corresponds to the "baby boom" that lasted for about two decades after the end of World War II. Even though couples born during those years have had an average of fewer than two children, the nation's overall birth rate still exceeds the death rate because there are still so many "boomers" and their offspring of reproductive age.

Fig 52-22. Age-structure pyramids for the human population of Kenya (growing at 2.1%  per year), the United States (growing at 0.6%  per year), and Italy (zero growth) for 1995.

Age-structure diagrams not only reveal a population's growth trends, but can also point to future social conditions. Based on the diagrams in FIGURE 52.22, we can predict, for instance, that employment for an increasing number of working-age people will continue to be a significant problem for Kenya in the foreseeable future. In Italy and the United States, a decreasing proportion of working-age people--mostly those of college age today--will soon be supporting an increasing population of retired "boomers." In the United States, it is this demographic feature that has made the future of Social Security and Medicare such a major political issue. Understanding age structures can help us plan for the future.





 Estimating Earth's carrying capacity for humans is a complex problem

The projected human population of Earth depends on assumptions about future changes in birth and death rates. For 2050, the United Nations projects a population that might range from 7.3 to 10.7 billion people. Even at the low end of this range, without some catastrophe, there will be at least 1.3 billion people added to the population in the next 25 years because of the momentum of population growth. The question that arises from these projections is what size human population the biosphere can support. Is the world already overpopulated? Will it be overpopulated in 2050?

Wide Range of Estimates for Carrying Capacity

What is the carrying capacity of Earth for humans? This question has been asked for more than 300 years by scientists interested in demography. The first known estimate for the carrying capacity of Earth was made by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1679. Since then, the estimates of carrying capacity have varied from less than 1 billion to over 1,000 billion (a trillion people). The average of the various estimates is around 10-15 billion. Why should these estimates of carrying capacity be so variable?

Carrying capacity is difficult to estimate, and the scientists who produce these estimates use different methods to get their answers. Some researchers use curves like that produced by the logistic equation (see FIGURE 52.11) to predict the future maximum of the human population. Others generalize from existing "maximum" population density and multiply this by the area of land that could be inhabited. Still other estimates are based on a single assumed population constraint such as food. Basing carrying capacity on food as the limiting factor is one promising approach. However, such estimates are limited by the assumptions required about the amount of available farmland, the average yield of crops, the prevalent diet (vegetarian or meat eating), and the number of calories to be provided to each person each day.

Ecological Footprint

A more promising approach to estimating the carrying capacity of Earth is to recognize that we have multiple constraints: We need food, fuel, wood, and other amenities such as clothing and transportation. A recent advance in using multiple constraints to estimate human carrying capacity is summarized in the concept of an ecological footprint. For each nation, we can calculate the aggregate land and water area in various ecosystem categories that is appropriated by that nation to produce all the resources it consumes and to absorb all the waste it generates. Six types of ecologically productive areas are distinguished in calculating the ecological footprint: arable land (land suitable for crops), pasture, forest, ocean, built-up land, and fossil energy land. Fossil energy land is calculated on the basis of the land required for vegetation to absorb the CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels. All measures are converted to land area (hectares per person). If we add up all the ecologically productive land on the planet, we find that there is about 2 ha per person (1 ha = 2.47 acres). If we wish to reserve land for parks and conservation, we must reduce this to 1.7 ha per person. This is the benchmark for comparing the ecological footprints of nations.

FIGURE 52.23 graphs the ecological footprints for 13 countries and for the whole world as they stood in 1997. Two inferences are evident from the graph. First, the world in general was already in ecological deficit in 1997 when this study was conducted. Second, countries vary greatly in their individual footprint size and in their available ecological capacity (the actual resource base of each country). The United States has an ecological footprint of 8.4 ha per person but has only 6.2 ha per person of available ecological capacity. In other words, the United States has a bigger ecological footprint than its own land and resources can support. By this measure, the U.S. population is already above carrying capacity. By contrast, New Zealand has a larger ecological footprint of 9.8 ha per person but an available capacity of 14.3 ha per person, so it is below its carrying capacity. The overall analysis of human impacts via ecological footprints suggests that the world is already at or slightly above its carrying capacity.

Fig 52-23. Ecological footprint in relation to available ecological capacity. The ecological footprint expresses in hectares of land per person the current demand of global resources made by each country. The available ecological capacity measures in land area per person the resource base of each particular country. Countries in black (above the red diagonal) were in an ecological deficit in 1997 when the study was conducted. Countries in blue (below the diagonal) still have resource surpluses.

We can only speculate about Earth's ultimate carrying capacity for the human population or about what factors will eventually limit our growth. Perhaps food will be the main factor. Malnutrition and famines are common in some countries, but they result mainly from unequal distribution, rather than inadequate production, of food. So far, technological improvements in agriculture have allowed food supplies to keep up with global population growth. However, we also know, based on principles of energy flow through ecosystems, that environments can support a larger number of herbivores than carnivores (see Chapter 54). If everyone ate as much meat as the wealthiest people in the world, less than half of the present world population could be fed on current food harvests. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that people in wealthier countries will abandon the consumption of meat.

Perhaps we will eventually be limited by suitable space, like the gannets on ocean islands. Certainly, as our population grows, the conflict over how space will be utilized will intensify, and agricultural land may be developed for housing. There seem to be few limits, however, on how closely humans can be crowded together.

We could also run out of resources other than nutrients and space. Many people are concerned about supplies of nonrenewable resources, such as certain metals and fossil fuels. It is also possible that our population will eventually be limited by the capacity of the environment to absorb the wastes and other insults imposed by humans. For instance, heavy use of commercial fertilizers to produce large food crops already threatens the quality of groundwater in some agricultural areas. In cases such as this, current human occupants could lower Earth's long-term carrying capacity for future generations.

Some technological optimists have suggested that Earth's carrying capacity can be continually increased--that in fact humans have no practical limits to population growth. Technology has undoubtedly increased Earth's carrying capacity for humans, but no population can continue to grow indefinitely. Exactly what the world's human carrying capacity is and under what circumstances we will approach it are topics of great concern and debate. Ideally, human populations would reach carrying capacity smoothly and then level off. Unlike other organisms, we can decide whether zero population growth will be attained through social changes involving individual choice or government intervention or through increased mortality due to resource limitation, plagues, war, and environmental degradation.

For better or worse, we have the unique responsibility to decide the fate of our species and the rest of the biosphere. We will examine these issues in greater depth when we discuss the concept of sustainability in Chapter 55.

On your next walk through a field or woodland, or even across campus or through a park, try to observe some of the interactions among the species present. You may see birds using trees as nesting sites, bees pollinating flowers, shelf fungi growing on trees, caterpillars feeding on leaves, spiders trapping insects in their webs, ferns growing in shade provided by trees--a sample of the many interactions that exist in any ecological theater. In addition to the physical and chemical factors discussed in Chapter 50, an organism's environment includes other individuals of the same species as well as populations of other species living in the same area. Such an assemblage of species living close enough together for potential interaction is called a biological community. In the photograph that opens this chapter, the lion, the zebra, the hyena, the vultures, and the grasses and other plants are all members of a grassland community in East Africa.

This chapter examines the different kinds of interactions among organisms and addresses the central issue in community ecology: What factors are most significant in structuring a community--in determining its species composition and the relative abundance of species present?

A community is any assemblage of populations in an area or habitat. Ecologists define the boundaries of a particular community to fit their research questions. We might study the community of decomposers and other organisms in a rotting log, the benthic community in Lake Superior, or the community of trees and shrubs in Shenandoah National Park. A community has a set of properties defined by its species composition, with a structure determined by the interactions between the species. Communities differ dramatically in their species richness, the number of species that they contain. But some species are common and some are rare, and so communities also differ in their relative abundance of different species. What causes each community to have a certain assemblage of species? Two very different answers to this question have polarized community ecologists for over 50 years.





INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

 

 Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism



 

 Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics



 

 Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure



 

 The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators



There are different interspecific interactions--relationships between the species of a community. We will start with the simplest situation: an interaction between just two species.





DISTURBANCE AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

 

 Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances



 

 Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance



 

 Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance



Decades ago, most ecologists favored the traditional view that biological communities are in a state of equilibrium, a more or less stable balance, unless seriously disturbed by human activities. This "balance of nature" view focused on interspecific competition as a key factor determining community composition and maintaining stability in communities. Stability in this context is the tendency of a community to reach and maintain an equilibrium, or relatively constant composition of species, in the face of disturbances. But in many communities, at least on a local scale, change seems to be more common than stability. This recent emphasis on change has led to a nonequilibrium model of communities, where communities are seen as constantly changing after being buffeted by disturbances. The key question here is the role of disturbances in affecting community structure and composition.





BIOGEOGRAPHIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE BIODIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES

 

 Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance



 

 Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient



 

 Species richness is related to a community's geographic size



 

 Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland



Ecological communities vary extensively in the number of species they contain. Two key factors correlated with a community's biodiversity, or species diversity, are its size and geographic location. In the 1850s, both Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin pointed out that plant and animal life was generally more abundant and varied in the tropics than in other parts of the globe. Darwin and Wallace also noted that small or remote islands have fewer species than large islands or those nearer continents. Such observations imply that biogeographic patterns in biodiversity conform to a set of basic principles rather than being accidents of evolutionary history. How can we explain these large-scale patterns in the diversity of life? We must first learn how to measure the biodiversity of a community.





 Contrasting views of communities are rooted in the individualistic and interactive hypotheses

How can we account for the species found together as members of a community? Two different views on this question emerged among ecologists in the 1920s and 1930s, based primarily on observations of plant distributions. We will briefly describe these historical arguments because they are the forerunners of the closely related rivet and redundancy models, two community models still debated today.

An individualistic hypothesis of community structure was first enunciated by H. A. Gleason, of the University of Chicago, in the early 1900s. It depicted the plant community as a chance assemblage of species found in the same area simply because they happen to have similar abiotic requirements--for example, for temperature, rainfall, and soil type. An alternative view, the interactive hypothesis, was advocated by F. E. Clements, also in the early 1900s. Clements saw the community as an assemblage of closely linked species, locked into association by mandatory biotic interactions that cause the community to function as an integrated unit--as a superorganism. Evidence for the interactive view was based on the observation that certain species of plants are consistently found together as a group. For example, deciduous forests in the northeastern United States usually include certain species of oak, maple, birch, and beech, along with a specific assemblage of shrubs and vines. These two very different ways of thinking about community structure--individualistic versus interactive--suggest different priorities in studying biological communities. The individualistic hypothesis emphasizes studying single species, while the interactive hypothesis emphasizes entire assemblages of species as the essential units for understanding the interrelationships and distributions of organisms.

These two hypotheses of plant community organization make contrasting predictions about how plant species should be distributed along an environmental gradient, such as a gradual change in moisture or temperature over some distance. The individualistic hypothesis predicts that communities should generally lack discrete geographic boundaries because each species has an independent distribution along the environmental gradient. In other words, each species will be distributed according to its tolerance ranges for abiotic factors that vary along a gradient, and communities should change continuously along the gradient, with the addition or loss of particular species (FIGURE 53.1a). In contrast, the interactive hypothesis predicts that species should be clustered into discrete communities with noticeable boundaries, because the presence or absence of a particular species is largely governed by the presence or absence of other species with which it interacts in its group (FIGURE 53.1b).

Fig 53-1. Testing the individualistic and interactive hypotheses of communities. Ecologist Robert Whittaker tested these two hypotheses by graphing the abundance of different plant species (y axis) along environmental gradients of abiotic factors such as temperature or moisture (x axis). Each colored curve represents the abundance of one species.

In most actual cases, especially where there are broad regions characterized by gradients of environmental variation, the composition of plant communities does seem to change continuously, with each species more or less independently distributed (FIGURE 53.1c). Such distributions generally support the view of plant communities as relatively loose associations without discrete boundaries. However, where some key factor in the physical environment changes abruptly, adjacent communities are delineated by correspondingly sharp boundaries. The most striking examples of sharp boundaries result from changes in soil type. In general, sharp boundaries between plant communities are rare in nature. However, humans have altered the landscape through agriculture and forestry to produce many artificial sharp boundaries, and in Chapter 55, we will explore the consequences of this habitat alteration.





 The debate continues with the rivet and redundancy models

The individualistic hypothesis is generally accepted by plant ecologists today, but further debate arises in the application of these ideas to the animals in a community. In 1981, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, of Stanford University, suggested that species in a community are like the rivets in the wings of airplanes: Not all the rivets are required to hold the wing together, but if someone started taking out the rivets one by one, we would become concerned about flying in that airplane. The rivet model of communities is a reincarnation of the interactive model of Clements that was suggested for plant communities. The rivet model suggests that most of the species in a community are associated tightly with other species in a web of life. Thus, reducing or increasing the abundance of one species in a community affects many other species.

In 1992, Brian Walker suggested an opposing view of communities, the redundancy model. According to this model, most of the species in a community are not tightly associated with one another, and the web of life is very loose. An increase or decrease in one species in a community has little effect on other species, which operate independently, just as suggested by Gleason 80 years before in his individualistic model of the plant community. Species within a community are redundant. For example, if one predator disappears, another predatory species in the community will usually take its place as a consumer of specific prey. If one pollinator ceases to visit a particular species of flowering plant because the pollinator has disappeared from the area, another pollinator species will do the job.

No matter which (if either) of these two models is correct, it is important to study species relationships in communities. Species in communities do interact, even if some of these interactions are not imperative for the species. It is also important to remember that these two models represent extremes, although most communities actually lie somewhere in the middle. To answer some key questions, we need to determine how species interact in communities and how tight these associations are. For example, what happens to a community when one species is lost or is replaced with a species introduced by humans? Such questions are important because they underlie many of our environmental problems today.





 Populations may be linked by competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism

The possible interspecific interactions are introduced in TABLE 53.1. In this simplified view, we use a pair of signs, such as +/-, to symbolize how an interspecific interaction affects the population densities of the two species. For example, mutual symbiosis (mutualism) is a +/+ interaction, meaning that the density of each species is increased in the presence of the other. Predation is an example of a +/- interaction, with a positive effect on the population density of one species (the predator) and a negative effect on the density of the other population (the prey).

Interspecific competition for resources can occur when resources are in short supply. The weeds growing in a garden are competing with garden plants for soil nutrients and water. Grasshoppers and bison compete in the Great Plains for the grass they eat. Lynx and foxes compete for prey such as snowshoe hares in the northern forests of Alaska and Canada. There is a potential for competition between any two species that need the same limited resource. Some resources, such as oxygen, are not usually in short supply, and although many species use this resource, they do not compete for it. If two populations do compete for a resource, the result may be a reduction in the density of one or both species or the local elimination of one of the two competitors.

The Competitive Exclusion Principle. In 1934, Russian ecologist G. F. Gause studied the effects of interspecific competition in laboratory experiments with two closely related species of protists, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum. Gause cultured the protists under stable conditions with a constant amount of food added every day. When he grew the two species in separate cultures, each population grew rapidly and then leveled off at what was apparently the carrying capacity of the culture. But when Gause cultured the two species together, P. aurelia apparently had a competitive edge in obtaining food, and P. caudatum was driven to extinction in the culture. Gause concluded that two species so similar that they compete for the same limiting resources cannot coexist in the same place. One will use the resources more efficiently and thus reproduce more rapidly. Even a slight reproductive advantage will eventually lead to local elimination of the inferior competitor. Ecologists call Gause's concept the competitive exclusion principle.

The Ecological Niche. The sum total of a species' use of the biotic and abiotic resources in its environment is called the species' ecological niche. One way to grasp the concept is through an analogy made by ecologist Eugene Odum: If an organism's habitat is its address, the niche is that habitat plus the organism's occupation. Put another way, an organism's niche is its ecological role--how it "fits into" an ecosystem. The niche of a population of tropical tree lizards, for example, consists of, among many other components, the temperature range it tolerates, the size of branches on which it perches, the time of day in which it is active, and the size and type of insects it eats.

We can now restate the competitive exclusion principle to say that two species cannot coexist in a community if their niches are identical. However, ecologically similar species can coexist in a community if there are one or more significant differences in their niches. Numerous tests of competitive exclusion hypotheses include classic field experiments with two species of barnacles that attach to intertidal rocks on the North Atlantic coast (FIGURE 53.2).

Fig 53-2. Testing a competitive exclusion hypothesis in the field. Balanus balanoides and Chthamalus stellatus are two species of barnacles that grow on rocks exposed during low tide along the Scottish coast. The barnacles have a stratified distribution, with Balanus most concentrated on the lower portions of the rocks and Chthamalus on the higher portions. The swimming larvae of the barnacles may settle randomly on the rocks and begin to develop into sessile adults, but Balanus fails to survive high on the rocks because it is unable to resist desiccation when these areas are exposed to air for several hours during low tides. Its fundamental niche (potential niche) and its realized niche (actual niche) are similar. Even though Chthamalus is concentrated primarily on the upper strata of rocks, when ecologist Joseph Connell removed Balanus from the lower strata, the Chthamalus population spread into that area. Thus, Chthamalus could survive lower on the rocks than where it is generally found, were it not for competition from Balanus. Its realized niche is only a fraction of its fundamental niche.

Resource Partitioning. There are two possible outcomes of competition between species having identical niches: Either the less competitive species will be driven to local extinction, or one of the species may evolve enough through natural selection to use a different set of resources. This differentiation of niches that enables similar species to coexist in a community is called resource partitioning (FIGURE 53.3, p. 1178). We can think of resource partitioning within a community as "the ghost of competition past"--circumstantial evidence of earlier interspecific competition resolved by the evolution of niche differentiation.

Character Displacement. As a complement to studies of resource partitioning, a related line of circumstantial evidence for the importance of competition comes from comparisons of closely related species whose populations are sometimes sympatric and sometimes allopatric. Although allopatric populations of such species are similar in structure and use similar resources, sympatric populations often show differences in body structures and in the resources they use. The tendency for characteristics to be more divergent in sympatric populations of two species than in allopatric populations of the same two species is called character displacement. The Gal&aacute;pagos finches described in Chapter 25 provide a good example of character displacement in beak sizes and, presumably, in the seeds that they can eat most efficiently. Allopatric populations of Geospiza fuliginosa and G. fortis have beaks of similar size, but on an island where both species occur, a significant difference in beak depth has evolved (FIGURE 53.4, p. 1178). This difference presumably enables the two species to avoid competition by feeding on seeds of different sizes and probably represents an evolutionary outcome of past competition.

Fig 53-4. Character displacement: circumstantial evidence for competition in nature. Although allopatric populations of potential competitors are often similar in morphology and use equivalent resources, sympatric populations may diverge in both characteristics. In this example, two species of Gal&eacute;pagos finches have similar beak morphologies and presumably eat similarly sized seeds where their populations are allopatric on Daphne and Los Hermanos islands. However, where the two species are sympatric on Santa Mar&iacute;a and San Crist&oacute;bal, Geospiza fuliginosa has a shallower, smaller beak and G. fortis a deeper, larger one. Such evolutionary changes in body structure are thought to reflect resource partitioning. In this case, the two species have adapted to eating different sizes of seeds.

Predation

The term predation illicits such images as a lion killing and eating an antelope or other prey. But ecologists extend the definition of predation to include herbivory, in which an herbivore such as a bison eats part of a plant, and parasitism, in which a parasite lives on or in its host organism and depends on the host species for nutrition.

It won't surprise you that predation is a potent factor in adaptive evolution. Eating and avoiding being eaten are prerequisite to reproductive success. Natural selection refines the adaptations of both predators and prey.

Predator Adaptations. Many important feeding adaptations of predators are both obvious and familiar. Most predators have acute senses that enable them to locate and identify potential prey. In addition, many predators have adaptations such as claws, teeth, fangs, stingers, or poison that help catch and subdue the organisms on which they feed. Rattlesnakes and other pit vipers, for example, locate their prey with special heat-sensing organs located between each eye and nostril, and they kill small birds and mammals by injecting them with toxins through their fangs. Similarly, many herbivorous insects locate appropriate food plants by the using chemical sensors on their feet, and their mouthparts are adapted for shredding tough vegetation. Predators that pursue their prey are generally fast and agile, whereas those that lie in ambush are often camouflaged in their environments.

Plant Defenses Against Herbivores. Plants cannot run away from herbivores. Chemical toxins, often in combination with antipredator spines and thorns, are a plant's main arsenal against being eaten to extinction. Among such chemical weapons are the poison strychnine, produced by the tropical vine Strychnos toxifera; morphine, from the opium poppy; nicotine, from the tobacco plant; mescaline, from peyote cactus; and tannins, from a variety of plant species. Other defensive compounds that are not toxic to humans but may be distasteful to other herbivores are responsible for the familiar flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and peppermint. Some plants even produce chemicals that imitate insect hormones and cause abnormal development in some insects that eat them.

Animal Defenses Against Predators. Animals can avoid being eaten by using passive defenses, such as hiding, or active defenses, such as escaping or defending themselves against predators. Fleeing is a common antipredator response, though it can be very costly in terms of energy. Many animals flee into a shelter and avoid being caught without expending the energy required for a prolonged flight. Active self-defense is less common, though some large grazing mammals will vigorously defend their young from predators such as lions. Other behavioral defenses include alarm calls, which often bring in many individuals of the prey species that mob the predator. For example, crows will sometimes gang up and peck on barn owls, which prey on crow eggs.

Many other defenses rely on adaptive coloration, which has evolved repeatedly among animals. Camouflage, or cryptic coloration, is a passive defense that makes potential prey difficult to spot against its background (FIGURE 53.5).

Some animals have mechanical or chemical defenses against would-be predators (see the interview with Thomas Eisner on p. 24). Most predators are strongly discouraged by the familiar defenses of skunks and porcupines. Some animals, such as poisonous toads and frogs, can synthesize toxins. Others acquire chemical defense passively by accumulating toxins from the plants they eat. For example, monarch butterflies store poisons from the milkweed plants they eat as larvae, making the butterflies distasteful to some potential predators.

Animals with effective chemical defenses are often brightly colored, a warning to predators known as aposematic coloration (FIGURE 53.6). This warning coloration seems to be adaptive; there is evidence that predators are more cautious in dealing with bright color patterns in potential prey, perhaps because so many aposematic animals tend to be dangerous prey. In an example of convergent evolution, unpalatable animals in several different taxa have similar patterns of coloration--black with yellow or red stripes characterize unpalatable animals as diverse as yellow-jacket wasps and coral snakes.

Fig 53-6. Aposematic (warning) coloration of a poison-arrow frog. The skin of this tree frog, an inhabitant of rain forests in Costa Rica, produces noxious chemicals. Predators apparently learn to associate the vivid markings of the frog with danger as soon as they touch the frog's skin. In some parts of South America, human hunters in the rain forest tip their arrows with poisons from similar frogs to bring down large mammals.

A species of prey may gain significant protection through mimicry, a "copycat" adaptation in which one species mimics the appearance of another. In Batesian mimicry, a palatable or harmless species mimics an unpalatable or harmful model. In one intriguing example, the larva of the hawkmoth puffs up its head and thorax when disturbed, looking like the head of a small poisonous snake, complete with eyes (FIGURE 53.7). The mimicry even involves behavior; the larva weaves its head back and forth and hisses like a snake. In M&uuml;llerian mimicry, two or more unpalatable species resemble each other. Presumably, each species gains an additional advantage because the pooling of numbers causes predators to learn more quickly to avoid any prey with a particular appearance (FIGURE 53.8).

Fig 53-8. M&uuml;llerian mimicry. Both (a) the cuckoo bee and (b) the yellow jacket wasp have stingers that release toxins. The cross-mimicry in appearance presumably benefits both species because predators learn more quickly to avoid any prey with these distinctive markings.

Predators also use mimicry in a variety of ways. For example, some snapping turtles have tongues that resemble a wriggling worm, thus luring small fish; any fish that tries to eat the "bait" is itself quickly consumed as the turtle's strong jaws snap closed.

Parasites and Pathogens as Predators. Parasitism is a symbiotic interaction in which one organism, the parasite, derives its nourishment from another organism, its host, which is harmed in the process. (Note that this text adopts the most general definition of symbiosis as including parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism, which are all discussed in this chapter. However, some biologists prefer to use the term symbiosis more specifically as a synonym for mutualism.)

Parasites that live within their host, such as tapeworms and malarial parasites, are called endoparasites; parasites that feed on the external surface of a host, such as mosquitoes and aphids, are called ectoparasites. In a special type of parasitism called parasitoidism, insects--usually small wasps--lay eggs on living hosts. The larvae then feed on the body of the host, eventually killing it.

In terms of their effects, pathogens, or disease-causing organisms, are similar to parasites. Pathogens are typically bacteria, viruses, or protists, but fungi and prions (protein bodies; see Chapter 18) may also be pathogenic. In contrast to pathogens, which are generally microscopic, many parasites are relatively large, multicellular organisms, such as tapeworms. Also, most parasites inflict nonlethal damage on their hosts--by pilfering nutrients, for example--while many pathogens can inflict lethal harm.

Mutualism

Mutual symbiosis, or mutualism, is an interspecific interaction that benefits both species. Mutualistic relationships sometimes require the coevolution of adaptations in both participating species. Changes in either species are likely to affect the survival and reproduction of the other. We have described many examples of mutualism in previous chapters: nitrogen fixation by bacteria in the root nodules of legumes; the digestion of cellulose by microorganisms in the digestive systems of termites and ruminant mammals; photosynthesis by unicellular algae in the tissues of corals: and the exchange of nutrients in mycorrhizae, the association of fungi and the roots of plants. FIGURE 53.9 illustrates another example, a mutualism between ants and acacia trees in Central and South America.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 53-9. Mutualism between acacia trees and ants. Certain species of Central and South American acacia trees have hollow thorns that house stinging ants of the genus Pseudomyrmex. The ants feed on sugar produced by nectaries on the tree and on protein-rich swellings called Beltian bodies (orange in the photograph) that grow at the tips of leaflets. The acacia benefits from housing and feeding a population of pugnacious ants, which attack anything that touches the tree. The ants sting other insects, remove fungal spores and other debris, and clip surrounding vegetation that happens to grow close to the foliage of the acacia.

Many mutualistic relationships may have evolved from predator-prey or host-parasite interactions. Most angiosperm plants, for example, have adaptations that attract animals that function in pollination or seed dispersal. Any plants that could derive some benefit by sacrificing such organic materials as nectar rather than pollen or seeds would increase their reproductive success.

Commensalism

Commensalism is an interaction between species that benefits only one of the species involved in the interaction. "Hitchhiking" species, such as algae that grow on the shells of aquatic turtles or barnacles that attach to whales, are sometimes considered commensal. However, the hitchhikers may actually decrease the reproductive success of their hosts slightly by reducing the efficiency of movement in the hosts' search for food or escape from predators.

Commensal associations sometimes involve one species obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by another. For instance, cowbirds and cattle egrets (also birds) feed on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing bison, cattle, horses, and other herbivores. Because the birds increase their feeding rates when following the herbivores, they clearly benefit from the association. Much of the time, the herbivores may be unaffected by the relationship. However, there are times when they, too, derive some benefit; the birds tend to be opportunistic feeders that occasionally remove and eat ticks and other ectoparasites from the herbivores.

Coevolution and Interspecific Interactions

In describing the adaptations of certain organisms to the presence of other organisms in a community, the term coevolution comes up often--perhaps too often. There is actually little evidence for coevolution in most cases of interspecific interactions.

Coevolution refers to reciprocal evolutionary adaptations of two interacting species. A change in one species acts as a selective force on another species, in which counteradaptation in turn acts as a selective force on the first species. This linkage of adaptations requires reciprocal genetic change in the interacting populations of the two species. An example of such dual adaptation that probably qualifies as coevolution is the gene-for-gene recognition between a plant species and a species of avirulent pathogen (see FIGURE 39.31). In contrast, the warning coloration of various tree frogs and the aversion reactions of various predators do not qualify as coevolution because these are adaptations to a category of other organisms in the community rather than coupled adaptation between just two species.

Despite the current view that coevolution is difficult to demonstrate for most interspecific interactions in communities, biologists agree more generalized adaptation of organisms to other organisms in their environment--to biotic factors--is a fundamental feature of life. Which of the biological interactions we have surveyed is most important in structuring communities? At the present time, most ecologists think that predation and competition are the key processes driving community dynamics. But this conclusion is based mainly on research in temperate communities. Ecologists have far fewer data for interspecific interactions in tropical communities.





 Trophic structure is a key factor in community dynamics

The dynamics and structure of a community depend to a large extent on the feeding relationships between organisms--the trophic structure of the community. The transfer of food energy from its source in plants and other photosynthetic organisms (primary producers) through herbivores (primary consumers) to carnivores (secondary and tertiary consumers) and eventually to decomposers is referred to as a food chain. In the 1920s, Oxford biologist Charles Elton first pointed out that the length of a food chain is usually limited to four or five links, or trophic levels (FIGURE 53.10). Elton also recognized that food chains are not isolated units but are hooked together into food webs.

Fig 53-10. Examples of terrestrial and marine food chains. The arrows trace energy and nutrients that pass through the trophic levels of a community when organisms feed on one another. Decomposers (detritivores) are not shown here.

Food Webs

Who eats whom in a community? An ecologist can summarize the trophic relationships of a community by diagramming a food web with arrows linking species according to their trophic relationship. For example, FIGURE 53.11 is a simplified food web for an Antarctic pelagic community found in the seasonally productive Southern Ocean. The dominant herbivores in the Antarctic are euphausids (krill, which are crustaceans) and herbivorous plankton such as copepods. These zooplankton species are in turn eaten by various carnivores, including penguins, seals, fish, and baleen whales. Squid, which are carnivores that feed on fish as well as zooplankton, are another important link in these food chains, as they are in turn eaten by seals and toothed whales. During the whaling years, humans became the top predator of this food chain. Having reduced the whales to low numbers, humans are now harvesting at lower trophic levels, including the fishing for krill.

Fig 53-11. An antarctic marine food web. Arrows follow the transfer of food from the producers (phytoplankton) through the trophic levels. As in FIGURE 53.10, this diagram omits decomposers, which "feed" at all trophic levels. Blue arrows indicate the major trophic interactions.

What transforms food chains into food webs? First, a given species may weave into the web at more than one trophic level. For example, male horseflies feed as primary consumers on nectar and plant juices, whereas the females are bloodsucking ectoparasites that feed as secondary or even tertiary consumers. Second, most consumers are nonexclusive. For example, foxes are omnivores with diets that include berries and other plant materials, herbivores such as mice, and other predators, such as weasels. Humans are among the most versatile of omnivores.

Food webs can be very complicated, but we can simplify them in two ways. First, we can group species into fairly broad taxonomic groups if their trophic relationships in a community are similar. For example, in FIGURE 53.11, over 100 phytoplankton species are combined in one "functional group," that of primary consumers in the food web. A second way to simplify a food web is to isolate a part of the web that interacts very little with the rest of the community. FIGURE 53.12 illustrates a partial food web for sea nettles (jellies) and juvenile striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. This partial food web can be "pulled out" from a more complex web because these species interact very little with the rest of the community in terms of feeding relationships. Note that sea nettles are secondary consumers of zooplankton and tertiary consumers of fish larvae, which themselves are secondary consumers of zooplankton.

Animals at successive trophic levels in a food chain tend to be larger with each link (except for parasites). There are upper and lower limits to the size of food a carnivorous animal can eat. The size of an animal and its feeding mechanism puts some upper limit on the size of food it can take into its mouth. And except in a few cases, large carnivores cannot live on very small food items because they cannot procure enough food in a given time to meet their metabolic needs. Among the exceptions are baleen whales, huge suspension feeders with adaptations that enable them to consume enormous quantities of krill and other small organisms (see FIGURE 41.6).

What Limits the Length of a Food Chain?

Each food chain we can identify in a food web is only a few links long. For example, in the Antarctic web of FIGURE 53.11, there are only four or five links from the producers to any top-level predators. In fact, for all the food webs that ecologists have studied so far, most chains have five or fewer links, although a few are as long as nine links.

Why are food chains relatively short? There are two main hypotheses. The energetic hypothesis is the most widely accepted explanation for food chain length. It suggests that the length of a food chain is limited by the inefficiency of energy transfer along the chain. As we will see in the next chapter, only about 10%  of the energy stored in the organic matter of any trophic level is converted to organic matter at the next trophic level. If we start with 100 kg of plant material, we can support about 10 kg of herbivore production and 1 kg of carnivore production. If this energetic hypothesis is correct, food chains should be longer in habitats of higher photosynthetic productivity, a prediction that can be tested.

A second hypothesis to explain the limited length of food chains is the dynamic stability hypothesis. According to this idea, long food chains are less stable than short chains. Fluctuations at lower trophic levels are magnified at higher levels, potentially causing the extinction of top predators. In a variable environment, top predators must be able to recover from environmental shocks (such as extreme winters) that can reduce the food supply, from producers all the way up the food chain. The longer the food chain, the slower the recovery rate from environmental setbacks for top predators. This hypothesis predicts shorter food chains in unpredictable environments, and this prediction can again be tested by the collection of food chain data.

Most of the data available support the energetic hypothesis as the likely explanation for the shortness of food chains. For example, ecologists have used tree-hole communities in tropical forests as experimental models to test the energetic hypothesis. Many trees have small branch scars that rot to form small holes in the tree trunk. Tree holes hold water and provide habitat for tiny communities sustained by the leaf litter trapped by the water. FIGURE 53.13 shows the results of a set of experiments in which productivity (leaf litter falling into the tree holes) was manipulated. As predicted by the energetic hypothesis, holes with the most leaf litter, and hence the greatest total food supply at the producer level, supported the longest food chains.

Fig 53-13. Test of the energetic hypothesis for the restriction on food chain length. Researchers manipulated the productivity of tree-hole communities in Queensland, Australia, with leaf litter input at three levels: high litter input = natural (control) rate of litter fall; medium = 1/10 natural rate; and low = 1/100 natural rate. Reducing energy input reduced food chain length, a result consistent with the energetic hypothesis. The tree-hole community consists of microbes that break down leaf litter, mosquito larvae that feed on these microbes, predatory midges (chironomids), and other insects that feed directly on leaf litter.





 Dominant species and keystone species exert strong controls on community structure

Certain species may have an especially large impact on entire communities, either because of their abundance (dominant species) or because of their pivotal roles in community dynamics (keystone species).

Dominant Species

Dominant species are those species in a community that have the highest abundance or highest biomass (the sum weight of all individuals in a population). They exert a powerful control over the occurrence and distribution of other species. For example, the sugar maple is the dominant plant species in many forest communities in eastern North America, and the abundance of maples has a major impact on abiotic factors such as shading and soil, which affect the entire forest community.

Why do some species become dominant in a community? According to one hypothesis, species that are most competitive in exploiting limited resources such as water or nutrients are the most likely species to become dominant. But a competitive edge in resource use may not be the only explanation for why a species becomes dominant. In some communities, a dominant species may owe its abundance to greater success than other potential dominants at avoiding predators.

What happens if we remove a dominant species from a community? Humans have carried out this type of experiment many times by accident. The American chestnut was a dominant tree in the eastern deciduous forests of North America before 1910, making up more than 40%  of the canopy (top-story) trees. This species is now absent as a canopy tree as a result of a disease called chestnut blight. This fungal disease attacks only chestnut trees. Humans accidentally introduced the fungus to New York City in 1910 on nursery stock imported from Asia. The pathogen has only a weak impact on Chinese chestnuts, but is lethal to American chestnuts. Between 1910 and 1950, chestnut blight killed all the chestnut trees in eastern North America. Thus, what had been the dominant tree of many of these eastern forests was eliminated. How did this affect the overall forest communities? The impact of removing the dominant species was actually small, at least as far as researchers can tell. The forests have filled in with various species of oaks, hickories, beech, and red maple, and these trees have increased in abundance and replaced the chestnut. Some species of insects, however, were affected. Fifty-six species of moths and butterflies fed on the American chestnut. Of these, 7 species became extinct, but the other 49 species did not rely exclusively on the chestnut for food, and they still survive. No mammals or birds seem to have been seriously affected by this loss of a dominant species. In communities in which dominance is achieved by competitive ability, the loss of a dominant may not have a great effect, because one or more other species with slightly less competitive ability may take over the role of the dominant. This is an example of an outcome predicted by the redundancy model of community structure.

Keystone Species

In contrast to dominant species, most keystone species are not especially abundant in a community. They exert strong control on community structure not so much by numerical might as by their ecological roles, or niches. One of the best ways to recognize keystone species is by removal experiments, which is exactly how ecologist Robert Paine first developed the concept of keystone species. The sea star Pisaster ochraceous is a keystone predator of mussels in rocky intertidal communities of western North America (FIGURE 53.14a). When Paine removed Pisaster manually from rocky intertidal areas, the mussel Mytilus californianus was able to monopolize space and exclude other invertebrates and algae from attachment sites (FIGURE 53.14b). M. californianus is a dominant species, a superior competitor for open space in the rocky intertidal zone. Predation by Pisaster offsets this competitive edge and allows other species to use the space vacated by Mytilus. Pisaster is not able to eliminate mussels entirely because Mytilus can grow too large to be eaten by the sea star. Size-limited predation provides some refuge for this prey species, and these large mussels are able to produce large numbers of fertilized eggs that help recolonize vacant space on the rocks. Paine observed that when sea stars are present, 15 to 20 species of invertebrates and algae occur in the intertidal zone. But after experimental removal of Pisaster, species diversity quickly declines to less than 5 species because the mussel, unchecked by the keystone predator, is able to monopolize space. Thus, the important role of Pisaster is not reflected in its abundance.

Sea otters, a keystone predator in the North Pacific, offer another example. Once relatively abundant, they were reduced to near extinction by the fur trade during the 19th century. An international treaty provided protection in the 20th century, enabling sea otter populations to recover to very high densities. Sea otters feed on sea urchins, and sea urchins feed mainly on kelp. In areas where sea otters are abundant, sea urchins are rare and kelp forests are well developed. Where sea otters are rare, sea urchins are common and kelp is almost absent. During the last 20 years, sea otters have declined precipitously in large areas off the coast of western Alaska (FIGURE 53.15), sometimes at rates of 25%  per year. The loss of this keystone species has allowed sea urchin populations to increase, resulting in the destruction of kelp forests. Ecologists suspect that killer whales are the cause of the sea otter decline. Killer whales have probably been eating sea otters for the past two decades because the previous prey of the whales, mainly seals and sea lions, have declined in density. And the decline of these prey species reflects a decline in the populations of fish species that the seals and sea lions eat. And all of these changes in these Alaskan marine communities have probably rippled from human overfishing in the North Pacific. From case studies such as these, ecologists are just beginning to outline the key interactions that help structure aquatic and terrestrial communities.

The food chains alongside the graphs illustrate a hypothesis for a change in kelp forest communities due to killer whales preying on sea otters.





 The structure of a community may be controlled bottom-up by nutrients or top-down by predators

Simplified models based on relationships between adjacent trophic levels are useful for discussing how communities of plants, animals, and other organisms might be organized. For example, consider the three possible relationships between plants (V for vegetation) and herbivores (H): The arrows indicate that a change in the biomass (total weight) of one trophic level causes a change in the other trophic level. For example, VH means that an increase in vegetation will impact (increase) the numbers or biomass of herbivores, but not vice versa. In this situation, herbivores are limited by vegetation, but vegetation is not limited by herbivory. In contrast, VH means that an increase in herbivore biomass will have an impact on vegetation (decreasing it), but not vice versa. A double arrow indicates that feedback flows in both directions, with each trophic level sensitive to changes in the biomass of the other.

Based on these possible interactions, we can distinguish two models of community organization: the bottom-up model and the top-down model. The bottom-up model postulates VH linkages. In this case, mineral nutrients (N) control community organization because the nutrients control plant (V) numbers, which control herbivore (H) numbers, which in turn control predator (P) numbers. The simplified bottom-up model is thus NVHP. If you want to change the community structure of a bottom-up community, you need to alter biomass at the lower trophic levels. For example, if you add mineral nutrients to stimulate growth of vegetation, then all the other trophic levels should also increase in biomass. But if you add predators or remove predators from a bottom-up community, the effect will not extend down to the lower trophic levels.

In contrast, the top-down model postulates that it is mainly predation that controls community organization because predators control herbivores, which in turn control plants, which in turn control nutrient levels. The simplified top-down model is thus NVHP. This top-down control of community structure is also called the trophic cascade model. It predicts a cascade of +/- effects down the trophic levels. Increasing predators will depress herbivore numbers, the depressed herbivore numbers will have a reduced impact on plant abundance, and the abundant plants will depress levels of mineral nutrients. For example, in a lake community with four trophic levels, the trophic cascade model predicts that removing the top carnivores will increase the abundance of primary carnivores, decrease herbivores, increase phytoplankton, and eventually decrease concentrations of mineral nutrients. If there were only three trophic levels in a lake, removing the primary carnivores would increase the herbivores and decrease the phytoplankton, causing nutrient levels to rise. The effects of any manipulation will thus move down the trophic structure as a series of +/- effects.

Many other models intermediate between the bottom-up and top-down extremes are possible. For example, all the interactions between trophic levels could be reciprocal (). The value of these simplified models is that they provide a starting point for the analysis of communities. Let's look at one example where ecologists have applied these models to counter pollution problems in lakes.

Pollution has degraded the freshwater lakes in many countries. Because many freshwater lake communities seem to be structured according to the top-down, or trophic cascade, model, ecologists have a potential method for improving water quality. In lakes with four trophic levels, for example, adding top predators should improve water quality by reducing algal populations. In lakes with three trophic levels, removing fish should improve water quality. We can summarize this strategy for lake restoration, called biomanipulation, with this diagram.






One of the largest biomanipulations of food webs so far was the Lake Vesij&auml;rvi experiment in southern Finland. Vesij&auml;rvi is a large (110 km2), shallow lake that was heavily polluted with city sewage and industrial wastewater until 1976. Pollution controls then stopped these inputs, and the lake began to recover in water quality. But by 1986, massive blooms of cyanobacteria began to occur. These algal blooms coincided with a very dense population of roach, a plankton-eating fish that had accumulated during the years of mineral nutrient (pollution) input. Roach eat zooplankton, and by reducing zooplankton, they also reduced herbivory on cyanobacteria and other algae, which then increased in abundance. To reverse these changes, ecologists removed 1,018 tons of fish from Lake Vesijrvi between 1989 and 1993, reducing roach to about 20%  of their former abundance. At the same time, the ecologists began to stock the lake with pike perch, a predatory fish that eats roach. This added a fourth trophic level to the lake. Biomanipulation was a success in Lake Vesijrvi. The water became clear, and cyanobacterial blooms ended in 1989. The lake continues to remain clear even though the roach removal was stopped in 1993.

Communities will vary in the relative degree of top-down and bottom-up control, and we should not assume that one model will fit all communities. If humans are to manage agricultural landscapes, national parks, reservoirs, and marine fisheries, we need to understand the dynamics of the community we are attempting to manage. This is just one example of how basic ecological research can help us evaluate environmental issues.





 Most communities are in a state of nonequilibrium owing to disturbances

Disturbances are events, such as storms, fire, floods, droughts, overgrazing, or human activities, that damage communities, remove organisms from them, and alter resource availability. The types of disturbances and their frequency and severity vary from community to community. Storms disturb almost all communities, even those in deep oceans. Fire is a significant cause of disturbance in most terrestrial communities; grasslands and chaparral biomes are dependent on regular burning (FIGURE 53.16). Freezing is a frequent occurrence in many rivers, lakes, and ponds, and many streams and ponds are disturbed by spring flooding and seasonal drying. Disturbances often create opportunities for species that have not previously occupied habitats to become established. By gathering data from specific communities over many years, ecologists are beginning to appreciate and understand the impact of disturbances. Let's look at one example.

Fig 53-16. Routine disturbance in a grassland community. Historically, prairie grasslands were often swept by fire. These photographs were taken (a) before, (b) during, and (c) after a controlled burn conducted by ecologists studying the long-term effects of fire on a tallgrass prairie in Kansas. (The trees in the photographs were growing along a stream and were not burned during the study.) (a) Before a controlled burn. A prairie that has not burned for several years has a high proportion of detritus (dead grass). (b) During. The detritus serves as fuel for fires. (c) After. Prairies regrow rapidly after a fire burns the detritus. Approximately one month after the controlled burn, virtually all of the biomass in this prairie was living.

The marine communities called coral reefs are subject to a variety of physical disturbances associated with tropical storms. At Heron Island Reef, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland, Australia, ecologists used sequential sets of photographs to chronicle changes in coral cover at specific sites over a 30-year period. The scientists measured the area covered by colonies of live coral to estimate the abundance of the coral animals (see Chapter 33). The researchers also measured the "recruitment" of coral animal larvae that settle and found new colonies.

Violent storms were the main type of disturbance to Heron Island Reef, and the amount of damage caused by these cyclones depended on the position of the coral colonies on the reef (FIGURE 53.17). Sites exposed more to the open ocean were more subject to wave damage than sites sheltered by the island. Five cyclones passed near Heron Island during the 30 years of study from 1962 to 1992. Of the four study areas graphed in FIGURE 53.17, only the protected area of the inner flat was relatively unaffected by cyclones. Almost every cyclone caused a reduction in coral cover in the exposed pools. The 1972 cyclone completely removed coral cover on the exposed crest ("peak" of the reef), the most severe disturbance observed. Recovery on the exposed crest was slow for the next 25 years.

Fig 53-17. Storm disturbance to coral reef communities. The graphs compare how five tropical cyclones (red arrows) affected coral cover at four regions of the Heron Island Reef in Australia. Damage from cyclones was highly variable, depending on how well the island protected the four sites. (The gradual decline in coral cover at the protected sites was a normal effect of the coral's upward growth, which increased the exposure of these sites to air over the 30 years of the study.)

Recruitment rates of new corals settling on free surfaces were highly variable, and this is typical of many marine invertebrates whose larvae drift in the plankton before settling. During the 30-year Heron Island Reef study, there were no particularly good or bad years for coral recruitment for an area as a whole. Recruitment rate was partly associated with how much free space there was in different areas. Coral larvae need free space to settle because they cannot attach to other living coral or to seaweeds.

What emerges from this case study is a picture of a coral community that changes continually because of the disturbance caused by tropical cyclones and the internal processes of growth and recruitment. Coral reefs are good examples of nonequilibrium communities. And there is mounting evidence that some amount of nonequilibrium resulting from disturbance is the norm for most communities. Communities are often in some state of recovery from disturbance.

We tend to think of disturbance as having a negative impact on communities, but this is not always the case. Small-scale disturbances sometimes enhance environmental patchiness, which can be important to the maintenance of species diversity in a community. Frequent small-scale disturbances can also prevent large-scale disturbances. The major fires that occurred in Yellowstone National Park during the summer of 1988 are an example of what can happen in the absence of smaller disturbances. Much of this park was dominated by lodgepole pine, a tree that requires the rejuvenating influence of periodic fires. Lodgepole cones remain closed until exposed to intense heat. When a forest fire destroys the parent trees, the cones open and the seeds are released. The new generation of lodgepole pines can then thrive on nutrients released from the burned trees and on the direct sunlight that was blocked by the old forest. Lodgepole pines that are over 100 years old become increasingly flammable, but for decades, fire suppression by humans had prevented small lightning-induced fires in Yellowstone Park that would have resulted in patches of less flammable trees. As a result, by 1988, about one-third of the Yellowstone trees were 250 to 300 years old. The drought conditions of 1988, combined with the fuel that had accumulated in the forests, resulted in a large-scale fire that destroyed the old lodgepole forests. Demonstrating that communities can often respond very rapidly to even such massive disturbance, burned areas in Yellowstone were largely covered with new vegetation the following year (FIGURE 53.18).

This photo of the same general area taken the following year indicates how rapidly the com-munity began to recover. A variety of herbaceous plants, different from the species that inhabited the floor of the former forest, cover the ground.





 Humans are the most widespread agents of disturbance

Of all the animals, humans have the greatest impact on communities worldwide. Logging and clearing for urban development, mining, and farming have reduced large tracts of forests to small patches of disconnected woodlots in many parts of the United States and throughout Europe. Similarly, agricultural development has disrupted what were once the vast grasslands of the North American prairie. After forests are clear-cut and left alone, weedy and shrubby vegetation often colonizes the area and dominates it for many years. This type of vegetation is also found extensively in agricultural fields that are no longer under cultivation and in vacant lots and construction sites that are periodically cleared. Human disturbance of communities is by no means limited to the United States and Europe; nor is it a recent problem. Tropical rain forests are quickly disappearing as a result of clear-cutting for lumber and pastureland. And centuries of overgrazing and agricultural disturbance have contributed to the current famine in parts of Africa by turning seasonal grasslands into great barren areas.

Human disturbance usually reduces species diversity in communities. We currently use about 60%  of Earth's land in one way or another, mostly as cropland, forest, and rangeland. Most crops are grown in monocultures, intensive cultivations of a single plant variety over large areas. Even forests used to produce pulpwood and lumber are often replanted in single-species stands. And the effects of intensive grazing on rangelands often include the removal of several native plant species and replacement with only a few introduced species. In Chapter 55, we will take a closer look at how community disturbance by human activities is affecting the diversity of life.





 Ecological succession is the sequence of community changes after a disturbance

Changes in community composition and structure are most apparent after some disturbance, such as a large fire or a volcanic eruption, strips away the existing vegetation. The disturbed area may be colonized by a variety of species, which are gradually replaced by a succession of other species. Such transitions in species composition over ecological time represent a process called ecological succession. The process is called primary succession if it begins in a virtually lifeless area where soil has not yet formed, such as on a new volcanic island or on the rubble (moraine) left behind by a retreating glacier. Often the only life-forms initially present are autotrophic bacteria. Lichens and mosses, which grow from windblown spores, are commonly the first macroscopic photosynthesizers to colonize such areas. Soil develops gradually, as rocks weather and organic matter accumulates from the decomposed remains of the early colonizers. Once soil is present, the lichens and mosses are usually overgrown by other plants, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees that sprout from seeds blown in from nearby areas or carried in by animals. Eventually, an area may be colonized by plants that become the community's prevalent form of vegetation. For primary succession to produce such a community may take hundreds or thousands of years.

Secondary succession occurs where an existing community has been cleared by some disturbance that leaves the soil intact. Succession in Yellowstone following the 1988 fires is an example (see FIGURE 53.18). Often the area begins to return to something like its original state. For instance, forested areas that are cleared for farming will, if abandoned, undergo secondary succession and may eventually return to forest. The earliest plants to recolonize such an area are often herbaceous species that grow from windblown or animal-borne seeds. If the area is not burned or heavily grazed, woody shrubs may in time replace most of the herbaceous species, and forest trees may eventually replace most of the shrubs.

Three key processes may be involved in succession between the early arrivals and the later arriving species. The early arrivals may facilitate, or contribute to, the appearance of the later species by making the environment more favorable for the later species. For example, they might make the soil more fertile. Alternatively, the early species may inhibit establishment of the later species, so that the later species colonize successfully in spite of, rather than because of, the activities of the early species. Finally, the early species may be completely independent of the later species, so that they tolerate the later species but do not help or hinder colonization by the later arrivals. Let's look at how these various processes contribute to primary succession in one specific example.

During the past 300 years, there has been a gradual retreat of glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. As the glaciers retreat, they leave moraines. Researchers can determine the age of these postglaciation areas of moraine from the age of the new trees growing on the moraine or, in the last 80 years, by direct observation. Ecologists have conducted the most extensive research on moraine succession at Glacier Bay, in southeastern Alaska. Since about 1760, the glaciers there have retreated about 98 km, an extraordinary retreat rate of almost 400 m per year (FIGURE 53.19). Rocky moraines form a nearly pristine but harsh environment for plants to colonize.

Fig 53-19. A glacial retreat in southeastern Alaska. The dated locations chronicle recession of the glacier since 1760. The broken lines show the approximate edge of the ice in 1760 and 1860, based on historical descriptions. As the ice retreats, it leaves moraines along the edge of the bay (left inset). Primary succession occurs on the moraines (right inset).

TABLE 53.2 summarizes the pattern of succession on the moraines in Glacier Bay. The exposed moraine is colonized first by pioneering plant species--mosses, fireweed, Dryas (a herbaceous angiosperm), willows, and cottonwood. In a few decades, the area is invaded by alder (Alnus), which eventually forms dense, pure thickets up to 9 m tall. These alder stands are later invaded by Sitka spruce, which, after another century, forms a dense forest. Western hemlock and mountain hemlock invade the spruce stands, and after another century, the community is a spruce-hemlock forest. This forest, however, will endure on well-drained slopes only. In areas of poor drainage, the forest floor of this spruce-hemlock forest is invaded by sphagnum mosses, which hold large amounts of water and acidify the soil. With the spread of conditions associated with sphagnum, the trees die because the soil is waterlogged and too oxygen-deficient to sustain the trees' roots, and the area becomes a sphagnum bog. Thus, by about 300 years after glacial retreat, the vegetation consists of sphagnum bogs on the poorly drained flat areas and spruce-hemlock forest on the well-drained slopes.

The bare soil exposed as the glacier retreats is quite basic, with a pH of 8.0-8.4 because of the carbonates contained in the parent rocks. The soil pH falls rapidly with the arrival of vegetation, and the rate of change depends on the vegetation type. The most striking change is caused by alder, which reduces the pH from 8.0 to 5.0 in 30 to 50 years. The leaves of alder are slightly acidic, and as they decompose, they become even more acidic. As the spruce begins to take over from the alder, the pH stabilizes at about 5.0, and it does not change for the next 150 years.

The soil concentrations of mineral nutrients also show marked changes with time. FIGURE 53.20, for example, shows the changes in soil nitrogen levels. One of the characteristic features of the bare soil after glacial retreat is its low nitrogen content. Almost all the pioneer species begin the succession with very poor growth and yellow leaves due to inadequate nitrogen supply. The exceptions to this are Dryas and, particularly, alder; these species have symbiotic bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen (see Chapter 37). Soil nitrogen increases rapidly during the alder stage of succession. The spruce forest develops by spending the capital of soil nitrogen accumulated by the alder. But because spruce trees do not have nitrogen-fixing symbionts, the concentration of soil nitrogen declines again.

Fig 53-20. Change in soil nitrogen concentration during succession after glacial retreat in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Plant succession is shown along the top.

Both inhibition and facilitation factor into primary succession on glacial moraines. One way to test experimentally for these processes is to sow seeds of the later successional species into the earlier stages of succession. When seeds of alder and Sitka spruce were sown into the early successional stages at Glacier Bay, they were inhibited in their germination, and the survival of seedlings that did geminate was reduced. Inhibition seems to be the dominant process in the early successional stages. But once alder and Dryas have enriched the soil with nitrogen, Sitka spruce uses this nitrogen for growth, so it is facilitated by the pioneer species. The pioneer plants alter the soil properties, which in turn permit new species to grow, and these species in turn alter the environment in different ways, contributing to succession.





 Community biodiversity measures the number of species and their relative abundance

The biodiversity of a community--the variety of different kinds of organisms that make up the community--has two components. One is species richness, or the total number of different species in the community. The other is the relative abundance of the different species. For example, imagine two small forest communities, each with 100 individuals distributed among four different tree species (A, B, C, and D) as follows:

Community 1: 25A, 25B, 25C, 25D

Community 2: 80A, 10B, 5C, 5D

The species richness is the same for both communities because they both contain four species, but the relative abundance is very different (FIGURE 53.21). You would easily notice the four different types of trees in community 1, but without looking carefully, you might see only the abundant species A in the second forest. Most observers would intuitively describe community 1 as the more diverse of the two communities. Indeed, ecologists measure biodiversity as heterogeneity, which considers both diversity factors: richness and relative abundance.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 53-21. Which forest is more diverse? Both forests have the same four tree species (A, B, C, and D). Thus, the two communities are equal in their species richness of trees. But if we factor in the relative abundance of species, then community 1 seems more diverse because of the more equitable representation of the different tree species. Ecologists would say that community 1 has greater heterogeneity, a measure of diversity that includes both species number (richness) and relative abundance.

Counting species in a community to determine their number and relative abundances is easier said than done, especially for insects and other small organisms. The counts usually involve sampling techniques. But sample sizes are generally small, leading to large sampling errors, because most species in a community are relatively rare. FIGURE 53.22 illustrates this problem for a study of butterfly and moth biodiversity in a community. And measuring biodiversity is relatively easy when we are counting birds and butterflies. It is much harder to count the less charismatic members of communities, such as mites and nematodes.



Click image to enlarge



Fig 53-22. Relative abundance of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) captured in a light trap in Rothamsted, England. The trap caught a total of 6,814 individuals, representing 197 species. The six most common species accounted for 50 percent of the total catch. In fact, a single species accounted for 1,799 of the 6,814 moths (note that this most common species is "off-scale" on the graph, which does not extend much beyond species represented by about 40 individuals). The main point of the graph is that the majority of species are rare. For example, 37 of the 197 total species were represented in the catch by only a single specimen.

Challenging as it is to measure biodiversity in a community--even for just one taxonomic category, such as butterflies--it is very important work. Measuring biodiversity is essential for conservation biology, since we need an inventory of what we hope to protect. Though there is a tendency in biology to focus on individual species, community ecologists tend to lump the species into broader categories, such as the bird species or the tree species of an area. We can use this community-based approach to look for large-scale patterns in the biogeography of biodiversity.





 Species richness generally declines along an equatorial-polar gradient

Tropical habitats support much larger numbers of species of plants, animals, and other organisms than do temperate and polar regions. A few examples from biodiversity studies will illustrate this global gradient. A 50 ha (1 hectare = 10,000 m2) plot of tropical rain forest in Malaysia contained 830 species of trees, and a 6.6 ha area in Sarawak (in Malaysia) contained 711 tree species. Contrast this richness with a deciduous forest in Michigan, which contained 10 to 15 species on a plot of 2 ha. And the whole of Europe north of the Alps has only 50 tree species. Ants are also much more diverse in the tropics. There are over 200 species of ants in Brazil, 73 species in Iowa, and 7 species in Alaska. There are 293 species of snakes in Mexico, 126 in the United States, and 22 in Canada. FIGURE 53.23 maps the number of breeding land bird species in different parts of North and Central America. Over 600 bird species occur in Central America, while arctic Canada has less than 40 species of birds. Freshwater fishes have their greatest diversity in tropical rivers and lakes. Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi in East Africa contain about 1,450 species of fishes. Over 1,000 species of fishes have been found in the Amazon River in South America, and exploration is still incomplete in this region. In contrast, Central America has 456 fish species, and the Great Lakes of North America have 173 species. Lake Baikal, in Asia, has 39 fish species; and Great Bear Lake, in northwestern Canada, has only 14 species of fishes.

What causes these equatorial-polar gradients in species richness? The two key factors are probably evolutionary history and climate. On the scale of evolutionary time, species diversity may increase in a community because more speciation events have occurred. And tropical communities are generally older than temperate or polar communities. This age difference is partly a consequence of the much longer growing season in the tropics. The growing season in tropical forests is about five times longer than the growing season in the tundra communities of high latitudes. In effect, biological time, and hence time for speciation, runs about five times faster in the tropics than near the poles. And many polar and temperate communities have had to "start over" several times as a result of major disturbance in the form of glaciations.

Most ecologists see climate as the major explanation for the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity. And the two main climatic factors correlated with biodiversity are solar energy input and water availability. Solar energy is the source of both light and heat, two variables that impact the growth of vegetation. The water factor includes both precipitation and humidity.

One way to integrate the energy and water factors of climate is to measure the rate of a community's evapotranspiration, the evaporation of water from soil plus the transpiration of water from plants (see Chapter 36). Evapotranspiration is much higher in hot areas with abundant rainfall than in areas with low temperatures or low precipitation. The species richness of both plants and animals correlates with evapotranspiration (FIGURE 53.24).

Species richness of (a) trees and (b) vertebrates from North America are related to annual available energy at each site, measured by evapotranspiration (which combines solar radiation and temperature). The evapotranspiration values are expressed as their rainfall equivalents in millimeters per year.





 Species richness is related to a community's geographic size

One of the earliest biodiversity patterns that scientists recognized is called the species-area curve, which quantifies what probably seems obvious: The larger the geographic area of a community we sample, the greater the number of species. Alexander von Humboldt first described this relationship in 1807, based on his explorations. The probable explanation for species-area curves is that larger areas offer a greater diversity of habitats and microhabitats (see Chapter 50). In conservation biology, developing species-area curves for key taxa in a community makes it possible to predict how loss of a certain area of habitat is likely to affect biodiversity.

FIGURE 53.25 (p. 1194) is a species-area curve for the breeding birds of North America. The slope indicates the extent to which species richness increases with community area. The slopes of different species-area curves vary, depending on the taxon being sampled in the biodiversity survey and the type of community. But the basic concept of increasing diversity with increasing area applies in a variety of situations, from surveys of ant diversity in New Guinea to the number of plant species on islands of different sizes. In fact, island biogeography provides some of the best examples of species-area curves.

 Species richness on islands depends on island size and distance from the mainland

Because of their limited size and isolation, islands provide excellent opportunities for studying some of the biogeographic factors that affect the species diversity of communities. By "islands," we mean not only oceanic islands, but also habitat islands on land, such as lakes, mountain peaks separated by lowlands, or natural woodland fragments surrounded by areas disturbed by humans--in other words, any patch surrounded by an environment not suitable for the "island" species. In the 1960s, American ecologists Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson developed a general hypothesis of island biogeography to identify the important determinants of species diversity on an island with a given set of physical characteristics.

Imagine a newly formed oceanic island some distance from a mainland that will serve as a source of colonizing species. Two factors will determine the number of species that eventually inhabit the island: the rate at which new species immigrate to the island and the rate at which species become extinct on the island. And two physical features of the island affect immigration and extinction rates: its size and its distance from the mainland. Small islands will generally have lower immigration rates, because potential colonizers are less likely to reach a small island. For example, birds blown out to sea by a storm are more likely to land by chance on a larger island than on a small one. Small islands will also have higher extinction rates. They generally contain fewer resources and less diverse habitats for colonizing species to partition, increasing the likelihood of chance losses. Distance from the mainland is also important; for two islands of equal size, a closer island will have a higher immigration rate than one farther away.

The immigration and extinction rates are also affected at any given time by the number of species already present on the island. As the number of species on the island increases, the immigration rate of new species decreases, because any individual reaching the island is less likely to represent a species that is not already present. At the same time, as more species inhabit an island, extinction rates on the island increase because of the greater likelihood of competitive exclusion.

These relationships that make up MacArthur and Wilson's hypothesis of island biogeography are summarized in FIGURE 53.26. Immigration and extinction rates are plotted as a function of the number of species present on the island. The main prediction of this model is that eventually an equilibrium will be reached where the rate of species immigration matches the rate of species extinction. The number of species at this equilibrium point is correlated with the island's size and distance from the mainland. Any ecological equilibrium, of course, is dynamic; immigration and extinction continue, and the exact species composition may change over time.

MacArthur and Wilson's studies of the diversity of plants and animals on many island chains, such as the Gal&eacute;pagos Islands, support the prediction that species richness increases with island size, in keeping with species-area theory (FIGURE 53.27). Species counts also fit the prediction that the number of species decreases with increasing remoteness of the island.

In the past several decades, the island biogeography hypothesis has come under considerable fire as an oversimplification. Its predictions of equilibria in the species composition of communities may apply in only a limited number of cases and over relatively short time periods, where colonization is the main process affecting species composition. Over a longer period, abiotic disturbances such as storms, adaptive evolutionary changes, and speciation generally alter the species composition and community structure on islands. More important than whether the island biogeography hypothesis has widespread applicability is that it stimulated discussion and research on the effects of habitat size on species diversity, a topic of vital importance for conservation biology, to which we will turn when we discuss habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss in Chapter 55.

An ecosystem consists of all the organisms living in a community as well as all the abiotic factors with which they interact. As with populations and communities, the boundaries of ecosystems are usually not discrete. Ecosystems can range from a microcosm, such as the terrarium you see here, to lakes and forests. Many ecologists regard the entire biosphere as a global ecosystem, a composite of all the local ecosystems on Earth. The biosphere, or whole-earth ecosystem, is the most inclusive level in the hierarchy of biological organization (seeFIGURE 1.2).

The dynamics of an ecosystem involve two processes that cannot be fully described at lower organizational levels: energy flow and chemical cycling. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight. It is then converted to chemical energy by autotrophic organisms, passed to heterotrophs in the organic compounds of food, and dissipated in the form of heat. Chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen are cycled between abiotic and biotic components of the ecosystem. Photosynthetic organisms assimilate these elements in inorganic form from the air, soil, and water and incorporate them into organic molecules, some of which are consumed by animals. The elements are returned in inorganic form to the air, soil, and water by the metabolism of plants and animals and by other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, that break down organic wastes and dead organisms. The movements of energy and matter through ecosystems are related because both occur by the transfer of substances through photosynthesis and feeding relationships. However, because energy, unlike matter, cannot be recycled, an ecosystem must be powered by a continuous influx of new energy from an external source (the sun). Energy flows through ecosystems, while matter cycles within them.

This chapter describes the dynamics of energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems and considers some of the consequences of human intrusions into these processes.





THE ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO ECOLOGY

 

 Trophic relationships determine the routes of energy flow and chemical cycling in an ecosystem



 

 Decomposition connects all trophic levels



 

 The laws of physics and chemistry apply to ecosystems



Ecosystem ecologists view ecosystems as energy machines and matter processors. By grouping the species in a community into trophic levels of feeding relationships, we can follow the transformation of energy in the whole ecosystem and map the movements of chemical elements as they are used by the biotic community. As we discussed in Chapter 53, ecologists divide species into trophic levels on the basis of their main source of nutrition and energy.





PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 An ecosystem's energy budget depends on primary production



 

 In aquatic ecosystems, light and nutrients limit primary production



 

 In terrestrial ecosystems, temperature, moisture, and nutrients limit primary production



The amount of light energy converted to chemical energy (organic compounds) by an ecosystem's autotrophs during a given time period is called primary production. This photosynthetic product is the starting point for studies of ecosystem metabolism and energy flow.





SECONDARY PRODUCTION IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 The efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually less than 20% 



 

 Herbivores consume a small percentage of vegetation: the green world hypothesis



The amount of chemical energy in consumers' food that is converted to their own new biomass during a given time period is called the secondary production of the ecosystem. Consider the transfer of organic matter from producers to herbivores, the primary consumers. In most ecosystems, herbivores manage to eat only a small fraction of the plant material produced. And they cannot digest all the plant material that they do eat, as anyone who has walked through a dairy farm will attest. Thus, much of primary production is not used by consumers. Let us analyze this process of energy transfer more closely.





THE CYCLING OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN ECOSYSTEMS

 

 Biological and geologic processes move nutrients between organic and inorganic compartments



 

 Decomposition rates largely determine the rates of nutrient cycling



 

 Nutrient cycling is strongly regulated by vegetation



Although ecosystems receive an essentially inexhaustible influx of solar energy, chemical elements are available only in limited amounts. (The meteorites that occasionally strike Earth are the only extraterrestrial source of matter.) Life on Earth therefore depends on the recycling of essential chemical elements. Even while an individual organism is alive, much of its chemical stock is rotated continuously as nutrients are assimilated and waste products released. Atoms present in the complex molecules of an organism at its time of death are returned as simpler compounds to the atmosphere, water, or soil by the action of decomposers. This decomposition replenishes the pools of inorganic nutrients that plants and other autotrophs use to build new organic matter. Because nutrient circuits involve both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems, they are also called biogeochemical cycles.





HUMAN IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THE BIOSPHERE

 

 The human population is disrupting chemical cycles throughout the biosphere



 

 Combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of acid precipitation



 

 Toxins can become concentrated in successive trophic levels of food webs



 

 Human activities may be causing climate change by increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere



 

 Human activities are depleting atmospheric ozone



As the human population has grown in size, our activities and technological capabilities have intruded in one way or another into the dynamics of most ecosystems. Even where we have not completely destroyed a natural system, our actions have disrupted the trophic structure, energy flow, and chemical cycling of ecosystems in most areas of the world. The effects are sometimes local or regional, but the ecological impact of humans can be widespread or even global. For example, acidic gases may be carried by prevailing winds and fall as acid rain hundreds or thousands of miles from the smokestacks emitting the gases.





 Trophic relationships determine the routes of energy flow and chemical cycling in an ecosystem

The trophic level that ultimately supports all others in an ecosystem consists of autotrophs, the primary producers of the ecosystem. Most autotrophs are photosynthetic organisms that use light energy to synthesize sugars and other organic compounds, which they then use as fuel for cellular respiration and as building material for growth. Plants, algae, and photosynthetic prokaryotes are the biosphere's main autotrophs, although chemoautotrophic prokaryotes are the primary producers in certain ecosystems, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents (see FIGURE 50.23).

Organisms in trophic levels above the primary producers are heterotrophs, which directly or indirectly depend on the photosynthetic output of primary producers. Herbivores, which eat primary producers (plants or algae), are the primary consumers. Carnivores that eat herbivores are secondary consumers, and carnivores that eat other carnivores are tertiary consumers. Another important group of heterotrophs consists of the detritivores. Detritivores, or decomposers, are consumers that get their energy from detritus, which is nonliving organic material, such as the remains of dead organisms, feces, fallen leaves, and wood. Decomposers play a central role in material cycling (FIGURE 54.1).

Fig 54-1. An overview of ecosystem dynamics. This generalized scheme traces energy flow (broken red lines) and material cycling (solid blue lines) in ecosystems. Energy flow starts from the sun as solar radiation, moves as chemical energy transfers in the food web, and finishes as heat radiated into space. Materials flow through the trophic levels eventually to detritus and then cycle back to the primary producers.





 Decomposition connects all trophic levels

The fungi, bacteria, invertebrates, and vertebrates that feed as detritivores often form a major link between the primary producers and the consumers in an ecosystem. In streams, for example, much of the organic material that is used by consumers is supplied by terrestrial plants and enters the ecosystem as leaves and other debris that fall into the water or are washed in by runoff. A crayfish might feed on this plant detritus and associated bacteria and fungi at the bottom of a stream and then be eaten by a fish. In a forest, birds might feed on earthworms that have been feeding on leaf litter and its associated bacteria and fungi in the soil. But even more important than this channeling of resources from producers to consumers is the role that detritivores play in making vital chemical elements available to producers.

The organic material that makes up the living organisms in an ecosystem gets recycled. Detritivores break down (decompose) the organic material and recycle the chemical elements in inorganic forms to abiotic reservoirs such as soil, water, and air. Plants and other producers can then reassimilate these elements into organic matter. All organisms perform some decomposition, breaking down organic molecules during cellular respiration, for example. But an ecosystem's main decomposers are prokaryotes and fungi, which secrete enzymes that digest organic material and then absorb the breakdown products (FIGURE 54.2). Accounting for most of the conversion of organic materials from all trophic levels into inorganic compounds usable by autotrophs, decomposition by prokaryotes and fungi links all trophic levels. Decomposition is the most unappreciated of all ecological processes because prokaryotes and most fungi are not readily visible to the human eye. Yet if decomposition stopped, all life on Earth would cease. The interconnectedness of trophic levels is one of ecosystem ecology's important lessons.

 The laws of physics and chemistry apply to ecosystems

Much of an ecologist's analysis of ecosystem dynamics comes from well-established laws of physics and chemistry. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed (see Chapter 6). This means that for all ecosystems, we can potentially trace energy exactly from its input as solar radiation to its release as heat from organisms. Plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert solar energy to chemical energy, but the total amount of energy does not change. The total amount of energy stored in organic molecules plus the amount reflected and dissipated as heat must equal the total incident energy in the form of sunlight. One important objective of ecosystem ecology is to compute such energy budgets and trace the energy flow in particular ecosystems.

The second law of thermodynamics tells us that energy conversions cannot be completely efficient--that some energy will be lost; as heat in any conversion process (see Chapter 6). This idea suggests that we can measure the efficiency of ecological energy conversions in the same way we measure the efficiency of light bulbs and car engines.

While energy in ecosystems is dissipated ultimately as heat into outer space, chemical elements are continually recycled. A unit of energy moves through the trophic structure of an ecosystem only once, and without the sun providing continuous energy to Earth, ecosystems would vanish. In contrast, a carbon or nitrogen atom moves from trophic level to trophic level and eventually to the decomposers and then back again in endless cycles. Elements are not lost on a global scale, although they may move out of one ecosystem and into another. The measurement and analysis of these cycles of chemical elements in ecosystems and in the entire biosphere are an important part of ecosystem ecology.

Now that we have considered energy flow and material cycling in the context of trophic structures, let's take a closer look at these dynamics, beginning with the producers.





 An ecosystem's energy budget depends on primary production

Most primary producers use light energy to synthesize energy-rich organic molecules, which can subsequently be broken down to generate ATP (see Chapter 10). Consumers acquire their organic fuels secondhand (or even third- or fourthhand) through food webs. Therefore, the extent of photosynthetic production sets the spending limit for the energy budget of the entire ecosystem.

The Global Energy Budget

Every day, Earth is bombarded by about 1022 joules of solar radiation (1 J = 0.239 cal). This is the energy equivalent of 100 million atomic bombs. As described in Chapter 50, the intensity of the solar energy striking Earth and its atmosphere varies with latitude, with the tropics receiving the highest input. Most solar radiation is absorbed, scattered, or reflected by the atmosphere in an asymmetrical pattern determined by variations in cloud cover and the quantity of dust in the air over different regions. The amount of solar radiation reaching the surface of the globe ultimately limits the photosynthetic output of ecosystems.

Much of the solar radiation that reaches the biosphere lands on bare ground and bodies of water that either absorb or reflect the incoming energy. Only a small fraction actually strikes algae, photosynthetic prokaryotes, and plant leaves, and only some of this is of wavelengths suitable for photosynthesis. Of the visible light that does reach photosynthetic organisms, only about 1%  is converted to chemical energy by photosynthesis, and this efficiency varies with the type of organism, light level, and other factors. Although the fraction of the total incoming solar radiation that is ultimately trapped by photosynthesis is very small, primary producers on Earth collectively create about 170 billion tons of organic material per year--an impressive quantity.

Gross and Net Primary Production

Total primary production is known as gross primary production (GPP)--the amount of light energy that is converted to chemical energy by photosynthesis per unit time. Not all of this production is stored as organic material in the growing plants, because the plants use some of the molecules as fuel in their own cellular respiration. Net primary production (NPP) is equal to gross primary production minus the energy used by the primary producers for respiration (R): 

Net primary production is the measurement of greatest interest to ecologists because it represents the storage of chemical energy that will be available to consumers in an ecosystem. In forests, net production may be as little as one-fourth that of gross production. Trees have larger masses of stems, branches, and roots to support through respiration than do herbs; thus, less energy is lost to respiration in herbaceous and crop communities than in forests.

Primary production can be expressed in terms of energy per unit area per unit time (J/m2/yr) or as biomass (weight) of vegetation added to the ecosystem per unit area per unit time (g/m2/yr). Biomass is usually expressed in terms of the dry weight of organic material because water molecules contain no usable energy and because the water content of plants varies over short periods of time. An ecosystem's primary production should not be confused with the total biomass of photosynthetic autotrophs present at a given time, called the standing crop. Primary production is the amount of new biomass added in a given period of time. Although a forest has a very large standing crop biomass, its primary production may actually be less than that of some grasslands, which do not accumulate vegetation because animals consume the plants rapidly and because some of the plants are annuals.

Different ecosystems vary considerably in their production as well as in their contribution to the total production on Earth (FIGURE 54.3). Tropical rain forests are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystems, and because they cover a large portion of Earth, they contribute a large proportion of the planet's overall production. Estuaries and coral reefs also have very high production, but their total contribution to global production is relatively small because these ecosystems are not very extensive. The open ocean contributes more primary production than any other ecosystem, but this is because of its very large size; production per unit area is relatively low. Deserts and tundra also have low production. Satellite images of the globe now provide a means of studying global patterns of primary production (FIGURE 54.4, p. 1202). The most striking impression from these global satellite maps is how unproductive most of the oceans are, in contrast to the high production of tropical forest regions.

(a) The geographic extent and (b) the production per unit area of different ecosystems determine their total contribution to (c) worldwide primary production. Open ocean, for example, contributes a lot to the planet's production despite its low production per unit area because of its large size, whereas tropical rain forest contributes a lot because of its high production. (Aquatic ecosystems are color-coded blue in these histographs; terrestrial ecosystems are green.)

The values on the color key are grams of carbon per square meter per year. Ocean data are averages from 1978 to 1983. Land averages are from 1982 to 1990. Of total global primary production, the ocean contributes 46%  and the land 54% .





 In aquatic ecosystems, light and nutrients limit primary production

What controls primary production in ecosystems? To ask this question another way, what factors could we change to increase or decrease primary production for a given ecosystem? We will look first at the factors that limit production in aquatic ecosystems, beginning with marine ecosystems.

Production in Marine Ecosystems

Light is the first variable one might expect to control primary production in oceans, since solar radiation drives photosynthesis. The depth to which light penetrates the ocean affects primary production throughout the photic zone (see FIGURE 50.22). More than half of the solar radiation is absorbed in the first meter of water. Even in "clear" water, only 5-10%  of the radiation may reach a depth of 20 m.

If light is the primary variable limiting primary production in the ocean, we would expect production to increase along a gradient from the poles toward the equator, which receives the greatest intensity of light (see FIGURE 50.11). However, you can see that there is no such gradient by reexamining FIGURE 54.4. Some parts of the tropics and subtropics, such as the Sargasso Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the central part of the North Pacific, are very unproductive. In contrast, the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Alaska, and the Southern Ocean off New Zealand are relatively productive areas.

Why are tropical oceans less productive than we would expect from their high year-round intensity of illumination? It is actually nutrients more than light that limit primary production in different geographic regions of the ocean. Ecologists use the term limiting nutrient for the nutrient that must be added for production to increase. And two elements, nitrogen and phosphorus, are the nutrients that most often limit marine production. In the open ocean, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are very low in the photic (upper) zone, where phytoplankton live. Ironically, the nutrient supply is much better in deeper water, where it is too dark for photosynthesis (FIGURE 54.5).

Fig 54-5. Vertical distribution of temperature, nutrients, and production in the upper layer of the central North Pacific during summer. The curves are composites of several vertical profiles made over a two-day period at a single location (28&#176;N, 155&#176;W). Chlorophyll is a measure of phytoplankton density. The broken line illustrates the depth of 1%  of surface light (the traditional definition of the depth of the photic zone). Note that nitrate has been depleted to undetectable levels in the photic zone, but that most of the primary production (measured from 14C uptake) takes place in that nutrient-depleted zone because of the requirement for light.

Nitrogen is the one nutrient that limits phytoplankton growth in many parts of the ocean. FIGURE 54.6 illustrates an experimental test of nitrogen versus phosphorus as the limiting factor for production in coastal waters off the south shore of Long Island, New York. Pollution from duck farms along the bays of Long Island adds both nitrogen and phosphorus to the coastal water; but unlike phosphorus, the nitrogen is immediately taken up by algae, and no trace of free nitrogen can be measured in the coastal waters. Nutrient enrichment experiments confirmed that nitrogen was limiting phytoplankton growth. The addition of nitrogen (in the form of ammonium) caused a heavy algal growth in bay water, but the addition of phosphate did not induce algal growth. There are some practical applications of this work, including the prevention of algal blooms caused by pollution that fertilizes the phytoplankton. If nitrogen is the factor now limiting phytoplankton production in the coastal zone, the elimination of phosphates from sewage will not help the problem of coastal pollution unless we first control nitrogen pollution.

Fig 54-6. Experiments on nutrient limitations to phytoplankton production in coastal waters of Long Island.

Although nitrogen availability generally limits primary production in marine ecosystems, there are some anomalies. Several large areas of the ocean have low phytoplankton densities in spite of relatively high nitrogen concentrations. For example, in the Sargasso Sea, a subtropical region of the Atlantic Ocean, the water is among the most transparent in the world because of a very low density of phytoplankton. When researchers conducted a series of nutrient enrichment experiments, they found that it was availability of the micronutrient iron that limited primary production, not nitrogen or phosphorus (TABLE 54.1).

The researchers spread low concentrations of dissolved iron over 72 km2 of ocean and then measured the change in phytoplankton density over a seven-day period. A massive phytoplankton bloom occurred, as indicated by a 27-fold increase in chlorophyll concentration in water samples from the test sites.

Why are iron concentrations naturally low in certain oceanic regions? Windblown dust from the land is the main process delivering iron to the ocean, and relatively little dust reaches the central Pacific and central Atlantic Oceans.

The iron factor in marine ecosystems is actually related to the nitrogen factor. Where iron is limiting, additions stimulate growth of cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen, converting atmospheric N2 to nitrogenous minerals (see Chapter 27). These nitrogenous nutrients in turn stimulate proliferation of eukaryotic phytoplankton: 

Areas of upwelling in the ocean are the main exceptions to primary production being limited by nutrients. The largest area of upwelling occurs in the Antarctic Ocean, where nutrient-rich deep waters circulate to the surface near the Antarctic continent. Other areas of upwelling are the coastal waters off Peru and California. Because the steady supply of nutrients stimulates phytoplankton production at the base of food webs, areas of upwelling are prime fishing locations.

Marine ecologists are just beginning to piece together the interplay of factors that determine primary production in the oceans. One of the most important technical breakthroughs is the remote sensing of primary production data collected by satellites (FIGURE 54.7).

A spectral instrument estimates chlorophyll concentrations in surface waters and converts the data to contrasting artificial colors. The areas that are green, red, or white in the color-enhanced photo are the richest in chlorophyll and hence phytoplankton. Note the phytoplankton bloom off the west coast of Vancouver Island. The second big bloom, in the sound between the island and the mainland, is due to a plume of nutrient-rich water from the Fraser River.

Production in Freshwater Ecosystems

Solar radiation limits primary production on a day-to-day basis in lakes, and within any given lake, you can predict the daily primary production from the solar radiation for that day. Temperature is closely linked with light intensity in freshwater systems and is difficult to evaluate as a separate factor. Nutrient limitations are also common in freshwater lakes.

During the 1970s, interest in what controls primary production in freshwater lakes became associated with the environmental issue of increasing water pollution. Sewage and fertilizer runoff from farms and yards added nutrients to lakes. This shifted many lakes from having phytoplankton communities dominated by diatoms or green algae to having phytoplankton communities dominated by cyanobacteria. This process, eutrophication, has generally undesirable impacts from a human perspective, including the eventual loss of fish from lakes (see FIGURE 50.19b). Controlling eutrophication requires knowing which polluting nutrient enables the cyanobacteria to bloom. Unlike the situation in marine ecosystems, nitrogen is rarely the limiting factor for primary production in lakes. In the 1970s, David Schindler, whom you met in the interview on p. 1190, conducted a series of whole-lake experiments that pointed to phosphorus as the limiting nutrient that stimulated the cyanobacterial blooms (FIGURE 54.8). His research led to the use of phosphate-free detergents and other water quality reforms.

Fig 54-8. The experimental eutrophication of a lake. The far basin of this lake was separated from the near basin by a plastic curtain and fertilized with inorganic sources of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Within two months, the fertilized basin was covered with a cyanobacterial bloom, which appears white in the photograph. The near basin, which was treated with only carbon and nitrogen, remained unchanged. In this case, phosphorus was the key limiting nutrient, and its addition stimulated the explosive growth of cyanobacteria.





 In terrestrial ecosystems, temperature, moisture, and nutrients limit primary production

Of course, water availability varies more among terrestrial ecosystems than among aquatic ones, but terrestrial ecosystems also vary more in temperature. On a large geographic scale, temperature and moisture are the key factors controlling primary production in ecosystems. Note again in FIGURE 54.3b that tropical rain forests, with their warm, wet conditions that promote plant growth, are the most productive of all terrestrial ecosystems.

On a more local scale, mineral nutrients in the soil can play key roles in limiting primary production in terrestrial ecosystems. Primary production removes soil nutrients, sometimes faster than they are replaced. At some point, a nutrient deficiency may cause plant growth to slow or cease. It is unlikely that all nutrients will be exhausted simultaneously. If a limiting nutrient controls production, adding a nonlimiting nutrient to the soil will not stimulate production. For example, if nitrogen is limiting, then adding phosphorus, even if it, too, is in relatively short supply, will not stimulate production. But if we add nitrogen, this will stimulate plant growth until some other nutrient--say, phosphorus--becomes limiting. In fact, either nitrogen or phosphorus is the soil nutrient that most commonly limits terrestrial production (FIGURE 54.9).

Fig 54-9. Nutrient addition experiments in a Hudson Bay salt marsh. Note that experimental plots receiving phosphorus (P) alone do not outproduce the unfertilized control plots. But adding nitrogen (N) boosts production. Nitrogen is the limiting nutrient, at least until late summer. At this point, phosphorus may become limiting. (What is the basis for this inference?)

Scientific studies relating nutrients to production have practical applications in agriculture. Farmers maximize their crop yields by using fertilizers with the right balance of nutrients for the local soil and the type of crop.





 The efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually less than 20% 

Production Efficiency

One way to start thinking about secondary production is to examine the process in individual organisms. Caterpillars feed on plant leaves, and FIGURE 54.10 is a simplified diagram of how the energy a caterpillar obtains from food is partitioned. Out of 200 J (48 cal) consumed by a caterpillar, only about 33 J (one-sixth) is used for growth. The caterpillar passes the rest as feces or uses it for cellular respiration. The energy contained in the feces is not lost from the ecosystem, as it will be consumed by detritivores. However, the energy used for respiration is lost from the ecosystem as heat. Energy pours into an ecosystem as solar radiation and drains away as respiratory heat loss. This is why energy is said to flow through, not cycle within, ecosystems. Only the chemical energy stored as growth (or the production of offspring) by herbivores is available as food to secondary consumers. And our example actually overestimates the conversion of primary production to secondary production because we did not account for all the plant material that herbivores do not even consume. The greenness of terrestrial landscapes due to an abundance of plant material indicates that most net primary production is not converted over the short term to secondary production.

Fig 54-10. Energy partitioning within a link of the food chain. Less than 17%  of the caterpillar's food is actually converted to caterpillar biomass.

If we view animals as energy transformers, we can ask questions about their relative efficiencies. This is the efficiency measure we'll use: 

Net secondary production is the energy stored in biomass represented by growth and reproduction. Assimilation consists of the total energy taken in and used for growth, reproduction, and respiration. In other words, production efficiency is the fraction of food energy that is not used for respiration. For the caterpillar in FIGURE 54.10, production efficiency is 33% ; 67 J of the 100 J of assimilated energy is used for respiration (note that energy lost as undigestible material in feces does not count as assimilation). Birds and mammals have low production efficiencies, ranging from 1-3% , because they use so much energy to maintain a warm body temperature. Fishes, which are ectotherms (see Chapter 40), have a production efficiency around 10% . Insects are even more efficient, with production efficiencies averaging 40% .

Trophic Efficiency and Ecological Pyramids

Let's scale up now from the production efficiencies of individual consumers to the flow of energy through whole trophic levels.

Trophic efficiency is the percentage of production transferred from one trophic level to the next. Put another way, trophic efficiency is the fraction of net production at one trophic level as a percent of net production at the level below. Trophic efficiencies must always be less than production efficiencies because they take into account not only the energy lost through respiration and materials in feces, but also the energy in organic material in a lower trophic level that is not consumed by the next trophic level. Trophic efficiencies usually range from 5-20% , depending on the type of ecosystem. In other words, 80-95%  of the energy available at one trophic level never transfers to the next. And this loss is multiplied over the length of a food chain. If 10%  of energy is transferred from primary producers to primary consumers, and 10%  of that energy is transferred to secondary consumers, then only 1%  of net primary production is available to secondary consumers (10%  of 10% ).

Pyramids of Production. This multiplicative loss of energy from a food chain can be represented by a pyramid of production, in which the trophic levels are stacked in blocks, with primary producers forming the foundation of the pyramid. The size of each block is proportional to the production of each trophic level (FIGURE 54.11).

Fig 54-11. An idealized pyramid of net production. This example is based on a trophic efficiency of 10%  for each link in the food chain. Notice that primary producers convert only about 1%  of the energy in the sunlight available to them into net primary production.

Pyramids of Biomass. One important ecological consequence of low trophic efficiencies can be represented in a biomass pyramid, in which each tier represents the standing crop (the total dry weight of all organisms) in a trophic level. Most biomass pyramids narrow sharply from primary producers at the base to top-level carnivores at the apex because energy transfers between trophic levels are so inefficient (FIGURE 54.12a). Some aquatic ecosystems, however, have inverted biomass pyramids, with primary consumers outweighing producers. In the waters of the English Channel, for example, the biomass of zooplankton (consumers) is five times the weight of phytoplankton (producers) (FIGURE 54.12b). Such inverted biomass pyramids occur because the zooplankton consume the phytoplankton so quickly that the producers never develop a large population size, or standing crop. Instead, the phytoplankton grow, reproduce, and are consumed rapidly. Phytoplankton have a short turnover time, which means they have a small standing crop biomass compared to their production:  Because the phytoplankton continue to replace their biomass at such a rapid rate, they can support a biomass of zooplankton bigger than their own biomass. Nevertheless, the pyramid of production for this ecosystem is upright, like the one in FIGURE 54.11, because phytoplankton have a much higher production than zooplankton.

Pyramids of Numbers. The multiplicative loss of energy from food chains severely limits the overall biomass of top-level carnivores that any ecosystem can support. Only about one one-thousandth of the chemical energy fixed by photosynthesis can flow all the way through a food web to a tertiary consumer, such as a hawk, snake, or shark (see FIGURE 54.11). This explains why food webs usually include only about four or five trophic levels (see Chapter 53).

Because predators are usually larger than the prey they eat, top-level predators tend to be fairly large animals. Thus, the limited biomass at the top of an ecological pyramid is concentrated in a relatively small number of large individuals. This phenomenon is reflected in a pyramid of numbers, in which the size of each block is proportional to the number of individual organisms present in each trophic level (FIGURE 54.13). Populations of top predators are typically small, and the animals may be widely spaced within their habitats. As a result, many predators are highly susceptible to extinction (as well as to the evolutionary consequences of small population size discussed in Chapter 23).

The dynamics of energy flow through ecosystems have important implications for the human population. Eating meat is a relatively inefficient way of tapping photosynthetic production. A human obtains far more calories by eating grains directly as a primary consumer than by processing that same amount of grain through another trophic level and eating grain-fed animals (beef, chicken, pork, lamb, farm fish). Worldwide agriculture could, in fact, successfully feed many more people than it does today if we all consumed only plant material, feeding more efficiently as primary consumers (FIGURE 54.14).

 Herbivores consume a small percentage of vegetation: the green world hypothesis

With so many primary consumers (herbivores) munching away on plants, how can we explain why most terrestrial ecosystems are actually quite green, boosting large standing crops of vegetation? According to the green world hypothesis, herbivores consume relatively little plant biomass because they are held in check by a variety of factors, including predators, parasites, and disease.

Let's look at some of the numbers that account for a green world. There is a total of about 83 &#160;X&#160; 1010 metric tons of carbon stored in the plant biomass of terrestrial ecosystems. And the global rate of terrestrial primary production is about 5 &#160;X&#160; 1010 metric tons of plant biomass per year. (If you return to the equation on p. 1207, you can now calculate the global turnover rate for Earth's vegetation.) On a global scale, herbivores consume less than 17%  of the total net annual production by plants. Thus, in general, herbivores are only a minor nuisance to plants. We do know that some herbivores have the potential to completely strip local vegetation over the short term; an example is the occasional ability of exploding gypsy moth populations to defoliate areas of forest in the northeastern United States. Such exceptions only heighten our curiosity about why Earth is so green.

The green world hypothesis proposes several factors that keep herbivores in check:

Plants have defenses against herbivores. These defenses include noxious chemicals, as we discussed in Chapter 39.

Nutrients, not energy supply, usually limit herbivores. Animals need certain nutrients, such as organic nitrogen (protein), that plants often supply in relatively small amounts. Even in a world of plentiful green energy, the growth and reproduction of many herbivores is limited by availability of essential nutrients, not by energy (calories; see Chapter 41).

Abiotic factors limit herbivores. Unfavorable seasonal changes in temperature and moisture are examples of abiotic factors that can set a carrying capacity for herbivores far below the number that would strip vegetation.

Intraspecific competition can limit herbivore numbers. Territorial behavior and other consequences of competition may maintain herbivores' population densities below what the vegetation could support with food.

Interspecific interactions check herbivore densities. The green world hypothesis postulates that predators, parasites, and disease are the most important factors limiting the growth of herbivore populations. This applies the top-down model of community structure (Chapter 53).

The relationship of herbivores to plants emphasizes the importance of trophic structure for understanding the dynamics of an ecosystem. We now redirect our focus from energy flow to the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems.





 Biological and geologic processes move nutrients between organic and inorganic compartments

A chemical's specific route through a biogeochemical cycle varies with the particular element and the trophic structure of the ecosystem. We can, however, recognize two general categories of biogeochemical cycles. Gaseous forms of carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen occur in the atmosphere, and cycles of these elements are essentially global. For example, some of the carbon and oxygen atoms a plant acquires from the air as CO2 may have been released into the atmosphere by the respiration of a plant or animal in some distant locale. Other elements that are less mobile in the environment, including phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and the trace elements, generally cycle on a more localized scale, at least over the short term. Soil is the main abiotic reservoir of these elements, which are absorbed by plant roots and eventually returned to the soil by decomposers, usually in the same general vicinity.

A General Model of Chemical Cycling

Before examining the details of individual cycles, let's look at a general model of nutrient cycling that shows the main reservoirs, or compartments, of elements and the processes that transfer elements between reservoirs (FIGURE 54.15). Most nutrients accumulate in four reservoirs, each of which is defined by two characteristics: whether it contains organic or inorganic materials and whether or not the materials are directly available for use by organisms. One compartment of organic materials is composed of the living organisms themselves and detritus; these nutrients are available to other organisms when consumers feed and when detritivores consume nonliving organic matter. The second organic compartment includes "fossilized" deposits of once-living organisms (coal, oil, and peat), from which nutrients cannot be assimilated directly. Material moved from the living organic compartment to the fossilized organic compartment long ago, when organisms died and were buried by sedimentation over millions of years to become coal, oil, or peat.

Fig 54-15. A general model of nutrient cycling. The biological and geologic processes that move nutrients from one compartment reservoir to another are indicated on the arrows.

Nutrients also occur in two inorganic compartments, one in which they are available for use by organisms and one in which they are not. The available inorganic compartment includes matter (elements and compounds) that is dissolved in water or present in soil or air. Organisms assimilate materials from this compartment directly and return chemicals to it through the fairly rapid processes of cellular respiration, excretion, and decomposition. Elements in the unavailable inorganic compartment are tied up in rocks. Although organisms cannot tap into this compartment directly, nutrients slowly become available through weathering and erosion. Similarly, unavailable organic materials move into the available compartment of inorganic nutrients through erosion or when fossil fuels are burned and the exhaust enters the atmosphere.

Describing biogeochemical cycles in general is much simpler than actually tracing elements through these cycles, especially since ecosystems exchange elements with other ecosystems. Even in a pond, which has discrete boundaries, several processes add and remove key nutrients. Minerals dissolved in rainwater or runoff from the neighboring land are added to the pond, as are nutrient-rich pollen, fallen leaves, and other airborne material. And of course, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen cycle between the pond and the atmosphere. Birds may feed on fish or the aquatic larvae of insects, which derived their store of nutrients from the pond, and some of those nutrients may then be excreted or eliminated on land far from the pond's drainage area. Keeping track of the inflow and outflow is even more challenging in less clearly delineated terrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, ecologists have worked out the schemes for chemical cycling in several ecosystems, often by adding tiny amounts of radioactive tracers that enable the researchers to follow chemical elements through the various biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystems.

One important cycle, the water cycle, does not fit the generalized scheme of FIGURE 54.15 very well. Although organisms are mostly made of water, very little of the water that cycles through ecosystems is chemically altered by either the biotic or abiotic components. The main exception is the water that is split into hydrogen and oxygen during photosynthesis, but that involves a very tiny fraction of the total water passing through a plant or any other organism. The water cycle is more a physical process than a chemical one; it mainly involves changes between the liquid and gaseous states and the transport of the liquid water and water vapor (FIGURE 54.16). Contrast the water cycle in FIGURE 54.16 with the carbon cycle (FIGURE 54.17), which fits the generalized scheme of biogeochemical cycles much better. Now let's take a closer look at two specific biogeochemical cycles: the nitrogen cycle and the phosphorus cycle.

Fig 54-16. The water cycle. On a global scale, evaporation exceeds precipitation over the oceans. The result is a net movement of water vapor, carried by the winds, from the ocean to the land. The excess of precipitation over evaporation on land results in the formation of surface and groundwater systems that flow back to the sea, completing the major part of the cycle. Over the sea, evaporation forms most water vapor. On land, however, 90%  or more of the vaporization is due to plant transpira-tion, which together with other types of evaporation is referred to as evapotranspiration. The numbers in this diagram indicate water flow in billion billion (1018) grams per year.

Fig 54-17. The carbon cycle. The reciprocal processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration are responsible for the major transformations and movements of carbon. A seasonal pulse in atmospheric CO2 is caused by decreased photosynthetic activity during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. On a global scale, the return of CO2 to the atmosphere by respiration closely balances its removal by photosynthesis. However, the burning of wood and fossil fuels adds more CO2 to the atmosphere; as a result, the amount of atmospheric CO2 is steadily increasing.

The Nitrogen Cycle

Although Earth's atmosphere is almost 80%  nitrogen, it is mostly in the form of nitrogen gas (N2), which is unavailable to plants and hence to consumers of plants.

Nitrogen enters ecosystems via two natural pathways, the relative importance of which varies greatly from ecosystem to ecosystem. The first, atmospheric deposition, accounts for approximately 5-10%  of the usable nitrogen that enters most ecosystems. In this process, NH4+ and NO3-, the two forms of nitrogen available to plants, are added to soil by being dissolved in rain or by settling as part of fine dust or other particulates. Some plants, such as the epiphytic bromeliads found in the canopy of tropical rain forests, have aerial roots that can take up NH4+ and NO3- directly from the moist atmosphere.

The other natural pathway for nitrogen to enter ecosystems is via nitrogen fixation. Only certain prokaryotes can fix nitrogen--that is, convert N2 to minerals that can be used to synthesize nitrogenous organic compounds such as amino acids. Indeed, prokaryotes are vital links at several points in the nitrogen cycle (FIGURE 54.18). Nitrogen is fixed in terrestrial ecosystems by free-living (nonsymbiotic) soil bacteria as well as by symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in the root nodules of legumes and certain other plants (see Chapter 37). Some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems. Organisms that fix nitrogen are, of course, fulfilling their own metabolic requirements, but the excess ammonia (NH3) they release becomes available to other organisms.

In addition to these natural sources of usable nitrogen, industrial fixation of nitrogen for fertilizer now makes a major contribution to the pool of nitrogenous minerals in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

The direct product of nitrogen fixation is ammonia (NH3). However, most soils are at least slightly acidic, and NH3 released into the soil picks up a hydrogen ion (H+) to form ammonium, NH4+, which can be used directly by plants. Because NH3 is a gas, it can evaporate back to the atmosphere from soils with a pH close to 7 (such as those in the midwestern United States). This NH3 lost from the soil may then form NH4+ in the atmosphere. As a result, NH4+ concentrations in rainfall are correlated with soil pH over large regions. This local recycling of nitrogen by atmospheric deposition can be especially pronounced in agricultural areas where both nitrogen fertilizers and lime (a base that decreases soil acidity) are used extensively.

Although plants can use ammonium directly, most of the ammonium in soil is used by certain aerobic bacteria as an energy source; their activity oxidizes ammonium to nitrite (NO2-) and then to nitrate (NO3-), a process called nitrification. Nitrate released from these bacteria can then be assimilated by plants and converted to organic forms, such as amino acids and proteins. Animals can assimilate only organic nitrogen, and they do this by eating plants or other animals. Some bacteria can obtain the oxygen they need for metabolism from nitrate rather than from O2 under anaerobic conditions. As a result of this denitrification process, some nitrate is converted back to N2, returning to the atmosphere. The decomposition of organic nitrogen back to ammonium, a process called ammonification, is carried out mainly by bacterial and fungal decomposers. This process recycles large amounts of nitrogen to the soil.

Overall, most of the nitrogen cycling in natural systems involves the nitrogenous compounds in soil and water, not atmospheric N2. Although nitrogen fixation is important in the buildup of a pool of available nitrogen, it contributes only a tiny fraction of the nitrogen assimilated annually by total vegetation. Nevertheless, many common species of plants depend on their association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to provide this essential nutrient in a form they can assimilate. The amount of N2 returned to the atmosphere by denitrification is also relatively small. The important point is that although nitrogen exchanges between soil and atmosphere are significant over the long term, the majority of nitrogen in most ecosystems is recycled locally by decomposition and reassimilation.

The Phosphorus Cycle

Organisms require phosphorus as a major constituent of nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP and other energy shuttles and as a mineral constituent of bones and teeth.

In some respects, the phosphorus cycle is simpler than either the carbon or nitrogen cycle. Phosphorus cycling does not include movement through the atmosphere because there are no significant phosphorus-containing gases. In addition, phosphorus occurs in only one biologically important inorganic form, phosphate (PO43-), which plants absorb and use for organic synthesis. The weathering of rocks gradually adds phosphate to soil (FIGURE 54.19). After producers incorporate phosphorus into biological molecules, it is transferred to consumers in organic form and then added back to the soil by the excretion of phosphate by animals and by the action of bacterial and fungal decomposers on detritus.

Fig 54-19. The phosphorus cycle. Phosphorus, which does not have an atmospheric component, tends to cycle locally (yellow arrows). Generally, small losses from terrestrial systems caused by leaching are balanced by gains from the weathering of rocks. In aquatic systems, as in terrestrial systems, phosphorus is cycled through food webs. Some phosphorus is lost from the ecosystem through chemical precipitation or through settling of detritus to the bottom, where sedimentation may lock away some of the nutrient before biological processes can reclaim it. On a much longer time scale, this phosphorus may become available to ecosystems again through geologic processes such as uplifting (gold arrows).

Humus and soil particles bind phosphate, so that the recycling of phosphorus tends to be quite localized in ecosystems. However, phosphorus does leach into the water table, gradually draining from terrestrial ecosystems to the sea. Severe erosion can hasten this drain, but the weathering of rocks generally keeps pace with the loss of phosphate. Phosphate that reaches the ocean gradually accumulates in sediments and becomes incorporated into rocks that may later be included in terrestrial ecosystems as a result of geologic processes that raise the seafloor or lower sea level at a particular location. Thus, most phosphate recycles locally among soil, plants, and consumers on the scale of ecological time, while a parallel sedimentary cycle removes and restores terrestrial phosphorus over geologic time. The same general pattern applies to other nutrients that lack atmospheric forms.

FIGURE 54.20 reviews chemical cycling in ecosystems in their most general form. Note again the key role that detritivores (decomposers) play.

 Decomposition rates largely determine the rates of nutrient cycling

The rates at which nutrients cycle in different ecosystems are extremely variable, mostly as a result of differences in rates of decomposition. In tropical rain forests, most organic material decomposes in a few months to a few years, while in temperate forests, decomposition takes, on average, four to six years. In the tundra, decomposition can take 50 years, and in aquatic ecosystems, where most decomposition occurs in anaerobic bottom muds, it may occur even more slowly. The temperature and the availability of water and O2 all affect rates of decomposition and thus nutrient cycling times. Other factors that can influence nutrient cycling are local soil chemistry and the frequency of fires.

In some parts of a tropical rain forest, key nutrients such as phosphorus occur in the soil at levels far below those typical of a temperate forest. At first this might seem paradoxical because tropical forests generally have very high production. The key to this apparent riddle is rapid decomposition in tropical areas because of the warm temperatures and abundant precipitation. In addition, the immense biomass of these forests creates a high demand for nutrients, which are absorbed almost as soon as they become available through the action of decomposers. As a result of rapid decomposition, relatively little organic material accumulates as leaf litter on the floor of tropical rain forests; about 75%  of the nutrients in the ecosystem are present in the woody trunks of trees, and about 10%  are contained in the soil. Thus, the relatively low concentrations of some nutrients in the soil of tropical rain forests result from a fast cycling time, not an overall scantiness of these elements in the ecosystem.

In temperate forests, where decomposition is much slower, the soil may contain 50%  of all the organic material in the ecosystem. The nutrients present in temperate forest detritus and soil may remain there for fairly long periods of time before being assimilated by plants.

In aquatic ecosystems, bottom sediments are comparable to the detritus layer in terrestrial ecosystems, but algae and aquatic plants usually assimilate nutrients directly from the water. Thus, these sediments often constitute a nutrient sink, and aquatic ecosystems can only be very productive if there is interchange between the bottom layers of water and the surface (see FIGURE 50.16).





 Nutrient cycling is strongly regulated by vegetation

Many research groups are conducting long-term ecological research (LTER) to monitor the dynamics of natural ecosystems over long periods of time. Let's examine one example of LTER that has helped ecologists understand the key role plants play in regulating nutrient cycles.

Since 1963, a team of scientists has been conducting a long-term study of nutrient cycling in a forest ecosystem. The study site is the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It is a deciduous forest with several valleys, each drained by a small creek that is a tributary of Hubbard Brook. Bedrock impenetrable to water is close to the surface of the soil, and each valley constitutes a watershed that can drain only through its creek.

The research team first determined the mineral budget for each of six valleys by measuring the inflow and outflow of several key nutrients. They collected rainfall at several sites to measure the amount of water and dissolved minerals added to the ecosystem. To monitor the loss of water and minerals, they constructed a small concrete dam with a V-shaped spillway across the creek at the bottom of each valley (FIGURE 54.21a, p. 1214). About 60%  of the water added to the ecosystem as rainfall and snow exits through the stream, and the remaining 40%  is lost by transpiration from plants, evaporation from other organisms, and evaporation from the soil.

Fig 54-21. Nutrient cycling in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: an example of long-term ecological research. (a) Concrete dams built across streams at the bottom of watersheds enabled researchers to monitor the outflow of water and nutrients from the ecosystem. (b) Some watersheds were completely logged to study the effects of the loss of vegetation on drainage and nutrient cycling. (c) The concentration of nitrate in runoff from the deforested watershed was 60 times greater than in a control (unloged) watershed.

Preliminary studies confirmed that internal cycling within a terrestrial ecosystem conserves most of the mineral nutrients. Mineral inflow and outflow balanced and were relatively small compared with the quantity of minerals being recycled within the forest ecosystem. For example, only about 0.3%  more Ca2+ left a valley via its creek than was added by rainwater, and this small net loss was probably replaced by chemical decomposition of the bedrock. During most years, the forest actually registered small net gains of a few mineral nutrients, including nitrogenous ones.

In 1966, one of the valleys, with an area of 15.6 hectares, was completely logged and then sprayed with herbicides for three years to prevent regrowth of plants (FIGURE 54.21b). All the original plant material was left in place to decompose. The inflow and outflow of water and minerals in the experimentally altered watershed were compared with the inflow and outflow in a control watershed for three years. Water runoff from the altered watershed increased by 30-40% , apparently because there were no plants to absorb and transpire water from the soil. Net losses of minerals from the altered watershed were huge. The concentration of Ca2+ in the creek increased fourfold, for example, and the concentration of K+ increased by a factor of 15. Most remarkable was the loss of nitrate, which increased in concentration in the creek 60-fold (FIGURE 54.21c). Not only was this vital mineral nutrient drained from the ecosystem, but nitrate in the creek reached a level considered unsafe for drinking water.

This study demonstrated that the amount of nutrients leaving an intact forest ecosystem is controlled by the plants themselves; when plants are not present to retain them, nutrients are lost from the system. These effects are almost immediate, occurring within a few months of logging, and continue as long as plants are absent.

After 35 years, data from Hubbard Brook point to some other long-term trends. It now appears that none of the watersheds was undisturbed by human activity even when the study began. For instance, before and during the study, acid precipitation seems to have caused an increase in the levels of Ca2+ in stream water. Apparently, since the 1950s, acid rain and snow have dissolved most of the Ca2+ from the forest soil, and the streams have carried it away. By the 1990s, forest plants at Hubbard Brook had virtually stopped adding new growth, apparently because of a lack of Ca2+.

Although the Hubbard Brook study and several other LTER projects were designed to assess natural ecosystem dynamics, the results continue to provide important insight into the mechanisms by which human activities affect these processes. In this chapter's last section, we will examine how human intrusions in ecosystem dynamics are altering the biosphere.





 The human population is disrupting chemical cycles throughout the biosphere

Human activity often intrudes in nutrient cycles by removing nutrients from one part of the biosphere and adding them to another. This may result in the depletion of key nutrients in one area, excesses in another place, and the disruption of the natural chemical cycles in both locations. For example, nutrients in the soil of croplands soon appear in the wastes of humans and livestock. Then they appear in streams and lakes through runoff from fields and sewage discharge. Someone eating a piece of broccoli in Washington, DC, is consuming nutrients that only days before might have been in the soil in California; and a short time later, some of these nutrients will be in the Potomac River on their way to the sea, having passed through an individual's digestive system and the local sewage facilities.

Humans have intruded on nutrient cycles to such an extent that it is no longer possible to understand any cycle without taking human effects into account. In addition to transporting nutrients from one location to another, we have added entirely new materials, many of them toxic, to ecosystems. Let's examine a few specific examples of how humans are impacting the biosphere's chemical dynamics.

Agricultural Effects on Nutrient Cycling

After natural vegetation is cleared from an area, crops may be grown for some time using the existing reserve of nutrients in the soil; nutrient supplementation isn't required. However, in agricultural ecosystems, a substantial fraction of these nutrients is not recycled but is exported from the area in the form of crop biomass (FIGURE 54.22). The "free" period for crop production--when there is no need to add nutrients to the soil--varies greatly. When some of the early North American prairie lands were first tilled, for example, good crops could be produced for many years because the large store of organic materials in the soil continued to decompose and provide nutrients. By contrast, some cleared land in the tropics can be farmed for only one or two years because so few of the ecosystems' nutrients are contained in the soil (see p. 1213). Eventually, in any area under intensive agriculture, the natural store of nutrients becomes exhausted. When this happens, fertilizer must be added. The industrially synthesized fertilizers used extensively today come from oil and are produced at considerable expense of both money and energy.

Fig 54-22. Agricultural impact on soil nutrients. Transport of harvested plant biomass to market removes mineral nutrients that would otherwise be cycled back to the local soil. To replace the lost nutrients, farmers must apply fertilizers--either organic fertilizers, such as manure or mulch, or manufactured fertilizers.

Agriculture has a great impact on the nitrogen cycle. Cultivation--breaking up and mixing the soil--increases the rate of decomposition of organic matter, releasing usable nitrogen that is then removed from the ecosystem when crops are harvested. As we saw in the case of Hubbard Brook, ecosystems from which living plants are removed lose nitrogen not only because it is removed with the plants themselves, but because without plants to take them up, nitrates continue to be leached from the ecosystem. Industrially synthesized fertilizer is used to make up for the loss of usable nitrogen from agricultural ecosystems.

Recent studies indicate that human activities have approximately doubled the globe's supply of fixed nitrogen available to primary producers. The main cause is industrial nitrogen fixation for fertilizers, but increased cultivation of legumes, with their nitrogen-fixing symbionts, and burning are also important. (Fire releases nitrogen compounds stored in soil and vegetation, thereby enhancing the cycling of nitrogen compounds available to photosynthesizers.) In addition to its effects on local soil and water chemistry, the excessive supplements of fixed nitrogen are also associated with a greater release of N2 and nitrogen oxides into the air by denitrifying bacteria (see FIGURE 54.18). Nitrogen oxides can contribute to atmospheric warming, to the depletion of atmospheric ozone, and in some ecosystems to acid precipitation.

Critical Load and Nutrient Cycles

Excesses of nitrogenous minerals in the soil eventually leach into groundwater or run off directly into freshwater and marine ecosystems. Many rivers contaminated with nitrates and ammonium from agricultural runoff and sewage drain into the North Atlantic Ocean, with the highest nitrogen inputs to the ocean coming from northern Europe. Throughout the Northern Hemisphere, nitrate concentrations in rivers are rising in proportion to human population along the rivers. For example, nitrate levels in the Mississippi River have more than doubled since 1965. Groundwater concentrations of nitrate are also increasing in agricultural areas, sometimes exceeding the maximum level considered safe for drinking water (10 mg of nitrate per liter).

In certain situations, the addition of nitrogen to ecosystems by human activities can actually have positive effects, at least from the human perspective. Adding nitrogenous fertilizers can offset the nitrogen limitation of primary production that is common in terrestrial ecosystems. For example, in Swedish forests, which are nitrogen limited, agricultural runoff of nitrates and ammonia and emissions of nitrogenous compounds from factories are correlated with a 30%  boost in the growth rates of trees during the past 50 years. In other words, humans have been inadvertently fertilizing the forests.

The key issue seems to be critical load, the amount of added nitrogen that can be absorbed by plants without damaging ecosystem integrity. It is the nitrogen that exceeds critical load that turns up in groundwater and aquatic ecosystems such as lakes, a problem we examine in more detail next.

Accelerated Eutrophication of Lakes

As we discussed in Chapter 50, lakes are classified on a scale of increasing nutrient availability as oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic (see FIGURE 50.19). In an oligotrophic lake, primary productivity is relatively low because the mineral nutrients required by phytoplankton are scarce. In other lakes, basin and watershed characteristics result in the addition of more nutrients. These nutrients are captured by the primary producers and then continuously recycled through the lake's food webs. Thus, the overall productivity is higher in mesotrophic lakes and highest in eutrophic (from the Greek, meaning "well nourished") ones.

Human intrusion has disrupted freshwater ecosystems by what is termed cultural eutrophication. Sewage and factory wastes; runoff of animal waste from pastures and stockyards; and the leaching of fertilizer from agricultural, recreational, and urban areas has overloaded many streams, rivers, and lakes with inorganic nutrients. This enrichment often results in an explosive increase in the density of photosynthetic organisms (see FIGURE 54.8). Shallower areas become weed choked, making boating and fishing impossible. Large "blooms" of algae and cyanobacteria become common, sometimes resulting in increased oxygen production during the day but reduced oxygen levels at night because of respiration by these large populations of organisms. As the photosynthetic organisms die and organic material accumulates at the lake bottom, detritivores use all the oxygen in the deeper waters. All these effects may make it impossible for some organisms to survive. For example, cultural eutrophication of Lake Erie wiped out commercially important fishes such as blue pike, whitefish, and lake trout by the 1960s. Since then, tighter regulations on the dumping of wastes into the lake have enabled some fish populations to rebound, but many of the native species of fishes and invertebrates have not recovered. Government policies to ensure better water quality should be a high priority in all countries.





 Combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of acid precipitation

The burning of wood and the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels release oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that react with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid, respectively. The acids eventually fall back to Earth's surface as acid precipitation. Acid precipitation is defined as rain, snow, or fog that has a pH less than 5.6 (see FIGURE 3.9). It lowers the pH of aquatic ecosystems and affects the soil chemistry of terrestrial ecosystems.

Although acid precipitation due to fuel combustion has been occurring ever since the Industrial Revolution, emissions have increased during the past hundred years, mainly as a result of ore smelters and electrical generating plants. Ecologists first brought the environmental impact of acid precipitation to public attention in the 1960s, when they began to document damage to forests and lakes in Europe and eastern North America. It is clearly a regional or even a global problem, not a local one. To counter local pollution problems, smelters and generating plants are built with very tall exhaust stacks (over 300 m high). This reduces pollution at ground level, but exports the problem far downwind. The nitrogenous and sulfurous pollutants from fuel combustion can drift hundreds of kilometers before falling as acid precipitation. Ecologists began to realize that lakes in eastern Canada were dying because of air pollution from factories in the midwest. Lakes in southern Norway were losing fish because of acid rain from pollutants generated in Great Britain. By 1980, precipitation in large areas of Europe and North America averaged pH 4.0-4.5, with "record" storms occasionally dropping rain as acidic as pH 3.0 (FIGURE 54.23).

Fig 54-23. Distribution of acid precipitation in North America and Europe. (a) In these maps of North America and Europe with 1980 data superimposed, the numbers such as 10&#160;X&#160; identify the acidity of precipitation in those areas compared to a normal rainwater pH of 5.6. In an area marked 10&#160;X&#160;, precipitation was, on average, ten times more acidic than normal (which means the pH in those areas averaged 4.6). Other areas had precipitation 20&#160;X&#160; or 30&#160;X&#160; the normal rainfall acidity. (b) This U.S. map profiles pH averages for precipitation in 1999.

In terrestrial ecosystems, such as the deciduous forests of New England, the change in soil pH due to acid precipitation causes calcium and other nutrients to leach from the soil. The nutrient deficiencies affect the health of plants and limit their growth.

Freshwater ecosystems are particularly sensitive to acid precipitation. The lakes in North America and northern Europe that are most readily damaged by acid precipitation are those underlain by granite bedrock. Such lakes generally have relatively poor buffering capacity because the water is "soft," meaning the concentration of bicarbonate, an important buffer, is low. Fish populations have declined in thousands of such lakes in Norway and Sweden, where the pH of the water has dropped below 5.0. In Canada, newly hatched lake trout die when the pH drops below 5.4. Lake trout are keystone predators in many Canadian lakes, and when they are replaced by acid-tolerant fish such as yellow perch, the dynamics of food webs change dramatically (see FIGURE 53.14 to review keystone predators).

Environmental regulations and new industrial technologies have enabled many developed countries, including the United States, to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions during the past 30 years. In the United States, for example, sulfur dioxide emissions were reduced 25%  between 1990 and 1996. The water chemistry in the streams and freshwater lakes of New England is slowly improving after decades of severe acid precipitation. However, ecologists estimate that it will take another 10 to 20 years for these ecosystems to recover, even if sulfur dioxide emissions continue to decrease.





 Toxins can become concentrated in successive trophic levels of food webs

Humans produce an immense variety of toxic chemicals, including thousands of synthetics previously unknown in nature, that are dumped into ecosystems with little regard for the ecological consequences. Many of these poisons cannot be degraded by microorganisms and consequently persist in the environment for years or even decades. In other cases, chemicals released into the environment may be relatively harmless but are converted to more toxic products by reaction with other substances or by the metabolism of microorganisms. For example, mercury, a by-product of plastic production, was once routinely expelled into rivers and the sea in an insoluble form. Bacteria in the bottom mud converted the waste to methyl mercury, an extremely toxic soluble compound that then accumulated in the tissues of organisms, including humans who consumed fish from the contaminated waters.

Organisms acquire toxic substances from the environment along with nutrients and water. Some of the poisons are metabolized and excreted, but others accumulate in specific tissues, especially fat. An example of a class of industrially synthesized compounds that act in this manner are the chlorinated hydrocarbons, which include many pesticides, such as DDT, and the industrial chemicals called PCBs (polychlorinated biphenols). Current research is implicating many of these compounds and others in endocrine system disruption in a large number of animal species, including humans. One of the reasons these toxins are so harmful is that they become more concentrated in successive trophic levels of a food web, a process called biological magnification. Magnification occurs because the biomass at any given trophic level is produced from a much larger biomass ingested from the level below. Thus, top-level carnivores tend to be the organisms most severely affected by toxic compounds that have been released into the environment.

A well-known example of biological magnification involves DDT, which has been used to control insects such as mosquitoes and agricultural pests. In the decade after World War II, the chemical industry promoted the benefits of DDT before anybody really understood the ecological consequences (FIGURE 54.24). By the 1950s, scientists began to understand that DDT persists in the environment and is transported by water to areas far from where it is applied. But by then, the poison had already become a global problem.

Fig 54-24. We've changed our tune. In this 1947 Time magazine advertisement, a chorus line sings the praises of a pesticide that was banned in the United States 25 years later.

Because DDT is soluble in lipids, it collects in the fatty tissues of animals, and its concentration is magnified in higher trophic levels (FIGURE 54.25). Traces of DDT have been found in nearly every organism tested; it has even been found in human breast milk throughout the world. One of the first signs that DDT was a serious environmental problem was a decline in the populations of pelicans, ospreys, and eagles, birds that feed at the top of food chains. The accumulation of DDT (and DDE, a product of its partial breakdown) in the tissues of these birds interfered with the deposition of calcium in their eggshells, a trend that may have already begun because of other environmental contaminants. When these birds tried to incubate their eggs, the weight of the parents broke the shells of affected eggs, resulting in catastrophic declines in their reproduction rates. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring helped bring the problem to public attention in the 1960s (see Chapter 50), and DDT was banned in the United States in 1971. A dramatic recovery in populations of the affected bird species followed. The pesticide is still used in many other parts of the world, however.

DDT concentration in a Long Island Sound food chain was magnified by a factor of about 10 million, from just 0.000003 part per million (ppm) as a pollutant in seawater to a concentration of about 25 ppm in the fish-eating osprey, a bird at the top of this food pyramid.





 Human activities may be causing climate change by increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere

Many human activities release a variety of gaseous waste products. We once thought that the vastness of the atmosphere could absorb these materials without significant consequences, but we now know that the finite volume of the atmosphere means that human intrusions can cause fundamental changes in its composition and its interactions with the rest of the biosphere. One pressing problem is the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Rising Atmospheric CO2

Since the Industrial Revolution, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels and the burning of enormous quantities of wood removed by deforestation. Various methods of measurement have estimated that the average carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere before 1850 was about 274 parts per million (ppm). When a monitoring station on Hawaii's Mauna Loa peak began making very accurate measurements in 1958, the CO2 concentration was 316 ppm (FIGURE 54.26). Today, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeds 370 ppm, an increase of about 14%  since the measurements began. If CO2 emissions continue to increase at the present rate, by the year 2075, the atmospheric concentration of this gas will be double what it was at the start of the Industrial Revolution.

Fig 54-26. The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and average temperatures from 1958 to 2000. In addition to normal seasonal fluctuations in CO2 levels, this graph shows a steady increase in the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (black). These measurements are being taken at a relatively remote site in Hawaii, where the air is free from the variable short-term effects that occur near large urban areas. Though average temperatures over the same time period fluctuate a great deal (red), there is a warming trend. Climatologists predict that temperatures could rise about 2&#176;C over the next 100 years if atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise at the current rate.

An increased productivity by vegetation is one predictable consequence of increasing CO2 levels. In fact, when CO2 concentrations are raised in experimental chambers such as greenhouses, most plants respond with increased growth. However, because C3 plants are more limited than C4 plants by CO2 availability (see Chapter 10), one effect of increasing CO2 concentrations on a global scale may be the spread of C3 species into terrestrial habitats previously favoring C4 plants. This may have important agricultural implications. For example, corn, a C4 plant and the most important grain crop in the United States, may be replaced on farms by wheat and soybeans, C3 crops that will outproduce corn in a CO2-enriched environment. However, it is not yet possible to predict accurately the gradual and complex effects that rising CO2 levels will have on species composition in nonagricultural communities.

The Greenhouse Effect

One factor that complicates predictions about the long-term effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration is its possible influence on Earth's heat budget. Much of the solar radiation that strikes the planet is reflected back into space. Although CO2 and water vapor in the atmosphere are transparent to visible light, they intercept and absorb much of the reflected infrared radiation, re-reflecting some of it back toward Earth. This process retains some of the solar heat. If it were not for this greenhouse effect, the average air temperature at Earth's surface would be -18&#176;C, and most life as we know it could not exist. The marked increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last 150 years concerns many ecologists and environmentalists because of its potential to increase global temperature.

Global Warming

Scientists continue to construct mathematical models in attempts to predict how increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 will affect global temperatures. To date, no models are sophisticated enough to include all the biotic and abiotic factors that can influence atmospheric gas concentrations and temperature (for example, cloud cover, CO2 uptake by photosynthetic organisms, and the effects of particles in the air). However, a number of studies predict a doubling of CO2 concentration by the end of the twenty-first century and an associated average temperature increase of about 2&#176;C. Supporting these models is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperatures in prehistoric times. Climatologists can actually measure CO2 levels in bubbles trapped in glacial ice at different times in Earth's history. Prehistoric temperatures are inferred by several methods, including analysis of past vegetation based on fossils.

An increase of only 1.3&#176;C would make the world warmer than at any time in the past 100,000 years. A worst-case scenario suggests that the warming would be greatest near the poles; the resultant melting of polar ice might raise sea level by an estimated 100 m, gradually flooding coastal areas 150 km (or more) inland from the current coastline. New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and many other cities would then be under water. A warming trend would also alter the geographic distribution of precipitation, making major agricultural areas of the central United States much drier. However, the various mathematical models disagree about the details of how climate in each region will be affected. By studying how past periods of global warming and cooling affected plant communities, ecologists are trying to predict the consequences of future temperature changes. Analysis of fossilized pollen provides evidence that plant communities change dramatically with changes in temperature. Past climate changes occurred gradually, and plant and animal populations could migrate into areas where abiotic conditions allowed them to survive. A major concern is the projected high rates of climate change--by some estimates, higher than at any time in the past 10,000 years. Many organisms, especially plants that cannot disperse rapidly over long distances, will probably not be able to survive such rapid changes.

Coal, natural gas, gasoline, wood, and other organic fuels central to modern life cannot be burned without releasing CO2. The apparent warming of the planet that is now under way as a result of the addition of CO2 to the atmosphere is a problem of uncertain consequences and no simple solutions. Given the importance of combustion to our increasingly industrialized societies, stabilizing CO2 emissions will require concerted international effort and the acceptance of dramatic changes in both personal lifestyles and industrial processes. Many ecologists believe that this effort suffered a major setback in 2001, when the United States pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 pledge by the industrialized nations to reduce their CO2 output by about 5%  over a ten-year period.





 Human activities are depleting atmospheric ozone

Life on Earth is protected from the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by a protective layer of ozone molecules (O3) that is present in the lower stratosphere between 17 and 25 km above Earth's surface. Ozone absorbs UV radiation, preventing much of it from contacting organisms in the biosphere. Satellite studies of the atmosphere suggest that the ozone layer has been gradually "thinning" since 1975 (FIGURE 54.27).

This graph tracks the thickness of the ozone layer in units called Dobsons. (c) Exposure to UV radiation. Australia, home to these sun lovers, already has the world's highest rate of skin cancer. More intense UV radiation through an eroded ozone shield increases the cancer risk.

The destruction of atmospheric ozone probably results mainly from the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used for refrigeration, as propellants in aerosol cans, and in certain manufacturing processes. When the breakdown products from these chemicals rise to the stratosphere, the chlorine they contain reacts with ozone, reducing it to molecular O2. Subsequent chemical reactions liberate the chlorine, allowing it to react with other ozone molecules in a catalytic chain reaction. The effect is most apparent over Antarctica, where cold winter temperatures facilitate these atmospheric reactions. Scientists first described the "ozone hole" over Antarctica in 1985 and have since documented that it is a seasonal phenomenon that grows and shrinks in an annual cycle. However, the magnitude of ozone depletion and the size of the ozone hole have generally increased in recent years, and the hole sometimes extends as far as the southernmost portions of Australia, New Zealand, and South America. At the more heavily populated middle latitudes, ozone levels have decreased 2-10%  during the past 20 years.

The consequences of ozone depletion for life on Earth may be quite severe. Some scientists expect increases in both lethal and nonlethal forms of skin cancer and in cataracts among humans, as well as unpredictable effects on crops and natural communities, especially the phytoplankton that are responsible for a large proportion of Earth's primary production. The danger posed by ozone depletion is so great that many nations have agreed to end the production of chlorofluorocarbons within a decade. Unfortunately, even if all chlorofluorocarbons were totally banned today, chlorine molecules that are already in the atmosphere will continue to influence stratospheric ozone levels for at least a century.

The human impact on Earth's ozone shield is just one more example of how far our technological tentacles reach in disrupting the dynamics of ecosystems and the entire biosphere. How are human activities affecting Earth's biodiversity? In the last chapter of this book, we explore that question and highlight how progress in conservation biology may help slow the loss of species.

Biology is the science of life. Thus, it is fitting that our final chapter be about preserving life. Conservation biology is a goal-oriented science that seeks to counter the biodiversity crisis, the current rapid decrease in Earth's great variety of life.

To date, scientists have described and formally named about 1.5 million species of organisms. We can only estimate how many more currently exist. Some biologists believe that the number is about 10 million, but others estimate it to be between 30 million and 80 million. Some of the greatest concentrations of species are found in the tropics, where the scene in the photograph on this page is commonplace: tropical forests (such as the one in Ecuador shown here) being destroyed at an alarming rate to make room for and support a burgeoning human population.

Throughout the biosphere, human activities are altering trophic structures, energy flow, chemical cycling, and natural disturbance--ecosystem processes on which we and other species depend. The amount of human-altered land surface is approaching 50% , and we use over half of all accessible surface fresh water. In the oceans, stocks of many fishes are being depleted by overharvest, and some of the most productive and diverse areas, such as coral reefs and estuaries, are being severely stressed. By some estimates, we are in the process of doing more damage to the biosphere and pushing more species toward extinction than the large asteroid that seems to have triggered the mass extinctions at the close of the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago (seeFIGURE 25.6). Globally, the rate of species loss may be as much as 1,000 times higher than at any time in the past 100,000 years.

In this chapter, we take a closer look at the biodiversity crisis and at the science of conservation biology. We will examine some of the research and conservation strategies biologists are using in attempts to slow the rate of species loss. Along the way, we will see that conservation biology relies on research at all levels of ecology, from populations to ecosystems and landscapes.





THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS

 Biodiversity at all three levels is vital to human welfare



 

 The four major threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction, introduced species, overexploitation, and food chain disruptions



Extinction is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring almost since life first evolved; it is the current rate of extinction that underlies the biodiversity crisis. Because we can only estimate the number of species currently existing, we cannot determine the actual rate of species loss or the real magnitude of the biodiversity crisis. We do know for certain that we are experiencing a high rate of species extinction caused by an escalating rate of ecosystem degradation by a single species--Homo sapiens. Conservation biology is about trying to understand what is happening to biodiversity, why it is happening, and what we can do about it.





CONSERVATION AT THE POPULATION AND SPECIES LEVELS

 

 According to the small-population approach, a population's small size can draw it into an extinction vortex



 

 The declining-population approach is a proactive conservation strategy for detecting, diagnosing, and halting population declines



 

 Conserving species involves weighing conflicting demands



Among biologists focusing on conservation at the population and species levels, there are two main approaches, which we will call the small-population approach and the declining-population approach.





CONSERVATION AT THE COMMUNITY, ECOSYSTEM, AND LANDSCAPE LEVELS

 

 Edges and corridors can strongly influence landscape biodiversity



 

 Conservation biologists face many challenges in setting up protected areas



 

 Nature reserves must be functional parts of landscapes



 

 Restoring degraded areas is an increasingly important conservation effort



 

 The goal of sustainable development is reorienting ecological research and challenging all of us to reassess our values



 

 The future of the biosphere may depend on our biophilia



Most preservation efforts in the past have focused on saving endangered species, but today, conservation biology increasingly aims to sustain the biodiversity of entire communities and ecosystems. On a broader scale yet, the principles of community and ecosystem ecology are being brought to bear on studies of the biodiversity of whole landscapes. In an ecological sense, a landscape is a regional assemblage of interacting ecosystems, such as a forest or forest patches, adjacent open fields, wetlands, streams, and streamside (riparian) habitats.

Landscape ecology is the application of ecological principles to the study of human land-use patterns. Understanding landscape dynamics is critically important in conservation because many species use more than one kind of ecosystem, and many live on the borders between ecosystems. The goal of landscape ecology, of which ecosystem management is part, is to understand patterns of landscape use in the past, present, and foreseeable future and to make biodiversity conservation a functional part of the picture. Such a broad view requires understanding community and ecosystem ecology as well as human population dynamics and economics.





 The three levels of biodiversity are genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity

Biodiversity--short for biological diversity--has three main components, or levels (FIGURE 55.1).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 55-1. Three levels of biodiversity. (The oversized chromosomes in the voles symbolize the genetic variation within the population.)

Loss of Genetic Diversity

The first level of biodiversity is genetic variation. In addition to the individual variation within a population, there is also genetic variation between populations, associated with adaptations to local conditions (see Chapter 23). If one local population becomes extinct, then a species has lost some of the genetic diversity that makes adaptation possible. This erosion of genetic diversity is, of course, detrimental to the overall adaptive prospects of the species. But the loss of genetic diversity throughout the biosphere also has implications for human welfare. For example, wild populations of plants closely related to our agricultural species are genetic resources for improving certain crop qualities through plant breeding.

Loss of Species Diversity

The second level of biodiversity is the variety of species in an ecosystem or throughout the entire biosphere--what we called species richness in Chapter 53. Much of the popular and political discussion of the biodiversity crisis centers on species. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines an endangered species as one that is "in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range." Also defined for protection by the ESA, threatened species are those that are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of their range.

Here are just a few examples of why conservation biologists are so concerned about species loss:

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), 13%  of the 9,040 known bird species in the world are threatened with extinction. That's 1,183 species! In the past 40 years, population densities of migratory songbirds in the mid-Atlantic United States dropped 50% .

A recent survey conducted by the Center for Plant Conservation showed that of the approximately 20,000 known plant species in the United States, 200 species have become extinct since such records have been kept. Another 730 plant species in the United States are endangered or threatened with extinction.

About 20%  of the known freshwater fishes in the world have either become extinct during historical times or are seriously threatened. One of the largest rapid extinction events yet recorded is the ongoing loss of freshwater fishes in Lake Victoria in East Africa. About 200 of the 300 species of cichlids in the lake have been lost, mainly as a result of the recent introduction by Europeans of an exotic predator, the Nile perch.

Since 1900, 123 freshwater vertebrate and invertebrate species have become extinct in North America, and hundreds more species are threatened. Extinction rates for North American freshwater fauna are about five times higher than those for terrestrial animals. About 4%  of the known freshwater species will become extinct each decade unless habitat loss and degradation are reversed.

Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson has compiled what he grimly calls the Hundred Heartbeat Club. The species that belong are those animals that number fewer than 100 individuals and so are only that many heartbeats away from extinction (FIGURE 55.2).



Click image to enlarge



Fig 55-2. A hundred heartbeats from extinction. These are just three of the many members of what E. O. Wilson calls the Hundred Heartbeat Club, species with fewer than 100 individuals remaining on Earth.

Several researchers estimate that at the current rate of destruction, over half of all plant and animal species will be gone by the end of this new century.

Extinction of species may be local; for example, a species may be lost in one river system but survive in an adjacent one. Global extinction of a species means that it is lost from all its locales. Extinction is often an unseen process. To know for certain that a given species is extinct, we must know its exact distribution. But millions of the world's species have not even been identified. Arthropods (especially insects), nematodes, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes head the list of taxa with great numbers of undiscovered species. But even well-studied taxa, such as birds and mammals, are not completely known. In the past decade, scientists have increased the list of known mammals by about 15% . Without a more complete catalog of species diversity and knowledge of the geographic distribution and ecological roles of Earth's species, our efforts to understand the structure and function of ecosystems on which our survival depends will remain incomplete.

Loss of Ecosystem Diversity

The variety of the biosphere's ecosystems is the third level of biological diversity. Within each ecosystem, the biological community has a network of interactions among populations of different species. The local extinction of one species--say, a keystone predator--can have a negative impact on the overall species richness of the community (see FIGURE 53.14). More broadly, each ecosystem can have an important impact on the whole biosphere. Be it a rain forest, peat bog, or expanse of open ocean, an ecosystem has characteristic patterns of energy flow and chemical cycling. For example, the productive "pastures" of phytoplankton in the oceans may help moderate the greenhouse effect by consuming massive quantities of CO2 for photosynthesis and for building shells made of bicarbonate.

Some ecosystems are being erased from Earth at an astonishing pace. For example, the cumulative area of all tropical rain forests on the planet is about the size of the 48 contiguous United States, and we lose an area equal to the state of West Virginia each year.

The biodiversity crisis is most often equated to species extinctions, but conservation biologists now realize that the disappearance of a species is often the result of losses in diversity at other levels, including the loss of genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity.





 Biodiversity at all three levels is vital to human welfare

Why should we care about the loss of biodiversity? Perhaps the purest reason is what E. O. Wilson calls biophilia, our sense of connection to nature and other forms of life. The concept that other species are important and should be protected is a pervasive theme of many religions and the basis of the moral argument that we should protect biodiversity. There is also a concern for future human generations. Do we have the right to deprive them of Earth's species richness? Paraphrasing an old Chinese proverb, G. H. Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway, put it this way: "We must consider our planet to be on loan from our children, rather than being a gift from our ancestors."

Benefits of Species Diversity and Genetic Diversity

In addition to the aesthetic and ethical reasons for preserving biodiversity, there are practical reasons as well. Biodiversity is a crucial natural resource, and species that are threatened could provide crops, fibers, and medicines for human use. In the United States, 25%  of all prescriptions dispensed from pharmacies contain substances derived from plants. For example, in the 1970s, researchers discovered that the rosy periwinkle from Madagascar contains alkaloids that inhibit cancer cell growth (FIGURE 55.3). The result of this discovery is remission for most victims of two potentially deadly forms of cancer, Hodgkin's disease and a childhood leukemia. There are five other species of periwinkles on Madagascar, and one is approaching extinction.

Fig 55-3. The rosy periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus): a plant that saves lives. Before alkaloids that inhibit cancer cell growth were discovered in the rosy periwinkle over 20 years ago, Hodgkin's disease and acute lymphocytic leukemia were two of the deadliest cancers. Now most victims are cured. This plant is one of hundreds used to treat human diseases.

The loss of species also means the loss of genes. Each species has certain unique genes, and biodiversity represents the sum of all the genomes of all organisms on Earth. Because many millions of species may become extinct before we even know about them, we stand to lose irretrievably the valuable genetic potential held in their unique libraries of genes.

Recently, U.S. National Park Service officials have been negotiating with private industry to sell samples of extremophilic prokaryotes from the numerous hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. The corporations anticipate using DNA extracted from the prokaryotes to mass-produce commercially useful enzymes. Consider the historical example of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the gene-cloning technology based on an enzyme extracted from thermophilic prokaryotes from hot springs (see FIGURE 20.7). Many researchers and industry officials are enthusiastic about the potential that such "bioprospecting" holds for the future development of new medicines, foods, petroleum substitutes, industrial chemicals, and other important products.

Ecosystem Services

The benefits that individual species provide to humans are often substantial, but saving individual species is only part of the rationale for saving ecosystems. Humans evolved in Earth's ecosystems, and our bodies are finely adjusted to these systems. While it is possible to survive in a world with considerably less biodiversity, it is important to realize that humans are dependent on ecosystems and on interactions with other species. By allowing the extinction of species and the degradation of habitats to continue, we risk our own species' survival.

In the urban and suburban settings in which most of us live today, it is easy to lose sight of the vital ecosystem services on which we depend. Ecosystem services encompass all the processes through which natural ecosystems and the species they contain help sustain human life on Earth. Here are just a few of these ecosystem services:

Purification of air and water

Reduction of the severity of droughts and floods

Generation and preservation of fertile soils

Detoxification and decomposition of wastes

Pollination of crops and natural vegetation

Dispersal of seeds

Nutrient cycling

Control of many agricultural pests by natural enemies

Protection of coastal shores from erosion

Protection from ultraviolet rays

Moderation of weather extremes

Provision of aesthetic beauty

Human life would cease without these ecosystem services; and yet we generally undervalue them, perhaps because we don't attach a monetary value to them.

In a 1997 article, ecologist Robert Costanza and colleagues attempted to put a dollar figure on ecosystem services. Their bottom-line estimate was $33 trillion per year, nearly twice as much as the gross national product of all the countries of the globe ($18 trillion). It is, of course, difficult to speculate about the dollar value of ecosystem services. Perhaps it is more realistic to do the accounting on a small scale. What, for example, is the true price of building a dam or clear-cutting a patch of forest if we include the dollar loss of ecosystem services in the cost column?

One large-scale experiment illustrates how little we understand about ecosystem services. Biosphere II, in Oracle, Arizona, was an attempt to create a closed ecosystem covering 1.27 ha (3.1 acres). Benefactors curious about the outcome invested over $200 million to build the giant airtight terrarium (FIGURE 55.4). Biosphere II had a forest with soil, a miniature ocean, and several other "ecosystems." In 1991, with much fanfare, eight people entered Biosphere II for what was supposed to be two years of isolated habitation. But the artificial biosphere failed, and the experiment had to be stopped after 15 months. Oxygen concentration dropped to 65%  of Earth's atmospheric O2 concentration, and CO2 concentration fluctuated wildly. Most of the vertebrate species became extinct in Biosphere II, and all of the pollinators died. There were population explosions of cockroaches and other pests. But in a sense, the experiment was not a failure, for it taught us that no one yet knows how to engineer a system that can provide humans with all the life-support services that natural ecosystems produce for free.

Fig 55-4. What scientists learned about ecosystem services from the world's largest terrarium. Biosphere II, in Arizona, covers an area the size of two football fields. The eight biospherians who entered the container in 1991 all had to abandon Biosphere II within 15 months. An investment of over $200 million was not enough to create a system that provides all the ecosystem services required to sustain human life. In fact, a greater appreciation for the pricelessness and complexity of ecosystem services and the biodiversity that provides them was perhaps the most important lesson from Biosphere II.





 The four major threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction, introduced species, overexploitation, and food chain disruptions

Habitat Destruction

Human alteration of habitat is the single greatest threat to biodiversity throughout the biosphere. Massive destruction of habitats throughout the world has been brought about by agriculture, urban development, forestry, mining, and environmental pollution. The IUCN (see p. 1225) implicates destruction of physical habitat in 73%  of the species designated extinct, endangered, vulnerable, or rare.

Though most studies have focused on terrestrial ecosystems, habitat loss also appears to be a major threat to marine biodiversity, especially on continental coasts and coral reefs. About 93%  of Earth's coral reefs, among the most species-rich aquatic communities, have been damaged by human activities. At the current rate of destruction, 40-50%  of the reefs could be lost in the next 30 to 40 years. About a third of the planet's marine fish species utilize coral reefs, which occupy only about 0.2%  of the ocean floor.

In addition to habitat destruction over large regions, many natural landscapes have been fragmented, broken up into small patches (FIGURE 55.5). FIGURE 55.6 illustrates how forest areas in southern Wisconsin were fragmented over a 119-year period. Forest fragmentation is also occurring at a rapid rate in tropical forests. For example, tropical rain forest losses around Veracruz, Mexico, exceeded 85%  during the 20-year span from 1967 to 1987. Deforestation continued to proceed up from the lowlands, and by 2000, only 8%  of the original forest remained, in the form of an archipelago of small forest islands. Deforestation in this area is due mostly to clearing for cattle ranches. The human population of this region has more than doubled in the last 25 years.

Fig 55-6. The history of habitat reduction and fragmentation in a Wisconsin forest. Between 1831 and 1950, more than 95%  of the original forest (green) in Cadiz Township was lost, and the remaining 5%  consisted of small fragments.

In almost all cases, habitat fragmentation leads to species loss. The prairies of North America are a good example. Prairie covered about 800,000 ha of southern Wisconsin when Europeans first arrived, but now occupies less than 0.1%  of its original area. Plant diversity surveys of 54 Wisconsin prairie remnants were conducted in 1948-1954 and then repeated in 1987-1988. During the few decades between surveys, the prairie fragments lost between 8%  and 60%  of their plant species, depending on the fragment.

Introduced Species

Ranking second behind habitat loss as a cause of the biodiversity crisis, introduced species have probably contributed to about 40%  of the extinctions recorded since 1750. Sometimes called exotic species, introduced species are those that humans move from the species' native locations to new geographic regions. (We discussed zebra mussels and Africanized bees in the United States in FIGURES 50.7 and 50.8.) In some cases, the introductions are intentional. For example, European red foxes were intentionally introduced to Australia in the late 1800s because of an interest in fox hunting. By preying on medium-sized native mammals, foxes have contributed to several of these mammals' becoming extinct. Another example, mentioned earlier, was the disastrous 1960s introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria (FIGURE 55.7a, p. 1230). In other cases, humans transplant species accidentally. For instance, the brown tree snake was accidentally introduced to Guam as a "stowaway" in military cargo after World War II (FIGURE 55.7b). Since then, 12 species of birds and 6 lizard species on which the snakes prey have become extinct on Guam. All 18 of these species continue to live on Guam's small offshore islands, which the snake has not colonized. Intentional or not, introduced species that gain a foothold usually disrupt their adopted community, often by preying on native organisms or outcompeting native species for resources.

(a) One of the largest freshwater fishes (up to 2 m long and weighing up to 450 kg), the Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria in East Africa to provide high-protein food for the growing human population. Unfortunately, the perch's main effect has been to wipe out about 200 smaller native species, reducing its own food supply to a critical level. (b) The brown tree snake, accidentally introduced to Guam at the end of World War II, has probably eliminated 18 species of birds and lizards in its new home. (c) Kudzu has invaded much of the U.S. South. (d) European starlings have displaced many native songbirds in North America. (e) Argentine ants are seen here ganging up on a red ant native to California. (f) In this underwater photo of a California lagoon, you can see an aquarium-bred, hyper-vigorous variety of the seaweed Caulerpa (in foreground) crowding out the native eelgrass.

Humans have also introduced many species with the best of intentions. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture encouraged the import of a Japanese plant called kudzu to the American South in the 1930s to help control erosion, especially along irrigation canals. At first, the government paid farmers to plant kudzu vines. The enthusiasm for the new vines led to kudzu festivals in southern towns, complete with the crowning of kudzu queens. But kudzu celebrations ended decades ago as the invasive plant took over vast expanses of the southern landscape (FIGURE 55.7c). Another introduced plant called purple loosestrife is claiming over 200,000 acres of wetlands per year, crowding out native plants and the animals that feed on the native flora. The story is similar for the introduction to the United States of a bird called the European starling (FIGURE 55.7d). A citizens group intent on introducing all plants and animals mentioned in Shakespeare's plays imported 120 starlings to New York's Central Park in 1890 (the starling is mentioned in just one line of Shakespeare's Henry IV). From that foothold, starlings spread rapidly across North America. In less than a century, the population increased to about 100 million, displacing many of the native songbird species in the United States and Canada.

The ease of travel by ships and airplanes has accelerated the transplant of species, especially unintentional introductions. For example, fire ants, which can inflict very painful beelike stings, reached the southeastern United States in the early 1900s from South America, probably in the hold of a produce ship. Fire ants have been extending their range northward and westward ever since. In Texas, for example, fire ants have apparently managed to eliminate about two-thirds of the native ant species. And another accidentally introduced ant species, the Argentine ant, is decimating populations of native ants in California (FIGURE 55.7e).

An even more recent example of introduced species is the appearance in 2000 of an alga called Caulerpa in a California lagoon (FIGURE 55.7f). The small seaweed was probably introduced by someone dumping a home saltwater aquarium. Native to Caribbean waters, the California invader is a variety of the alga that has been domesticated and selectively bred as an aquarium alga for its vigor and resistance to disease and herbivores. An earlier invasion of the Mediterranean Sea by this super seaweed is displacing many of the native algae there, and the same thing could happen now all along the Pacific coast of North America.

Introduced species are, of course, an international problem. But in the United States alone, there are at least 50,000 introduced species, with a cost to the economy of over $130 billion in damage and control efforts. And that does not include the priceless loss of native species.

Overexploitation

Overexploitation refers generally to the human harvesting of wild plants or animals at rates exceeding the ability of populations of those species to rebound. It is possible for overexploitation to endanger certain plant species, such as rare trees that produce valuable wood or some other commercial product. But overexploitation more often refers to the overhunting and overfishing of animals. Especially susceptible to overexploitation are large species with low intrinsic reproductive rates, such as elephants, whales, rhinoceroses, and other animals considered valuable by humans. Species on small islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction due to overexploitation. For example, by the 1840s, humans had overhunted the great auk, a large, flightless seabird, to extinction on islands in the Atlantic Ocean because of a demand for feathers, eggs, and meat (FIGURE 55.8).

Fig 55-8. The great auk (Pinguinis impennis). Endemic to islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, the great auk was hunted to extinction by 1844.

The decline of the African elephant, the largest extant terrestrial animal, is a classic example of the impact of overhunting. African elephants take 10 to 11 years to reach sexual maturity, and then a fertile female has a single calf every 3 to 9 years. The potential rate of population increase is only about 6%  per year, a low growth rate. Elephant populations have been declining in most of Africa during the last 50 years. Only in South Africa have elephant populations been stable or increasing. Illegal hunting for ivory is the major cause of this collapse of elephant populations. When the price of ivory increased during the 1970s, the amount of poaching for ivory grew dramatically. Currently, there is a ban on ivory trade, but this is having little impact in central and eastern Africa, where poaching is rampant.

Overfishing has dramatically reduced the population sizes of many commercially important fish species. Just over a century ago, British biologist T. H. Huxley declared, "Probably all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible: that is to say that nothing we do seriously affects the number of fish." Huxley and his contemporaries grossly underestimated an increasing demand for protein by an exploding human population coupled with overexploitation made possible by new harvesting technologies, such as long-line fishing and modern trawlers. Many populations of fishes that humans consume have now been reduced to levels that cannot sustain further exploitation. The fate of the North Atlantic bluefin tuna is just one example. Until the past few decades, this big tuna was considered a sport fish of little commercial value--just a few cents per pound for cat food. Then, beginning in the 1980s, wholesalers began airfreighting fresh, iced bluefin to Japan for sushi and sashimi. In that market, the fish now brings up to $100 per pound (FIGURE 55.9). With that kind of demand, the results are predictable. It took just ten years to reduce the North American bluefin population to less than 20%  of its 1980 size. The collapse of the northern cod fishery off Newfoundland in the 1990s is a recent example of how it is even possible to overharvest what had been a very common species.

Disruption of Food Chains

Like falling dominoes, the extinction of one species can doom its predators. But this is likely only if the predator feeds exclusively on one species, which is a rare trophic arrangement. Certainly, host-specific parasites can become extinct if their host becomes extinct. But such extinctions have not been the subject of much research.

Most of the evidence for secondary extinctions of larger organisms due to loss of prey is circumstantial. For example, the forest eagle of New Zealand, which preyed on large ground birds, became extinct around 1400 following the extinction of flightless birds called moas. After humans reached New Zealand around A.D. 1000, they probably hunted all 11 species of the large, tame moas to extinction. Although it is a reasonable hypothesis that the disappearance of the forest eagle was related to the loss of its main prey, we cannot be sure of a cause-and-effect relationship. Similarly, the decline of the black-footed ferret on the Great Plains of North America paralleled the decline of its main prey, prairie dogs. But other factors may have contributed to the decrease in ferret populations. Because most predators are not so specialized in the prey they'll eat, food chain disruption is probably less important as a cause of extinction than habitat destruction, introduced species, and overexploitation.

Now that we have an overview of the biodiversity crisis and its causes, let's examine how conservation biologists hope to apply basic principles of evolutionary biology and ecology to slow the loss of biodiversity at its various levels.





 According to the small-population approach, a population's small size can draw it into an extinction vortex

A species is designated as endangered when its populations are very small. Conservation biologists who adopt the small-population approach study the processes that can cause very small populations to finally become extinct. In other words, it is a population's smallness itself that finally drives it to extinction after such factors as habitat loss have taken their toll on population size. At the center of this concept is the extinction vortex, a downward spiral unique to small populations. A small population is prone to positive feedback loops of inbreeding and genetic drift that draw the population down the vortex toward smaller and smaller population size until no individuals exist (FIGURE 55.10).

Fig 55-10. The extinction vortex of the small-population approach. Small populations can fall into a vortex of positive feedback loops leading to smaller and smaller population size.

The key factor driving the extinction vortex is the loss of the genetic variation on which a population depends for adaptive evolution. Both inbreeding and genetic drift can cause a loss of genetic variation, and both of these processes intensify as a population shrinks (see Chapter 23 to review how genetic drift reduces genetic variation in a population).

Not all populations are doomed by low genetic diversity. A number of plant species, such as the lousewort Pedicularis and several grasses, seem to have inherently low genetic variability. Furthermore, low genetic variability does not necessarily lead to permanently small populations. For example, overhunting of northern elephant seals in the 1890s reduced the species to only 20 individuals--clearly a bottleneck with reduced genetic variation. Since that time, however, the northern seal populations have rebounded to about 150,000 individuals today. Genetic variation in these populations remains relatively low. Among plants, many populations of cord grass (Spartina anglica), which thrives in saltmarshes, are genetically uniform at many loci. S. anglica arose from a few parent plants only about a century ago by hybridization and allopolyploidy (see FIGURE 24.15). Having spread by cloning, this species now dominates large areas of tidal mudflats in Europe and Asia. Thus, in some cases, low genetic diversity is associated with population expansion rather than decline. But these cases may stand out precisely because they are so unusual. Thus, conservation biologists have good reason to be concerned about very small populations with low genetic variation.

How Small Is Too Small for a Population?

How small does a population have to be before it starts down the extinction vortex? The answer depends on the type of organism and several other factors and must be evaluated case by case. For example, large predators that feed high on the food chain usually require very large individual ranges, resulting in very low population densities. Thus, not all rare species concern conservation biologists. But whatever the number, most populations presumably require some minimum size to remain viable.

Minimum Viable Population Size (MVP). At some minimal population size, rare species will be able to sustain their numbers and survive. That number is the minimum viable population size (MVP). For a given species, MVP is usually estimated using computer models that integrate many factors. For example, the calculation may include an estimate for how many individuals in a small population are likely to be killed by some natural catastrophe such as fire or flood. Once in the extinction vortex, two or three bad weather years in a row could finish off a population that is already below MVP.

Conservation biologists factor a population's MVP into what is called the population viability analysis (PVA). The objective of the analysis is to make a reasonable prediction of a population's chances for survival, usually expressed as a certain probability of survival (for example, a 99%  chance of survival) over a particular time (for instance, 100 years).

Effective Population Size (Ne). Genetic variation is the key issue in the small-population approach. The total size of a population may be misleading because only certain members of the population breed successfully and pass their genetic alleles on to offspring. Therefore, a meaningful estimate of MVP requires the researcher to determine the effective population size, which is based on the breeding potential of the population. The following formula incorporates the sex ratio of breeding individuals into the estimate of effective population size, abbreviated Ne:  where Nf and Nm are, respectively, the numbers of females and males that successfully breed. Applying this formula to an idealized population whose total size is 1,000 individuals, Ne will also be 1,000 if every individual breeds and the sex ratio is 500 females to 500 males. In this case, Ne = (4 &#160;X&#160; 500 &#160;X&#160; 500)/(500 + 500) = 1,000. Deviation from these conditions (not all individuals breed and/or there is not a 50:50 sex ratio) reduces Ne. For instance, if the total population size is 1,000 but only 400 females breed with 400 males, then Ne = (4 &#160;X&#160; 400 &#160;X&#160; 400)/(400 + 400) = 800, or 80%  of the total population size.

In actual study populations, Ne is always some fraction of the total population. Thus, simply censusing a small population--determining the total number of individuals--does not provide a good measure of whether the population is large enough to avoid extinction. Whenever possible, conservation programs are geared to sustain total population sizes that include, at least, the minimum viable number of reproductively active individuals. Numerous life history traits can influence Ne, and alternate formulas for estimating Ne take into account family size, maturation age, genetic relatedness among population members, the effects of gene flow between geographically separated populations, and population fluctuations.

Remember that the conservation goal of sustaining effective population size (Ne) above minimum viable population size (MVP) stems from the concern that populations retain enough genetic diversity to be evolutionarily adaptable. Populations with low Ne are prone to inbreeding, reduced heterozygosity, and the random effects of genetic drift and bottlenecking (see Chapter 23). The basic premise of the small-population approach will seem less abstract in light of three case studies.

Case Study: The Greater Prairie Chicken and the Extinction Vortex

When Europeans arrived in North America, the greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) was common from New England to Virginia and all across the western prairies of the United States and Canada. Agriculture later fragmented the populations of the greater prairie chicken in the central and western states and provinces. For example, in Illinois alone, greater prairie chickens numbered in the millions in the 19th century but declined to 25,000 birds by 1933. And by 1993, the Illinois population of prairie chickens was down to only 50, though large populations remained in Kansas, Minnesota, and Nebraska.

Researchers found that the decline in the Illinois prairie chicken population was associated with a decrease in the hatching rate of eggs. Was this due to low levels of genetic diversity? By comparing DNA samples from the endangered Illinois population with DNA extracted from feathers in museum specimens collected earlier, the biologists confirmed that genetic variation had indeed declined in their study population in Jasper County, Illinois. As a further test of the extinction vortex hypothesis, the scientists imported genetic variation by transplanting birds from the larger populations in Kansas, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Over a five-year period ending in 1997, the researchers moved over 270 greater prairie chickens into their study site in Jasper County (FIGURE 55.11). The viability of eggs rapidly improved, and the population rebounded. The researchers concluded that the Jasper County population of prairie chickens was on its way down the extinction vortex until rescued by a transfusion of genetic variation from other populations.

In 1992, researchers began experimental translocations (blue arrow) of prairie chickens from Minnesota, Kansas, and Nebraska in an attempt to increase genetic variability. The population rebounded strongly.

Case Study: Population Viability Analysis for Two Popular Herbs

For his doctoral dissertation in environmental sciences in 1994 at the University of Quebec, Patrick Nantel presented a population viability analysis of two edible herbaceous plants, American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and wild leek (Allium tricoccum). These perennial herbs are found in deciduous forest communities in eastern North America (FIGURE 55.12), and both plants are at risk of extinction. The key factors in their decline are destruction and fragmentation of habitat and overharvesting by people who collect the herbs for food. Extinction has already claimed some populations of the two plants. Nantel's PVA for surviving populations in southeastern Canada incorporated data on trends in the numbers of individuals capable of reproducing in two-, three-, and four-year periods. Computer simulations projected the likely effect of environmental influences on these populations. Minimum viable population sizes generated by these computer models were about 170 ginseng plants and between 300 and 1,030 leek plants. There are only about 20 known ginseng populations in Canada having more than 170 individuals, and leek populations of more than a few hundred are rare. Thus, most populations of American ginseng and wild leek in Canada are currently too small to persist unless completely protected from harvesting by humans. Nantel's work is an example of the increasing use of predictive models in planning conservation strategy.

Case Study: Analysis of Grizzly Bear Populations

Mark Shaffer, currently with the Wilderness Society, performed one of the first population viability analyses as part of a long-term study of grizzly bears (Ursus artos) in Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas (FIGURE 55.13). Grizzly bears require very large areas of habitat. For instance, estimates of the grizzly's minimum habitat needs in western Canada are about 5 million ha for a population of 50 individuals and about 200 million ha for 1,000 individuals. A threatened species in the United States, the grizzly is currently found in only 4 of the 48 contiguous states. Its populations in those states have been drastically reduced and fragmented: In 1800, an estimated 100,000 grizzlies ranged over about 500 million ha of more or less continuous habitat, while today there are six virtually isolated populations totaling about 1,000 individuals with a total range of less than 5 million ha. The Yellowstone population is the largest, with about 200 bears in an area of about 1 million ha.

Fig 55-13. Long-term monitoring of a grizzly bear population. The ecologist is fitting this tranquilized bear with a radiotransmitter so that its movements can be tracked and compared with other individuals in the Yellowstone National Park population.

Attempting to determine viable sizes for the U.S. grizzly populations, Shaffer used life history data obtained for individual Yellowstone bears over a 12-year period and simulated the effects of environmental factors on survival and reproduction. His models predicted that a total grizzly bear population of 70 to 90 individuals in suitable habitat will have about a 95%  chance of surviving for 100 years. Achieving a 99%  chance of survival for a century or a 95%  chance for 200 years requires enough habitat to support at least 100 bears. Because of habitat limitations, however, recovery targets--the specific goals mandated by the Endangered Species Act--for several of the U.S. populations have been tentatively set at fewer than 100 bears. In such cases, biologists are hopeful that the small populations can be sustained by careful monitoring and special protective measures.

Concerned that policy decisions have been made without information on potential losses of genetic variability in grizzly bear populations, Fred Allendorf and his co-workers at the University of Montana developed a computer model that augmented Shaffer's work. Using detailed life history and kinship data from individual bears for populations in Montana, Wyoming, and British Columbia, Allendorf's model estimated that the effective population size (Ne) of grizzly populations is only about 25%  of the total population size. Usually, only a few dominant males breed, and locating females may be difficult, since individuals inhabit such extensive areas. Moreover, females may reproduce only when there is abundant food. Thus, even the relatively large Yellowstone population of 200 bears has an effective population size of only 50, a level that might lead to a loss of genetic variability and possibly fitness. Effective population size could be increased if there was migration between isolated populations of grizzlies. Computer models predict that introducing only two unrelated bears each decade into populations of 100 individuals would reduce the loss of genetic variation by about half. For the grizzly bear, and probably for many other species whose populations are very small, finding ways to promote dispersal among populations may be one of the most urgent conservation needs.

The three case studies we have examined bridge small-population theory to practical applications in conservation. Next, we look at an alternative approach to understanding the biology of extinction.





 The declining-population approach is a proactive conservation strategy for detecting, diagnosing, and halting population declines

We saw that the small-population approach emphasizes minimum viable population size and the extinction vortex as ways to understand the extinction process. There are, of course, interventions based on small-population theory, including introducing genetic variation from one population to another. But the declining-population approach is even more action oriented, focusing on threatened and endangered populations even if they are far greater than minimum viable size. To conservation biologists who lean toward this approach, a downward trend in a species may be cause for alarm and, when possible, corrective action.

The distinction between a declining population (which may be small) and a small population (which may be declining) is less important than the different priorities of the two basic conservation approaches. Practitioners of both the small-population and declining-population approaches recognize that most modern extinctions are due to the human factors of habitat destruction, introduced species, and overexploitation. But the small-population approach emphasizes smallness itself as an ultimate cause of a population's extinction, especially through loss of genetic diversity. In contrast, the declining-population approach emphasizes the environmental factors that caused a population decline in the first place. If, for example, an area is deforested, then species that depend on trees will decline and become locally extinct, whether or not they retain genetic variation.

The declining-population approach requires that population declines be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with researchers carefully dissecting the causes of a decline before recommending or trying corrective measures. If, for example, the biological magnification of a particular toxic pollutant is causing a decline in some top-level consumer such as a predatory bird, then only reduction or elimination of the poison in the environment can save that particular species. Rarely is the situation so straightforward, but there are procedures to help with even complex cases.

Steps in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Declining Populations

Like all scientific processes, analyses in conservation biology rarely follow exact formulas for investigation, but we can identify a series of logical steps that are common in the declining-population approach:

Confirm that the species is presently in decline or that it was formerly more widely distributed or more abundant. This step requires assessment of population trends and distribution.

Study the species' natural history to determine its environmental requirements. Existing research literature on the natural history of this or related species may help with this step.

Determine all the possible causes of the decline. In listing all possible hypotheses for the decline, human activities that could contribute to losses may become evident, but hypotheses cannot be restricted to human causes. For example, a series of unusually harsh winters could cause local declines in populations of certain species.

List the predictions of each hypothesis for the decline. Ideally, the investigation would emphasize contrasting predictions based on the different hypotheses (see Chapter 1).

Test the most likely hypothesis first, designing an experiment to determine if this factor is the main cause of the decline. Many factors may be correlated with the decline without being the direct cause. In the ideal experiment, researchers remove the suspected agent of decline to see if the experimental population rebounds relative to a control population. It may turn out that there are multiple causes of decline.

Apply the results of this diagnosis to the management of the threatened species. This requires monitoring recovery until the problem of decline is resolved.

As with our discussion of the small-population approach, the declining-population approach will seem less abstract in the context of a case study.

Case Study: Diagnosing and Treating the Decline of the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker

To practice conservation biology, we must understand the often subtle habitat requirements of an endangered species. The red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is an endangered, endemic species (found nowhere else) originally found throughout the southeastern United States. This species requires mature pine forests, preferably ones dominated by the longleaf pine. Such habitats have been destroyed or fragmented by logging and agriculture. Most woodpeckers nest in dead trees, but the red-cockaded woodpecker drills its nest holes in mature, living pine trees (FIGURE 55.14a). The heartwood (deep wood) of mature longleaf pines is usually rotted and softened by fungi, allowing the woodpeckers adequate space for nesting once they excavate into the heartwood. Red-cockaded woodpeckers also drill small holes around the entrance to their nest cavity, which causes resin from the tree to ooze down the trunk. The resin seems to repel certain predators, such as corn snakes, that eat bird eggs and nestlings.

Fig 55-14. Habitat requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker. (a) A red-cockaded woodpecker at the entrance to its nest site in a longleaf pine tree (b) Forest that can sustain red-cockaded woodpeckers has low undergrowth (c) Forest that cannot sustain red-cockaded woodpeckers has high, dense undergrowth that impacts the woodpeckers' access to feeding grounds

Another critical habitat factor for this woodpecker is that the understory of plants around the pine trunks must be of low profile (FIGURE 55.14b). Breeding birds tend to abandon nests when vegetation among the pines is thick and higher than about 15 feet (FIGURE 55.14c). Apparently, the birds require a clear flight path between their home trees and the neighboring feeding grounds. Historically, periodic fires swept through longleaf pine forests, keeping the undergrowth low.

The recent recovery of the red-cockaded woodpecker from near extinction to sustainable populations was achieved by recognizing the key habitat factors and protecting some longleaf pine forests that support viable numbers of the birds. The use of controlled fires to reduce forest undergrowth helps maintain mature pine trees as well as the woodpeckers.

Designing a recovery program for the red-cockaded woodpecker was complicated by the social organization of this species. These birds live in groups of a breeding pair and up to four helpers, mostly males. Helpers do not breed but assist in incubating eggs and feeding nestlings. Some young birds disperse to new territories, but most remain behind as helpers to breeders. They may eventually attain breeding status when older birds die, but the wait may take years, and even then, helpers must compete to fill breeding vacancies. Young birds that disperse as members of new groups also have a tough path to reproductive success. New groups usually occupy abandoned territories or start at a new site and must excavate the cavities needed for nesting. This nest building can take several years. Individuals generally have a better chance of reproducing by remaining behind and competing when breeding vacancies open than by dispersing and excavating homes in new territories. Perhaps this behavioral feature contributed to the decline of the red-cockaded woodpecker.

Ecologists tested the hypothesis that behavior constrains the ability of red-cockaded woodpecker populations to rebound by constructing cavities in pine trees at 20 sites in North Carolina. The results were dramatic: 18 of the 20 sites were colonized by red-cockaded woodpeckers, and new breeding groups formed only in areas where artificial cavities were drilled. The experiment supported the hypothesis that this woodpecker species was leaving much suitable habitat unoccupied because of an absence of breeding cavities. And the research informed a management strategy for reversing the decline of the red-cockaded woodpecker. A combination of controlled burning to clear understory vegetation and excavation of breeding cavities in unoccupied areas that provide good habitat has enabled a once endangered species to rebound. This example of the declining-population approach to conservation biology illustrates the need for case-by-case investigation of the factors contributing to a species' decline.





 Conserving species involves weighing conflicting demands

Determining population numbers and habitat needs is only part of the effort to save species. It is also necessary to weigh a species' biological and ecological needs against other conflicting demands. Conservation biology often highlights the relationship between science, technology, and society--one of the themes of this book. For example, an ongoing, sometimes bitter debate in the U.S. Pacific Northwest pits saving habitat for populations of the northern spotted owl, timber wolf, grizzly bear, and bull trout against demands for jobs in the timber, mining, and other resource extraction industries. Programs to restock wolves in Yellowstone and to bolster the populations of grizzly bears and other large carnivores are opposed by some recreationists concerned for their safety and by many ranchers concerned with potential losses of livestock.

Large, high-profile vertebrates are not always the focal point in these conflicts, but habitat use is almost always at issue. Should work proceed on a new highway bridge if it destroys the only remaining habitat of a species of freshwater mussel? If you were the owner of a coffee plantation growing varieties that thrive in bright sunlight, do you think you would be willing to change to shade-tolerant coffee varieties that are less productive and less profitable but support large numbers of songbirds?

In addition to questions about human habitat needs, another important factor to weigh is the ecological role of species. Because we will not be able to save every endangered species, we must determine which ones are most important for conserving biodiversity as a whole. Species do not exert equal influence on community and ecosystem processes. Some organisms, called keystone species, have disproportionately large impacts relative to their numbers (see Chapter 53). Some keystone species significantly modify habitats, creating diverse patches that support numerous other species. Keystone mutualists provide other species with nutrients, defense against predators and parasites, or, in the case of pollinators, the means to reproduce. Identifying keystone species and finding ways to sustain their populations can ensure the continuance of numerous other species and can be central to the survival of whole communities. Conservation must move beyond its preoccupation with single species like the northern spotted owl and look at the whole community and ecosystem as an important unit of biodiversity.





 Edges and corridors can strongly influence landscape biodiversity

The boundaries, or edges, between ecosystems (between a lake and the surrounding forest, for example, or between cropland and suburban housing tracts) and within ecosystems (such as roadsides and rock outcroppings) are defining features of landscapes (FIGURE 55.15). An edge has its own set of physical conditions, such as soil type, topography, and disturbance features, that differ from those on either side. For instance, the soil surface of an edge between a forest patch and a burned area receives more sunlight and is usually hotter and drier than the forest interior but cooler and wetter than the soil surface in the burned area. Blown-down trees are a common disturbance feature of forest edges, which are less protected from strong winds than are forest interiors.

Fig 55-15. Edges between ecosystems. (a) Natural edges between ecosystems. In this landscape in Kakadu National Park in northern Australia, you can see edges of a dry forest, a rocky area with grassy islands, and a flat, grassy lakeshore. (b) Edges created by human activity. Human activities that degrade and fragment habitats often create edges that are more abrupt than those seen in natural landscapes. Pronounced edges (roads) surround clear-cuts in this photograph of a heavily logged rain forest in Malaysia.

Associated with their specific physical features, edges also have their own communities of organisms. Some organisms thrive in edge communities because they require resources of the two adjacent areas. For instance, a bird called the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellatus) needs forest habitat for nesting, winter food, and shelter, as well as forest openings with dense shrubs and herbs for summer food. White-tailed deer also thrive in edge habitats, where they can browse on woody shrubs, and deer populations often expand when forests are logged.

The proliferation of edge species can have positive or negative effects on a community's biodiversity. A recent study of edge communities in a tropical rain forest in Cameroon showed that these areas may be important sites of speciation. On the other hand, communities in which edges have proliferated as a result of human alterations often have reduced biodiversity owing to the preponderance of edge-adapted species. For example, populations of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), an edge-adapted species that lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, are currently expanding in many areas of the western United States. Cowbirds forage in open fields on insects disturbed by or attracted to cattle and other large herbivores, but they need forests where they can parasitize the nests of other birds. Cowbird numbers are burgeoning where forests are being heavily cut and fragmented, creating more edge habitat and open land for cattle, horses, and sheep. Increasing cowbird parasitism and loss of habitat are correlated with declining populations of several of the cowbird's host species--migratory songbirds such as the yellow warbler, red-eyed vireo, and American redstart.

Another important landscape feature, especially where habitats have been severely fragmented, is a movement corridor, a narrow strip or series of small clumps of quality habitat connecting otherwise isolated patches. Streamside habitats often serve as corridors, and government policy in some nations prohibits destruction of these riparian areas. In areas of heavy human use, artificial corridors are sometimes constructed. For example, highways bisect habitat patches required for survival of the few remaining Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi). The state of Florida has erected high fences to reduce road kills and artificial corridors under highways to allow movement through protected areas for the panthers (FIGURE 55.16).

Movement corridors can promote dispersal and reduce inbreeding in declining populations. Corridors are especially important to species that migrate among different habitats seasonally. However, a corridor can also be harmful--as, for example, in the spread of disease, especially among small populations in closely situated habitat patches. The effects of corridors have not been thoroughly studied, and researchers tend to evaluate their potential impact on a case-by-case basis.





 Conservation biologists face many challenges in setting up protected areas

Conservation biologists are applying current ecological research in setting up reserves or protected areas to slow the loss of biodiversity. National parks are examples of such protected places. In choosing locations for protection and designing nature reserves, conservation biologists face many challenges. If a community is subject to fire, grazing, and predation, for example, should the reserve be managed to minimize the risks of these processes to endangered or threatened species? Or should the reserve be left as natural as possible, with such processes as fires ignited by lightning allowed to play out without any human intervention? This is just one of the debates that arise among people who share an interest in the health of national parks and other protected areas.

Governments have set aside about 7%  of the world's land in various forms of reserves. How are these protected locations selected? Much of the focus has been on hot spots of biological diversity. A biodiversity hot spot is a relatively small area with an exceptional concentration of endemic species and a large number of endangered and threatened species. For example, nearly 30%  of all bird species are confined to only about 2%  of Earth's land area. And about 50,000 plant species, or 20%  of all known plant species, inhabit just 18 hot spots making up a total of only 0.5%  of the global land surface. Overall, the "hottest" of the biodiversity hot spots, including rain forests and dry shrublands (such as California's chaparral), total less than 1.5%  of Earth's land but are home to a third of all species of plants and vertebrates (FIGURE 55.17). Conservation biologists have also identified aquatic ecosystems, including certain river systems and coral reefs, as biodiversity hot spots.

Biodiversity hot spots are obviously good choices for nature reserves. However, recognizing hot spots is not always straightforward. And even if all hot spots could be protected, that effort would fall woefully short of conserving the planet's biodiversity. One problem is that a hot spot for one taxonomic group, such as birds, may not be a hot spot for some other taxonomic group, such as butterflies. Designating an area as a biodiversity hot spot is often taxonomically biased toward saving vertebrates and plants, with less attention paid to invertebrates and microorganisms. Some biologists are also concerned that the hot-spot strategy focuses so much of the conservation effort on such a small fraction of Earth's land.

As conservation biologists learn more about the requirements for achieving minimum viable population sizes for endangered species, it is becoming clear that most national parks and other reserves are far too small. For example, FIGURE 55.18 compares the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks with the actual area required to prevent extinction of grizzly bears. The biotic boundary, the area needed to sustain the grizzly, is more than ten times as large as the legal boundary, the actual area of the parks. Given political and economic realities, it is unlikely that many existing parks will be enlarged, and most new reserves will also be too small. Areas of private and public land surrounding reserves will have to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. In particular, this means integrating how land is used for agriculture and forestry into conservation strategies.

 Nature reserves must be functional parts of landscapes

Nature reserves are biodiversity islands in a sea of habitat degraded to varying degrees by human activity. It is important to realize, however, that protected "islands" are not isolated from their surroundings and that nonequilibrium ecology applies to nature reserves as well as the landscapes in which they are embedded.

An earlier policy--that protected areas should be set aside to remain unchanged forever--was based on the old concept that ecosystems are balanced, self-regulating units. However, as we have discussed in Chapter 53, disturbance is a functional component of all ecosystems, and management policies that ignore natural disturbances or attempt to prevent them have generally proved to be self-defeating. For instance, setting aside an area of a fire-dependent community, such as a portion of a tallgrass prairie, chaparral, or dry pine forest, with the intention of saving it is unrealistic if periodic burning is excluded. Without the dominant disturbance, the fire-adapted species are usually outcompeted by other species, and biodiversity is reduced.

Because human disturbance and fragmentation are increasingly common landscape features, patch dynamics, population dynamics, edges, and corridors are important in the design and management of protected areas. Unfortunately, there are many more questions than answers. For example, is it better to create one large preserve or a group of smaller preserves? One argument for extensive preserves is that large, far-ranging animals with low-density populations, such as the grizzly bear, require extensive habitats. In addition, more extensive areas have proportionately smaller perimeters than smaller areas and are therefore less affected by edges. An argument favoring smaller, disjunct preserves is that they may slow the spread of disease throughout a population. Often outweighing all other considerations, recent and ongoing land use by humans may largely dictate the size and shape of protected areas. Conservationists typically inherit the land that is useless for exploitation by agriculture or forestry.

Several nations have adopted an approach to landscape management called zoned reserve systems. A zoned reserve is an extensive region of land that includes one or more areas undisturbed by humans surrounded by lands that have been changed by human activity and are used for economic gain. The key challenge of the zoned reserve concept is the development of a social and economic climate in the surrounding lands that is compatible with the long-term viability of the protected core area. These surrounding areas continue to be used to support the human population, but with regulations that prevent the types of extensive alterations likely to impact the protected areas. As a result, surrounding tracts of land serve as buffer zones against further intrusion into the undisturbed areas.

The small Central American nation of Costa Rica has become a world leader in establishing zoned reserves. In exchange for reducing its international debt, the Costa Rican government established eight zoned reserves, called "conservation areas" (FIGURE 55.19). Costa Rica is making progress toward managing its zoned reserves, and the buffer zones provide a steady, lasting supply of forest products, water, and hydroelectric power and also support sustainable agriculture and tourism. An important goal is providing a stable economic base for people living there. As ecologist Daniel Janzen, a leader in tropical conservation, has said, "The likelihood of long-term survival of a conserved wildland area is directly proportional to the economic health and stability of the society in which that wildland is embedded." Destructive practices that are not compatible with long-term ecosystem conservation and from which there is often little local profit are gradually being discouraged. Such destructive practices include massive logging, large-scale single-crop agriculture, and extensive mining. Costa Rica looks to its zoned reserve system to maintain at least 80%  of its native species.

The continued high rate of human exploitation of ecosystems leads to the prediction that considerably less than 10%  of the biosphere will ever be protected as nature reserves. Sustaining biodiversity often involves working in landscapes that are almost entirely human dominated. For example, the Florida scrub jay, an endangered endemic species, inhabits dry scrub oak communities that have nearly been replaced by housing developments and citrus groves (FIGURE 55.20). Attempting to understand whether this species could coexist with human development, avian ecologist Reed Bowman, at the Archbold Biological Station in central Florida, examined scrub jay population viability across a gradient of human density. Unfortunately, housing developments, even if they contain some scrub habitats, turn out to be relatively poor environments for the jay. Bowman is now convinced that long-term survival of this bird depends on reserves of contiguous, intact scrub surrounded by areas where some natural vegetation remains--the zoned reserve concept applied to suburbia.

(b) New housing developments and expanding citrus groves threaten this bird and the remaining fragments of its unique habitat. Ecologists at the Archbold Biological Station, a small reserve with a stable scrub jay population, have found that housing developments do not provide enough food (arthropods) for the jays and are associated with higher mortality of adults. Even if a housing development contains some scrub habitat, it is a difficult place for these birds to rear enough young to offset the increased death rate. Archbold researchers predict that the Florida scrub jay will survive only if reserves of intact oak scrub habitat are maintained and properly managed with prescribed fire.





 Restoring degraded areas is an increasingly important conservation effort

Eventually, some areas that are altered by human activity are abandoned. For instance, the soils of many tropical areas become unproductive and are abandoned less than five years after being cleared for farming. Mining activities may last for several decades, but the lands are then abandoned in a degraded state. Many ecosystems are also damaged inadvertently by the dumping of toxic chemicals or such mishaps as oil spills. These degraded habitats and ecosystems are increasing in area because the natural rates of recovery by successional processes are slower than the rate of degradation by human activities.

A new subdiscipline of conservation biology called restoration ecology applies ecological principles in an effort to return degraded ecosystems to conditions as similar as possible to their natural, predegraded state. Restoration ecology seeks to reverse population and community declines. One basic assumption of restoration ecology is that most environmental damage is reversible. This optimism must be balanced by a second basic assumption--that communities are not infinitely resilient to damage.

Biological communities can recover naturally from many types of disturbances through a series of restoration mechanisms that occur during the various stages of ecological succession (see Chapter 53). The amount of time required for such natural recovery is more closely related to the spatial scale of the disturbance than the type of disturbance: The larger the area disturbed, the longer the time frame for recovery. Whether the disturbance is natural or caused by humans seems to make little difference in this size-time relationship (FIGURE 55.21). One of the goals of restoration ecology is to identify the processes that most limit the speed of recovery so that those factors can be manipulated to reduce the time it takes for a community to bounce back from the impact of disturbances. Thus, understanding the specific characteristics of succession after each type of disturbance and for each type of ecosystem provides essential background for restoration ecologists.

The aim of restoration ecology is to reduce the recovery time by manipulating ecological factors that slow recovery.

Two key strategies in restoration ecology are bioremediation and augmentation of ecosystem processes. Bioremediation is the use of living organisms, usually prokaryotes, fungi, or plants, to detoxify polluted ecosystems (see Chapter 27). Some plants adapted to soils with heavy metals are capable of accumulating high concentrations of potentially toxic metals such as zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium. Restoration ecologists can use these plants to revegetate sites degraded by mining and other human activities and then harvest the plants to recover the particular metals. A number of researchers are also focusing on the ability of certain prokaryotes and lichens to concentrate metals. Researchers in the United Kingdom recently discovered a lichen species that grows on soil polluted with uranium dust left over from mining. Useful as a biological monitor of uranium and potentially as a remediator, the lichen concentrates uranium in a dark pigment similar to melanin in human skin. And several extremeophilic bacteria and archaea thrive in natural environments similar to industrially polluted sites. Restoration ecologists have achieved some success in using the bacterium Pseudomonas, supplied with growth stimulants, to clean up oil spills on beaches. More common still is the use of certain prokaryotes to metabolize toxins in dump sites. Genetic engineering may become increasingly important as a tool for improving the performance of certain species as bioremediators.

In contrast to bioremediation, which is a strategy for removing harmful substances, biogiocal augmentation uses organisms to add essential materials to a degraded ecosystem. Augmenting ecosystem processes requires determining what factors, such as chemical nutrients, have been removed from an area and are limiting its rate of recovery. Encouraging the growth of plants that thrive in nutrient-poor soils often speeds up the rate of successional changes that can lead to recovery of damaged sites. Ariel Lugo, director of the U.S. Forest Service's Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, has evidence of a positive effect of an introduced plant species on the recovery of native vegetation (FIGURE 55.22). Thriving on nitrogen-poor soils, the leguminous plant Albizzia procera, exotic in Puerto Rico, helps set the stage for recolonization by native tropical forest species.

Fig 55-22. Restoration of degraded roadsides in the tropics. Forest ecologist Ariel Lugo has monitored rapid regrowth of indigenous communities along roadsides in Puerto Rico. An exotic plant, Albizzia procera (shown here), which thrives on nitrogen-poor soils, first colonized these sites after the original forest was removed and soils were depleted of nutrients. Apparently, the rapid buildup of organic material from dense stands of Albizzia enabled indigenous plants to recolonize the area and overgrow the exotic plant in a relatively brief time.

To date, the most extensive and successful restoration projects have been in marginally disturbed wetlands in landscapes where biodiversity has not been greatly depleted. In these projects, restoring the natural water flow patterns and replanting indigenous vegetation have led to recolonization by animal populations. Restoring viable populations of highly sensitive wetland species to heavily degraded wetlands is much more challenging, as are similar restoration efforts in most ecosystems.

Because of the novelty of restoration science, the complexity of ecosystems, and the unique features of each situation, restoration ecologists usually must learn as they go. Many restoration ecologists advocate adaptive management, which is the use of the experimental method in trying several promising types of management to find out what works best. The key to adaptive management and the key to restoration ecology is to consider alternative ways of accomplishing goals and to learn from mistakes. The long-term objective of restoration is to speed the reestablishment of the predisturbance ecosystem. But a pragmatic initial goal is often to approximate the original ecosystem, which can be accomplished much sooner than complete restoration to the original state.





 The goal of sustainable development is reorienting ecological research and challenging all of us to reassess our values

Facing increasing loss and fragmentation of habitats, how can we best manage Earth's resources? If we are to conserve most of a nation's species, which habitat patches are most crucial? Among the limited choices, which areas are most practical to protect and manage if we are to save rare species or the greatest number of species?

We must understand the complex interconnections of the biosphere if we are to make sensible decisions about how to conserve these networks. To this end, many nations, scientific societies, and private foundations have embraced the concept of sustainable development, the long-term prosperity of human societies and the ecosystems that support them. The forward-looking Ecological Society of America, the world's largest organization of professional ecologists, endorses a research agenda called the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative. The goal of this initiative is to define and acquire the basic ecological information necessary for the intelligent and responsible development, management, and conservation of Earth's resources. The research agenda includes studies of global change, including interactions between climate and ecological processes; biological diversity and its role in maintaining ecological processes; and the ways in which the productivity of natural and artificial ecosystems can be sustained. This initiative requires a strong commitment of human and economic resources.

Sustainable development, of course, is not just about science. It depends on most of us reassessing our values. Those of us living in affluent developed nations are responsible for the greatest amount of environmental degradation. Reality demands that we distinguish what we need from what we want, learn to revere the natural processes that sustain us, and reduce our orientation toward short-term personal gain. The current state of the biosphere demonstrates that we are treading precariously on uncharted ecological ground and that the importance of our scientific and personal efforts cannot be overstated.

Conservation science is an intersection of numerous facets of biology, including ecology, evolution, physiology, molecular biology, genetics, and behavior. Efforts to sustain ecosystem processes and stem the loss of biodiversity also connect life science with the social sciences, economics, and humanities. In fact, we'll end our book with a note of optimism based on our humanity.





 The future of the biosphere may depend on our biophilia

Despite the uncertainties about the future of the biosphere, now is not the time for gloom and doom but the time to reconnect with the rest of nature. Not many people today live in truly wild environments or even visit such places often. Our modern lives are very different from those of early humans, who hunted and gathered and painted wildlife murals on cave walls. But our behavior reflects remnants of our ancestral attachment to nature and the diversity of life--what Edward O. Wilson calls biophilia (FIGURE 55.23). Biophilia includes our sense of connection to diverse organisms and also our attraction to pristine landscapes with clean water and lush vegetation. We evolved in natural environments rich in biodiversity, and we still have an affinity for such settings. Wilson makes the case that our biophilia is innate, an evolutionary product of natural selection acting on a brainy species whose survival depended on a close connection to the environment and a practical appreciation of plants and animals.

Fig 55-23. Biophilia, past and present. (a) Art history goes way back--and so does our fascination with and dependence on biodiversity. A Cro-Magnon wildlife artist created this remarkable painting of rhinoceroses about 30,000 years ago. Three cave explorers found the painting in a prehistoric art gallery on Christmas Eve, 1994, when they ventured into a cavern near Vallon-Pont d'Arc, in southern France. (b) Biologist Carlos Rivera Gonzales, who is participating in a biodiversity survey in a remote region of Peru, could not resist a closer look at a tiny tree frog.

It will come as no surprise that most biologists have embraced the concept of biophilia. After all, these are people who have turned their passion for nature into careers. But biophilia strikes a harmonic chord with biologists for another reason. If biophilia is evolutionarily embedded in our genomes, then there is hope that we can become better custodians of the biosphere. If we all pay more attention to our biophilia, a new environmental ethic could catch on among individuals and societies. And that ethic is a resolve never to knowingly allow a single species to become extinct or any ecosystem to be destroyed as long as there are reasonable ways to prevent such ecological violence. It is an environmental ethic that balances out another human trait--our tendency to "subdue Earth." Yes, we should be motivated to preserve biodiversity because we depend on it for food, medicine, building materials, fertile soil, flood control, habitable climate, drinkable water, and breathable air. But maybe we can also work harder to prevent the extinction of other forms of life just because it is the ethical thing for us to do as the most thoughtful species in the biosphere. Again, Wilson sounds the call: "Right now, we're pushing the species of the world through a bottleneck. We've got to make it a major moral principle to get as many of them through this as possible. It's the challenge now and for the next century. And there's one good thing about our species: We like a challenge!"

It is appropriate that we end this textbook with biophilia, for biology is a scientific expression of our desire to know nature. We are most likely to save what we appreciate, and we are most likely to appreciate what we understand. By learning about the processes and diversity of life, we also become more aware of ourselves and our place in the biosphere. We hope this book serves you well in this lifelong adventure.
