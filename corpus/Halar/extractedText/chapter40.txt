It is natural for us to be curious about how our bodies work. In these chapters on animal form and function, you will indeed learn much about human anatomy and physiology. But the scope of this unit of chapters is not limited to humans or even to vertebrates. The study of animal form and function is integrated by the common set of problems that all animals must solve. How, for example, do animals as different as hydras, halibut, and humans obtain oxygen from their environments? How do they nourish themselves? excrete waste products? move? Our main goal in this unit of chapters is to see how animals of diverse evolutionary history and varying complexity solve these general challenges of life. This chapter introduces the unit with some unifying concepts that apply across the animal kingdom.

 Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment



An animal's size and shape, features that biologists often call body plans or designs, are fundamental aspects of form and function that significantly affect the way an animal interacts with its environment. By using the terms plan and design here, we do not mean to imply that animal body forms are products of a conscious invention. The body plan or design of an animal results from a pattern of development programmed by the genome, itself the product of millions of years of evolution due to natural selection.

 Animal form and function reflect biology's major themes

Animals provide vivid examples of biology's overarching theme of evolution. The adaptations we will observe in our comparative study of animals evolved by natural selection. The long, tonguelike proboscis of the hawk moth in the photo you see on this page is a structural adaptation for feeding. Recoiled when not in use, the proboscis extends as a straw through which the moth can suck nectar from deep within tube-shaped flowers.

A foraging hawk moth illustrates another major theme, one we introduced in Chapter 1: regulation. While natural selection provides a mechanism for long-term adaptation, organisms also have the capacity to adjust to environmental change over the short term by physiological responses (these short-term responses are themselves evolutionary adaptations). Many insects are inactive when it is cold. But Manduca sexta, the hawk moth species in our opening photo, can forage for nectar when air temperatures are as low as 5&#176;C. The moth uses a shivering-like mechanism for preflight warm-up of its muscles. Once the moth takes off, metabolic activity of its flight muscles generates heat, and a variety of regulatory adaptations maintain a temperature of about 30&#176;C in the muscles, even though the external temperature may be close to freezing. (You'll learn more about this regulation in Chapter 44.)

Searching for food, generating body heat and regulating internal temperature, sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, and all other animal activities require fuel in the form of chemical energy. Thus, we will apply concepts of bioenergetics--how organisms obtain, process, and use their energy resources--as another theme throughout our comparative study of animals.

And there's one more theme to guide our study of animals: the correlation of structure and function. Which is the better utensil: a spoon or a fork? The answer, of course, depends on what you are trying to eat. Given a choice of tools, you would not eat broth with a fork or a salad with a spoon. Form fits function. The same principle applies to life at its many levels, from molecules to organisms. Analyzing a biological structure such as a hawk moth's proboscis gives us clues about what it does and how it works. Conversely, knowing the function of a structure provides insight about its construction, such as the strawlike anatomy of Manduca's proboscis. Anatomy is the study of the structure of an organism; physiology is the study of the functions an organism performs. The distinction blurs when we apply the structure-function theme, and "anatomy-and-physiology" then rolls off the tongue as though it were one big compound noun. We could use the term functional anatomy instead. But here, our analogy to human inventions such as eating utensils breaks down. Without any sort of goal, natural selection can fit structure to function by selecting, over many generations, for what works best among the available options presented by a varying population. Thus, the form-function principle is just another extension of biology's central theme of evolution.





 Function correlates with structure in the tissues of animals

Life is characterized by hierarchical levels of organization, each with emergent properties (see Chapter 1). Animals are multicellular organisms with their specialized cells grouped into tissues. In most animals, combinations of various tissues make up functional units called organs, and groups of organs that work together form organ systems. For example, the human digestive system consists of a stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and several other organs, each a composite of different kinds of tissues.

Tissues are groups of cells with a common structure and function. Different types of tissues have different structures that are especially suited to their functions. A tissue may be held together by a sticky extracellular matrix that coats the cells (see FIGURE 7.29) or weaves them together in a fabric of fibers. Indeed, the term tissue is from a Latin word meaning "weave."

Tissues are classified into four main categories: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, nervous tissue, and muscle tissue. These are present to some extent in all but the simplest animals; the following survey emphasizes the tissues of vertebrates.

Epithelial Tissue

Occurring in sheets of tightly packed cells, epithelial tissue covers the outside of the body and lines organs and cavities within the body (FIGURE 40.1, p. 836). The cells of an epithelium are closely joined, with little material between them. In many epithelia, the cells are riveted together by tight junctions (see FIGURE 7.30). This tight packing enables the epithelium to function as a barrier protecting against mechanical injury, invasive microorganisms, and fluid loss. The free surface of the epithelium is exposed to air or fluid, whereas the cells at the base of the barrier are attached to a basement membrane, a dense mat of extracellular matrix.

Fig 40-1. The structure and function of epithelial tissues. The structure of an epithelium fits its function.

Two criteria for classifying epithelia (plural) are the number of cell layers and the shape of the cells on the free surface. A simple epithelium has a single layer of cells, whereas a stratified epithelium has multiple tiers of cells. A pseudostratified epithelium is single-layered, but it appears to be stratified because the cells vary in length. The shape of the cells that are at the free surface of an epithelium may be cuboidal (like dice), columnar (like bricks on end), or squamous (flat like floor tiles). Combining the features of cell shape and number of layers, we get such terms as simple cuboidal epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium (see FIGURE 40.1).

As well as protecting the organs they line, some epithelia, called glandular epithelia, absorb or secrete chemical solutions. For example, glandular epithelia lining tubules in the thyroid gland secrete a hormone that regulates the body's rate of fuel consumption. The glandular epthelia that line the lumen (cavity) of the digestive and respiratory tracts form a mucous membrane; they secrete a slimy solution called mucus that lubricates the surface and keeps it moist. The free epithelial surfaces of some mucous membranes have beating cilia that move the film of mucus along the surface. For example, the ciliated epithelium of our respiratory tubes helps keep our lungs clean by trapping dust and other particles and sweeping them back up the trachea (windpipe).

Connective Tissue

Connective tissue functions mainly to bind and support other tissues. In contrast to epithelia, with their tightly packed cells, connective tissues have a sparse population of cells scattered through an extracellular matrix. The matrix generally consists of a web of fibers embedded in a uniform foundation that may be liquid, jellylike, or solid. In most cases, the substances of the matrix are secreted by the cells of the connective tissue.

Connective tissue fibers, which are made of protein, are of three kinds: collagenous fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagenous fibers are made of collagen, probably the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom. Collagenous fibers are nonelastic and do not tear easily when pulled lengthwise. If you pinch and pull some skin on the back of your hand, it is mainly collagen that keeps the flesh from tearing away from the bone. Elastic fibers are long threads made of a protein called elastin. Elastic fibers provide a rubbery quality that complements the nonelastic strength of collagenous fibers. When you pinch the back of your hand and then let go, elastic fibers quickly restore your skin to its original shape. Reticular fibers are very thin and branched. Composed of collagen and continuous with collagenous fibers, they form a tightly woven fabric that joins connective tissue to adjacent tissues.

The major types of connective tissue in vertebrates are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood (FIGURE 40.2). Each has a structure correlated with its specialized functions.

The most widespread connective tissue in the vertebrate body is loose connective tissue. It binds epithelia to underlying tissues and functions as packing material, holding organs in place. This type of connective tissue gets its name from the loose weave of its fibers. Loose connective tissue has all three fiber types: collagenous, elastic, and reticular.

Among the cells scattered in the fibrous mesh of loose connective tissue, two types predominate: fibroblasts and macrophages. Fibroblasts secrete the protein ingredients of the extracellular fibers. Macrophages are amoeboid cells that roam the maze of fibers, engulfing bacteria and the debris of dead cells by phagocytosis (see Chapter 8). They are weapons in an elaborate arsenal of defense you will learn more about in Chapter 43.

Adipose tissue is a specialized form of loose connective tissue that stores fat in adipose cells distributed throughout its matrix. Adipose tissue pads and insulates the body and stores fuel as fat molecules (see FIGURE 4.5). Each adipose cell contains a large fat droplet that swells when fat is stored and shrinks when the body uses fat as fuel.

Fibrous connective tissue is dense, due to its large numbers of collagenous fibers. The fibers are organized into parallel bundles, an arrangement that maximizes nonelastic strength. We find this type of connective tissue in tendons, which attach muscles to bones, and in ligaments, which join bones together at joints.

Cartilage has an abundance of collagenous fibers embedded in a rubbery matrix made of a substance called chondroitin sulfate, a protein-carbohydrate complex. Chondroitin sulfate and collagen are secreted by cells called chondrocytes (see FIGURE 40.2). The composite of collagenous fibers and chondroitin sulfate makes cartilage a strong yet somewhat flexible support material. The skeleton of a shark is made of cartilage. Other vertebrates, including humans, have cartilaginous skeletons during the embryo stage, but most of the cartilage is replaced by bone as the embryo matures. We nevertheless retain cartilage as flexible support in certain locations, such as the nose, the ears, the rings that reinforce the windpipe, the discs that act as cushions between our vertebrae, and the caps on the ends of some bones.

The skeleton supporting the body of most vertebrates is made of bone, a mineralized connective tissue. Bone-forming cells called osteoblasts deposit a matrix of collagen. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ions combine and harden within the matrix into the mineral hydroxyapatite. The combination of hard mineral and flexible collagen makes bone harder than cartilage without being brittle. The microscopic structure of hard mammalian bone consists of repeating units called osteons (or Haversian systems) (see FIGURE 40.2). Each osteon has concentric layers of the mineralized matrix, which are deposited around a central canal containing blood vessels and nerves that service the bone. Once osteoblasts become trapped in their own secretions, they are called osteocytes. (We will examine bones and skeletons in more detail in Chapter 49.)

Although blood functions differently from other connective tissues, it does meet the criterion of having an extensive extracellular matrix. In this case, the matrix is a liquid called plasma, consisting of water, salts, and a variety of dissolved proteins. Suspended in the plasma are two classes of blood cells, erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells), and cell fragments called platelets. Red cells carry oxygen; white cells function in defense against viruses, bacteria, and other invaders; and platelets aid in blood clotting. Blood will be discussed in detail in Chapters 42 and 43.

Nervous Tissue

Nervous tissue senses stimuli and transmits signals from one part of the animal to another. The functional unit of nervous tissue is the neuron, or nerve cell, which is uniquely specialized to transmit signals called nerve impulses (FIGURE 40.3). It consists of a cell body and two or more extensions, or processes, called dendrites and axons, which may be as long as a meter in humans. Dendrites transmit impulses from their tips toward the rest of the neuron. Axons transmit impulses toward another neuron or toward an effector, a structure such as a muscle cell that carries out a body response. We will postpone a detailed discussion of the structure and function of neurons until Chapter 48.

Muscle Tissue

Muscle tissue is composed of long cells called muscle fibers that are capable of contracting when stimulated by nerve impulses. Arranged in parallel within the cytoplasm of muscle fibers are large numbers of myofibrils made of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. Muscle is the most abundant tissue in most animals, and muscle contraction accounts for much of the energy-consuming cellular work in an active animal.

In the vertebrate body, there are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (FIGURE 40.4). Attached to bones by tendons, skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movements of the body. Adults have a fixed number of muscle cells; weight lifting and other methods of building muscle do not increase the number of cells but simply enlarge those already present. Skeletal muscle is also called striated muscle because the arrangement of overlapping filaments gives the cells a striped (striated) appearance under the microscope.

Fig 40-4. Three kinds of vertebrate muscle.

Cardiac muscle forms the contractile wall of the heart. It is striated like skeletal muscle, but cardiac cells are branched. The ends of the cells are joined by structures called intercalated discs, which relay signals from cell to cell during a heartbeat.

Smooth muscle, so named because it lacks striations, is found in the walls of the digestive tract, urinary bladder, arteries, and other internal organs. The cells are spindle-shaped. They contract more slowly than skeletal muscles but can remain contracted longer. Controlled by different kinds of nerves than those controlling skeletal muscles, smooth muscles are responsible for involuntary body activities, such as churning of the stomach or constriction of arteries. You will learn more about the control and contraction of muscles in Chapter 49.





 The organ systems of an animal are interdependent

In all but the simplest animals (sponges and some cnidarians), different tissues are organized into organs. In some organs the tissues are arranged in layers. For example, the vertebrate stomach has four major tissue layers (FIGURE 40.5). A thick epithelium lines the lumen and secretes mucus and digestive juices into it. Outside this layer is a zone of connective tissue, surrounded by a thick layer of smooth muscle. Yet another layer of connective tissue encapsulates the entire stomach.

Fig 40-5. Tissue layers of the stomach, a digestive organ. The wall of the stomach and other tubular organs of the digestive system has four main tissue layers.

Many of the organs of vertebrates are suspended by sheets of connective tissue called mesenteries in body cavities moistened or filled with fluid. Mammals have a thoracic cavity housing the lungs and heart that is separated from the lower abdominal cavity by a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm.

A level of organization higher than organs, organ systems carry out the major body functions of most animals (TABLE 40.1, p. 840). Each organ system consists of several organs and has specific functions, but the efforts of all systems must be coordinated for the animal to survive. For instance, nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract are distributed throughout the body by the circulatory system. But the heart that pumps blood through the circulatory system depends on nutrients absorbed by the digestive tract and also on oxygen (O2) obtained from the air or water by the respiratory system. Any organism, whether single-celled or an assembly of organ systems, is a coordinated living whole greater than the sum of its parts.

 Physical laws constrain animal form

Imagine the horror of wading into a murky lake and feeling your legs engulfed by a squishy amoeba the size of a pro wrestler. Fortunately, you don't have to add this to your worry list. It will never happen. Physical requirements constrain what natural selection can "invent," including the size of single cells. An amoeba the size of a human could never move materials across its membrane fast enough to satisfy such a large blob of cytoplasm. This is just one example of how physical law--in this case, the math of surface-to-volume relations--affects the evolution of an organism's form.

Consider another example: how the laws of hydrodynamics constrain the shapes that are possible for aquatic animals that swim very fast. Tuna and other fast bony fishes can swim at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour. Sharks, penguins (birds), and aquatic mammals such as dolphins, seals, and whales are also fast swimmers. And they all have the same basic body shape. It's called a fusiform shape, which means tapered on both ends (FIGURE 40.6). Water is about a thousand times denser than air, and thus the slightest bump that causes drag impedes a swimmer even more than it does a runner or a flyer. We should expect speedy fishes and marine mammals to have similar shapes, because the laws of hydrodynamics are universal. This is an example of convergent evolution (see Chapter 25). Convergence occurs because natural selection shapes similar adaptations when diverse organisms face the same environmental challenge, such as the resistance of water to fast travel.

 Body size and shape affect interactions with the environment

An animal's size and shape have a direct effect on how the animal exchanges energy and materials with its surroundings. As a requirement for maintaining the fluid integrity of the plasma membranes of its cells, an animal body must be arranged so that all of its living cells are bathed in an aqueous medium. Exchange with the environment occurs as dissolved substances diffuse and are transported across the plasma membranes between the cells and their aqueous surroundings. As shown in FIGURE 40.7a, a single-celled protist living in water has a sufficient surface area of plasma membrane to service its entire volume of cytoplasm because it is so small. A large cell has less surface area relative to its volume than a smaller cell of the same shape (see FIGURE 7.5). As you learned in the preceding concept, this is one of the physical constraints on the size of protists such as amoebas.

Fig 40-7. Contact with the environment. (a) In a unicellular organism, such as this amoeba, the entire surface area contacts the environment. Because of its small size, the cell has a large surface area relative to its volume through which to exchange materials with the external world. (b) A hydra is bilayered. Because the aqueous environment can circulate in and out of its mouth, virtually every one of its cells directly contacts the environment and exchanges materials with it.

Multicellular animals are composed of microscopic cells, each with its own plasma membrane that functions as a loading and unloading platform for a modest volume of cytoplasm. But this only works if all the cells of the animal have access to a suitable aqueous environment. A hydra, built on the sac plan, has a body wall only two cell layers thick (FIGURE 40.7b). Because its gastrovascular cavity opens to the exterior, both outer and inner layers of cells are bathed in water. A flat body shape is another way to maximize exposure to the surrounding medium. For instance, a tapeworm may be several meters long, but because it is very thin, most of its cells are bathed in the intestinal fluid of the worm's vertebrate host, from which it obtains nutrients.

Two-layered sacs and flat shapes are designs that put a large surface area in contact with the environment, but these simple forms do not allow much complexity in internal organization. Most animals are more complex and made up of compact masses of cells; their outer surfaces are relatively small compared with their volume. As an extreme comparison, the surface-to-volume ratio of a whale is millions of times smaller than that of a protozoan, yet every cell in the whale must be bathed in fluid and have access to oxygen, nutrients, and other resources. Whales and most other animals have extensively folded or branched internal surfaces specialized for exchange with the environment (FIGURE 40.8, p. 842). The circulatory system shuttles materials among all the exchange surfaces within the animal.

Fig 40-8. Internal exchange surfaces of complex animals. This diagrammatic animal illustrates logistics of chemical exchange with the environment by a mammal. Most animals have expansive surfaces that are specialized for exchanging certain chemicals with the surroundings. These exchange surfaces are usually internal, but are connected to the environment via openings on the body surface (the mouth, for example). The exchange surfaces are finely branched or folded, giving them a very large area. The digestive, respiratory, and excretory systems all have such specialized surfaces. Chemicals that are transported across these surfaces are carried throughout the body by the circulatory system.

Although exchange with the environment is a problem for animals whose cells are mostly internal, complex body forms have distinct benefits. Because the animal's external surface need not be bathed in water, it is possible for the animal to live on land. Also, because the immediate environment for the cells is the internal body fluid, the animal's organ systems can control the composition of the solution bathing its cells.





 Mechanisms of homeostasis moderate changes in the internal environment

More than a century ago, French physiologist Claude Bernard made the distinction between the external environment surrounding an animal and the internal environment in which the cells of the animal actually live. The internal environment of vertebrates is called the interstitial fluid (see FIGURE 40.8). This fluid, which fills the spaces between our cells, exchanges nutrients and wastes with blood contained in microscopic vessels called capillaries. Bernard also recognized that many animals tend to maintain relatively constant conditions in their internal environment, even when the external environment changes. A pond-dwelling hydra is powerless to affect the temperature of the fluid that bathes its cells, but the human body can maintain its "internal pond" at a more-or-less constant temperature of about 37&#176;C. Our bodies also can control the pH of our blood and interstitial fluid to within a tenth of a pH unit of 7.4, and regulate the amount of sugar in our blood so that it does not fluctuate for long from a concentration of 0.1% . There are times, of course, during the development of an animal when major changes in the internal environment are programmed to occur. For example, the balance of hormones in human blood is altered radically during puberty and pregnancy. Still, the stability of the internal environment is remarkable.

Today, Bernard's "constant internal milieu" is incorporated into the concept of homeostasis, which means "steady state," or internal balance. One of the main objectives of modern physiology, and a theme of this unit, is to learn how animals maintain homeostasis. Actually, the internal environment of an animal always fluctuates slightly. Homeostasis is a dynamic state, an interplay between outside forces that tend to change the internal environment and internal control mechanisms that oppose such changes.





 Homeostasis depends on feedback circuits

Any homeostatic control system has three functional components: a receptor, a control center, and an effector. The receptor detects a change in some variable of the animal's internal environment, such as change in body temperature. The control center processes information it receives from the receptor and directs an appropriate response by the effector. As a nonliving example of how these components interact, consider how the temperature of a room is controlled (FIGURE 40.9a). In this case, the control center, called a thermostat, also contains the receptor (a thermometer). When room temperature falls below a set point, say 20&#176;C, the thermostat switches on the heater (the effector). When the thermometer detects a temperature above the set point, the thermostat switches the heater off. This type of control circuit is called negative feedback, because a change in the variable being monitored triggers the control mechanism to counteract further change in the same direction. Owing to a lag time between reception and response, the variable drifts slightly above and below the set point, but the fluctuations are moderate. Negative-feedback mechanisms prevent small changes from becoming too large. Most homeostatic mechanisms in animals operate on this principle of negative feedback.

Fig 40-9. An example of negative feedback: control of temperature. Regulating either (a) room or (b) body temperature depends on a control center that detects temperature change and activates mechanisms that reverse that change.

Our own body temperature is kept close to a set point of 37&#176;C by the cooperation of several negative-feedback circuits that regulate energy exchange with the environment (FIGURE 40.9b). One of these involves sweating as a means to dispose of metabolic heat and cool the body. A thermostat in the brain monitors the temperature of the blood. If the thermostat detects a rise in body temperature above the set point, it sends nerve impulses directing sweat glands to increase their production of sweat, thereby lowering body temperature by evaporative cooling (see FIGURE 3.4). When body temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat in the brain stops sending the signals to the glands, and the body retains more of the heat produced by metabolism. We will see several examples of negative feedback in the chapters that follow.

In contrast to negative feedback, positive feedback involves a change in some variable that triggers mechanisms that amplify rather than reverse the change. During childbirth, for instance, the pressure of the baby's head against sensors near the opening of the uterus stimulates uterine contractions, which cause greater pressure against the uterine opening, heightening the contractions, which causes still greater pressure. Positive feedback brings childbirth to completion, a very different sort of process from maintaining a steady state.

It is important not to overstate the concept of a constant internal environment. In fact, regulated change is essential to normal body functions. In some cases the changes are cyclical, such as the changes in hormone levels responsible for the menstrual cycle in women (see Chapter 46). In other cases a regulated change is a reaction to a challenge to the body. For example, the human body reacts to certain infections by raising the set point for temperature to a slightly higher level, and the resulting fever helps fight the infection. Over the short term, homeostatic mechanisms keep body temperature close to a set point, whatever it is at that particular time. But over the longer term, homeostasis allows regulated change in the body's internal environment.

Internal regulation is expensive. Anyone who pays utility bills is aware of the energy costs for heating or cooling a home to maintain a comfortable interior temperature. Similarly, animals use a considerable portion of the energy from the food they eat to maintain favorable internal conditions. Animals must manage their energy resources not only for homeostasis, but for everything else they do, including movement, defense against disease, and reproduction. Let's take a closer look at some basic concepts of animal energetics.





 Animals are heterotrophs that harvest chemical energy from the food they eat

All organisms require chemical energy for growth, physiological processes, maintenance and repair, regulation, and reproduction. Plants use light energy to build energy-rich organic molecules from water and CO2, and then use those organic molecules for fuel. In contrast, animals are heterotrophs and must obtain their chemical energy in food, which contains organic molecules synthesized by other organisms. Food is digested by enzymatic hydrolysis (see FIGURE 5.2), and energy-containing fuel molecules are absorbed by body cells. Once absorbed, fuel molecules have several possible fates. Most are used to generate ATP by the catabolic processes of cellular respiration and fermentation (see Chapter 9). The chemical energy of ATP powers cellular work, enabling cells, organs, and organ systems to perform the many functions that keep an animal alive. Since the production and use of ATP generates heat, an animal must continuously lose heat to its surroundings (heat balance is discussed in more detail in Chapter 44).

After the energetic needs of staying alive are met, any remaining food molecules can be used in biosynthesis, including body growth and repair, synthesis of storage material such as fat, and production of reproductive structures, including gametes (FIGURE 40.10). Biosynthesis requires both carbon skeletons for new structures and ATP to power their assembly. In some situations, biosynthetic products (such as body fat) can be broken down into fuel molecules for production of additional ATP, depending on the needs of the animal (see FIGURE 9.19).

 Metabolic rate provides clues to an animal's bioenergetic "strategy"

The flow of energy through an animal--the animal's bioenergetics--ultimately sets the limits to the animal's behavior, growth, and reproduction and determines how much food it needs. An understanding of bioenergetics tells us a great deal about an animal's adaptations and how it fits into its environment as an energy consumer. How much of the total energy an animal obtains from food does it need just to stay alive? How much energy must be expended to walk, run, swim, or fly from one place to another? What fraction of energy intake can be used for reproduction? Physiologists obtain answers to such questions by measuring the rates at which animals use chemical energy and how these rates change in different circumstances.

The amount of energy an animal uses in a unit of time is called its metabolic rate--the sum of all the energy-requiring biochemical reactions occurring over a given time interval. Energy is measured in calories (cal) or kilocalories (kcal). (A kilocalorie is 1,000 calories. The term Calorie, with a capital C, as used by many nutritionists, is actually a kilocalorie.)

Metabolic rate can be determined in several ways. Because nearly all of the chemical energy used in cellular respiration eventually appears as heat, metabolic rate can be measured by monitoring an animal's rate of heat loss. An animal is placed in a calorimeter, which is a closed, insulated chamber equipped with a device that records the animal's heat loss. Calorimeters are used most often with small animals, since they are cumbersome with large animals. A more indirect way to measure metabolic rate is to determine the amount of oxygen consumed or carbon dioxide produced by an animal's cellular respiration (FIGURE 40.11). Over long periods, the rate of food consumption and the energy content of the food (about 4.5-5 kcal per gram of protein or carbohydrate and about 9 kcal per gram of fat) can be used to estimate metabolic rate, but this method must account for the energy in food that cannot be used by the animal (the energy lost in feces and urine).

Fig 40-11. Measuring metabolic rate.

There are two basic bioenergetic "strategies" used by animals. Birds and mammals are mainly endothermic, meaning their bodies are warmed by heat generated by metabolism, and their body temperature must be maintained at a certain level to sustain life (see Chapter 34). Endothermy is a high-energy strategy that permits intense, long-duration activity over a wide range of environmental temperatures. In contrast, most fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates are ectothermic, meaning they do not produce enough metabolic heat to have much effect on body temperature. The ectothermic strategy requires much less energy than is needed by endotherms, because of the energy cost of heating (or cooling) an endothermic body. However, ectotherms are generally incapable of intense activity over long periods.





 Metabolic rate per gram is inversely related to body size among similar animals

One of animal biology's most intriguing but largely unanswered questions has to do with the relationship between body size and metabolic rate. By measuring the metabolic rates of many species of vertebrates and invertebrates, physiologists have shown that the amount of energy it takes to maintain each gram of body weight is inversely related to body size. Each gram of a mouse, for instance, consumes about 20 times more calories than a gram of an elephant (even though the whole elephant, of course, uses far more calories than the whole mouse). The higher metabolic rate of a smaller animal's tissues demands a proportionately greater rate of delivery of oxygen. And correlated with its higher metabolic rate, the smaller animal also has a higher breathing rate, blood volume (relative to its size), and heart rate (pulse) and must eat much more food per unit of body mass.

What explains the inverse relationship between metabolic rate and size? One hypothesis is that for endotherms, the smaller the animal, the greater the energy cost of maintaining a stable body temperature. This idea stems from the surface area to volume relationship: The smaller an animal, the greater its surface area to volume ratio, and thus the greater the loss of heat to (or gain of heat from) the surroundings. Logical as this hypothesis appears to be, it fails to explain the inverse relationship between metabolism and size in ectotherms (which do not use metabolic heat to maintain body temperature) and is not supported by various experimental tests. Researchers continue to search for causes underlying the inverse relationship between body size and metabolic rate.





 Animals adjust their metabolic rates as conditions change

Every animal has a range of metabolic rates. Minimal rates power the basic functions that support life, such as cell maintenance, breathing, and heartbeat. The metabolic rate of a nongrowing endotherm at rest, with an empty stomach, and experiencing no stress, is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR). The BMR for humans averages about 1,600 to 1,800 kcal per day for adult males and about 1,300 to 1,500 kcal per day for adult females. These BMRs are about equivalent to the energy consumption of a 75-watt light bulb.

In ectotherms, body temperature changes with the temperature of the surroundings, and so does metabolic rate. Unlike BMRs, which can be determined within a range of environmental temperatures, the minimal metabolic rate of an ectotherm must be determined at a specific temperature. The metabolic rate of a resting, fasting, nonstressed ectotherm is called its standard metabolic rate (SMR).

For both ectotherms and endotherms, activity has a large effect on metabolic rate. Any behavior, even a person working quietly at a desk or an insect extending its wings, consumes energy beyond the BMR or SMR. Maximal metabolic rates (the highest rates of ATP utilization) occur during peak activity, such as lifting heavy weights, all-out running, or high-speed swimming.

In general, an animal's maximum possible metabolic rate is inversely related to the duration of activity. FIGURE 40.12 contrasts the ectothermic and endothermic "strategies" for sustaining activity over different time intervals. Both an alligator (ectotherm) and a human (endotherm) are capable of very intense exercise in short spurts of a minute or less. During these "sprints," the ATP present in muscle cells and ATP generated anaerobically by glycolysis can power the activity. Neither the ectotherm nor the endotherm can sustain their maximum metabolic rates and peak levels of activity over longer periods of exercise, though the endotherm has an advantage in such endurance tests. Sustained activity depends on the aerobic process of cellular respiration for ATP supply, and an endotherm's respiration rate is about 10 times greater than an ectotherm's. Only endotherms are capable of long-duration activities such as distance running.

The two bars at the far right compare the resting metabolic rates for an ectotherm (alligator) versus an endotherm (human) of equivalent size. Note the much higher energy cost required for the endothermic "strategy." The other bars compare the two animals for their maximum potential metabolic rates and ATP sources over different durations of time.

Between the extremes of BMR or SMR and maximal metabolic rate, many factors influence energy requirements, including age, sex, size, body and environmental temperatures, the quality and quantity of food, activity level, oxygen availability, hormonal balance, and time of day. Birds, humans, and many insects are usually active (and therefore have their highest metabolic rates) during daylight hours. In contrast, bats, mice, and many other mammals generally are active and have their highest metabolic rates at night or during the hours of dawn and dusk. Metabolic rates measured when animals are performing a variety of activities give a better idea of the energy costs of everyday life. For most terrestrial animals (both ectotherms and endotherms), the average daily rate of energy consumption is 2-4 times BMR or SMR. Humans in most developed countries have an unusually low average daily metabolic rate of about 1.5 times BMR--an indication of relatively sedentary lifestyles.





 Energy budgets reveal how animals use energy and materials

Different species of animals use the energy and materials in food in different ways, depending on their environment, behavior, size, and basic energy "strategy" of endothermy or ectothermy. For most animals, the majority of food is devoted to the production of ATP, and relatively little goes to growth or reproduction. However, the amount of energy used for BMR (or SMR), activity, and temperature control varies considerably between species. For example, consider the typical annual energy "budgets" of four terrestrial vertebrates: a 25 gram female deer mouse, a 4-kg female python, a 4-kg male Ad&eacute;lie penguin, and a 60-kg female human (FIGURE 40.13). We will assume that all of these animals reproduce during the year in question.

Fig 40-13. Annual energy budgets for four animals.

The female human spends a large fraction of her energy budget for BMR and relatively little for activity and temperature regulation. The small amount of growth, about 1%  of her annual energy budget, is equivalent to adding about 1 kg of body fat or 5-6 kg of other tissues. The cost of nine months of pregnancy and several months of breast-feeding amounts to only 5-8%  of the mother's annual energy requirements.

A male penguin spends a much larger fraction of his energy expenditures for activity because he must swim to catch his food. Since the penguin is well insulated and fairly large, he has relatively low costs of temperature regulation in spite of living in the cold Antarctic environment. His reproductive costs, about 6%  of annual energy expenditures, mainly come from incubating eggs and bringing food to his chicks. Penguins, like most birds, do not grow once they are adults.

The deer mouse spends a large fraction of her energy budget for temperature regulation. Because of the high surface-to-volume ratio that goes with small size, mice lose body heat rapidly to the environment and must constantly generate metabolic heat to maintain body temperature. Female deer mice spend about 12%  of their energy budgets on reproduction.

In contrast to these endothermic animals, the ectothermic python has no temperature regulation costs. Like most reptiles, she grows continuously throughout life. In the FIGURE 40.13 example, the snake added about 750 g of new body tissue. She also produced about 650 g of eggs. The python's economical ectothermic strategy is revealed by her very low annual energy expenditure, which is only 1/40 of the energy expended by the same-sized endothermic penguin (see FIGURE 40.13b).

Throughout our study of animal biology, we will encounter many other examples of how bioenergetics relates to the form and function of diverse animals.

Having examined some general principles of animal biology, we are now ready to compare how diverse animals perform such activities as digestion, circulation, gas exchange, excretion of wastes, reproduction, and coordination--the topics of the next several chapters.
