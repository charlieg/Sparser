Consider the differences between testosterone and estradiol (a type of estrogen). These compounds are male and female sex hormones, respectively, in humans and other vertebrates (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 4.8</span>). Both are steroids, organic molecules with a common carbon skeleton in the form of four fused rings. These sex hormones differ mainly in the functional groups attached to the rings. The different actions of these two molecules on many targets throughout the body help produce the contrasting features of females and males. Thus, even our sexuality has its biological basis in variations of molecular architecture.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig4-8','../fig/big/fig4-8.jpg','fig4-8');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig4-8.jpg" alt="fig4-8" name="myfig4-8"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 4-8.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">A comparison of functional groups of female (estradiol) and male (testosterone) sex hormones.</span> The two molecules differ mainly in the attachment of functional groups to a common carbon skeleton of four fused rings.

Organic compounds containing hydroxyl groups are called <span class="Emphasis2">alcohols,</span> and their specific names usually end in <span class="Emphasis1">-ol,</span> as in ethanol, the drug present in alcoholic beverages. In a structural formula, the hydroxyl group is usually abbreviated by omission of the covalent bond between the oxygen and hydrogen and is written as--OH or HO--. (Do not confuse this functional group with the hydroxide ion, OH<SUP>-</SUP>, formed by the dissociation of bases such as sodium hydroxide.) The hydroxyl group is polar as a result of the electronegative oxygen atom drawing electrons toward itself. Consequently, water molecules are attracted to the hydroxyl group, and this helps dissolve organic compounds containing such groups. Sugars, for example, owe their solubility in water to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (see <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 5.3</span>).</p><p class="Header3">The Carbonyl Group</p><a name="para34"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">carbonyl group</span> (<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UFIG4-1.jpg">) consists of a carbon atom joined to an oxygen atom by a double bond. If the carbonyl group is on the end of a carbon skeleton, the organic compound is called an <span class="Emphasis2">aldehyde;</span> otherwise the compound is called a <span class="Emphasis2">ketone.</span> The simplest ketone is acetone, which is three carbons long (see TABLE 4.1). Acetone has different properties from propanal, a three-carbon aldehyde. (Acetone and propanal are structural isomers.) Thus, variation in locations of functional groups along carbon skeletons is a major source of molecular diversity.</p><p class="Header3">The Carboxyl Group</p><a name="para35"></a><p class="BlockText">When an oxygen atom is double-bonded to a carbon atom that is also bonded to a hydroxyl group, the entire assembly of atoms is called a <span class="Emphasis2">carboxyl group</span> (--COOH). Compounds containing carboxyl groups are known as <span class="Emphasis2">carboxylic acids,</span> or organic acids. The simplest is the one-carbon compound called formic acid (HCOOH), the substance some ants inject when they sting. Acetic acid, which has two carbons, gives vinegar its sour taste. (In general, acids taste sour.)</p><a name="para36"></a><p class="BlockText">Why does a carboxyl group have acidic properties? A carboxyl group is a source of hydrogen ions. The covalent bond between the oxygen and the hydrogen is so polar that the hydrogen tends to dissociate reversibly from the molecule as an ion (H<SUP>+</SUP>). In the case of acetic acid, we have <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM4-16.jpg">
Dissociation occurs as a result of the two electronegative oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group pulling shared electrons away from hydrogen. If the double-bonded oxygen and the hydroxyl group were attached to <span class="Emphasis1">separate</span> carbon atoms, there would be less tendency for the --OH group to dissociate because the second oxygen would be farther away. Here is another example of how emergent properties result from a specific arrangement of building components.</p><p class="Header3">The Amino Group</p><a name="para37"></a><p class="BlockText">The <span class="Emphasis2">amino group</span> (--NH<SUB>2</SUB>) consists of a nitrogen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms and to the carbon skeleton. Organic compounds with this functional group are called <span class="Emphasis2">amines.</span> An example is glycine, illustrated in TABLE 4.1. Because glycine also has a carboxyl group, it is both an amine and a carboxylic acid. Most of the cell’s organic compounds have two or more different functional groups. Glycine and similar compounds having both amino and carboxyl groups are called amino acids; these are the molecular building blocks of proteins.</p><a name="para38"></a><p class="BlockText">The amino group acts as a base. You learned in Chapter 3 that ammonia (NH<SUB>3</SUB>) can pick up a proton from the surrounding solution. Amino groups of organic compounds can do the same: <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UCM4-17.gif">
This process gives the amino group a charge of +1, its most common state within the cell.</p><p class="Header3">The Sulfhydryl Group</p><a name="para39"></a><p class="BlockText">Sulfur is directly below oxygen in the periodic table; both have 6 valence electrons and form two covalent bonds. The organic functional group known as the <span class="Emphasis2">sulfhydryl group</span> (--SH), which consists of a sulfur atom bonded to an atom of hydrogen, resembles a hydroxyl group in shape (see TABLE 4.1). Organic compounds containing sulfhydryls are called <span class="Emphasis2">thiols.</span> In Chapter 5, you will learn how sulfhydryl groups can interact to help stabilize the intricate structure of a protein.</p><p class="Header3">The Phosphate Group</p><a name="para40"></a><p class="BlockText">Phosphate is an anion formed by dissociation of an inorganic acid called phosphoric acid (H<SUB>3</SUB>PO<SUB>4</SUB>). The loss of hydrogen ions by dissociation leaves the phosphate with two negative charges. Organic compounds containing a <span class="Emphasis2">phosphate group</span> (<IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../img/eqs/UFIG4-2.jpg">) have a phosphate ion covalently attached by one of its oxygen atoms to the carbon skeleton (see TABLE 4.1). One function of phosphate groups is the transfer of energy between organic molecules. In Chapter 6, you will learn how cells harness the transfer of phosphate groups to perform work, such as the contraction of muscle cells.</p></td></tr></table></body></html>
