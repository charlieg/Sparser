This basic body plan has two variations: the sessile polyp and the floating medusa (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.4</span>). <span class="Emphasis2">Polyps</span> are cylindrical forms that adhere to the substratum by the aboral end of the body and extend their tentacles, waiting for prey. Examples of the polyp form are hydras and sea anemones. A <span class="Emphasis2">medusa</span> is a flattened, mouthdown version of the polyp. It moves freely in the water by a combination of passive drifting and contractions of its bell-shaped body. The animals we generally call jellies are medusas. The tentacles of a jelly dangle from the oral surface, which points downward. Some cnidarians exist only as polyps, others only as medusas, and still others pass sequentially through both a medusa stage and a polyp stage in their life cycle.</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-4','../fig/big/fig33-4.jpg','fig33-4');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-4.jpg" alt="fig33-4" name="myfig33-4"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-4.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Polyp and medusa forms of cnidarians.</span> The body wall of <span class="Emphasis2">(a)</span> a polyp or <span class="Emphasis2">(b)</span> a medusa has two layers of cells, an outer layer of epidermis (from ectoderm) specialized for protection and an inner layer of gastrodermis (from endoderm) for digestion. Digestion begins in the gastrovascular cavity and is completed within the gastrodermal cells in food vacuoles. Flagella on the gastrodermal cells keep the contents of the gastrovascular cavity agitated and help distribute nutrients. Sandwiched between the epidermis and gastrodermis is a gelatinous layer of mesoglea. In many medusas, the mesoglea is thick and jellylike--thus the name jellies.</span></td></tr></table><a name="para03"></a><p class="BlockText">Cnidarians are carnivores that use tentacles arranged in a ring around the mouth to capture prey and push the food into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion begins.

The tentacles are armed with batteries of <span class="Emphasis2">cnidocytes,</span> unique cells that function in defense and the capture of prey (<span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.5</span>).

Cells of the epidermis (outer layer) and gastrodermis (inner layer) have bundles of microfilaments arranged into contractile fibers (see Chapter 7). True muscle tissue develops from mesoderm and does not appear in diploblastic animals. The gastrovascular cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton against which the contractile cells can work. When the animal closes its mouth, the volume of the cavity is fixed, and contraction of selected cells causes the animal to change shape. Movements are coordinated by a nerve net. Cnidarians have no brain, and the noncentralized nerve net is associated with simple sensory receptors that are distributed radially around the body. Thus, the animal can detect and respond to stimuli equally from all directions.</p><a name="para05"></a><p class="BlockText">The phylum Cnidaria is divided into three major classes: Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, and Anthozoa (TABLE 33.1; <span class="SmallCap">FIGURE 33.6</span>, p. 650).</p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><table boder="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top" class="text"><a href="javascript:bigFig('fig33-6','../fig/big/fig33-6.jpg','fig33-6');"><img border="0" src="../fig/thm/fig33-6.jpg" alt="fig33-6" name="myfig33-6"></a><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" style="font-size:9pt;"><i>Click image to enlarge</i></td></tr></table></td><td class="figure_caption" bgcolor="#f1f1f1" valign="top"><B>Fig 33-6.</B>&nbsp;<span><span class="Emphasis2">Representatives of the cnidarian classes.
